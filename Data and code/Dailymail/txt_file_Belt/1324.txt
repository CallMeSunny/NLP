If there was little joy for Irish golfers in the Deep South this month, Danny Mullins returned from a 10-day stint in Atlanta and South Carolina with four winners under his belt and confidence galloping through his veins.That sureness was evident in the Boylesports Champion Chase at Punchestown on Tuesday where Mullins allowed Felix Yonger the breather he needed to fill his lungs before blowing out the plucky challenge of Baily Green to capture the first prize of £85,840.Just turned 23, Mullins has crammed more into his fledging career as a professional than most in a career. At 20, he was snapped up by owner Barry Connell as retained jockey, only to lose the high-profile gig last October.         Felix Yonger was ridden to victory at the Boylesports Champion Chase by Danny Mullins on TuesdayMen of lesser fibre may have struggled to cope with the demotion but Mullins grafted away and fed off the chances, which his uncle, Willie Mullins, adroitly put his way.Tuesday's success in the premier two-mile chase for novices was his finest coup so far, and no one was more pleased than Mullins.‘Danny is riding out of his skin. He’s full of confidence and gave Felix Yonger a breather, just when he needed it, before timing his run perfectly,’ said the trainer.

   For the tousle-haired jockey, this was his 22nd win of the domestic season and followed a haul of four wins and two seconds from just seven rides in the ‘States over the past two weekends.‘Numerically, it’s one of the best seasons I’ve had, I’ve been riding in plenty of grade one races, I just had two great weekends in the 'States; I’d call it one of my best seasons yet,’ he said.‘Willie is putting me in for some great rides. I hit the crossbar for him twice at Festival, (Arctic Fire and Milsean), so it’s great to get one at Punchestown.’In an eventful two-miler, the sole British challenger Oscar Hill tumbled at the first where Savello’s blunder cost Bryan Cooper his irons, and his chance.Champagne Fever also slipped at the first under Ruby Wash who reported the favourite was never sparkling.         The win at Punchestown was Millins' 22nd of the domestic seasonTwinlight collided with the wing at the sixth fence while the romantic Flemenstar angle never gathered legs.At the business end, Baily Green and Felix Yonger drew clear of Mallowney at the last before Mullins conjured up a crucial response from the nine-year-old to win by a half a length.It gave owner Graham Wylie, a Newcastle United fan, some reprieve from the Premier League trials of his local club.With a stable bedecked with equine jewels, it requires a 24-carat performance to seize the attention of Mullins.But Douvan’s dazzling display earlier in the Champion Novice Hurdle prompted the master trainer to reach for superlatives.‘I couldn’t see him rising over his hurdles, he hardly moved, he was that fluent.He’s probably as good as we’ve ever had. He could be anything,’ purred Mullins after the five-year-old sluiced home by seven and a half lengths under Walsh from Sizing John.         Felix Yonger strides away from Baily Green in the Boylesports Champion ChaseAs Douvan backed up his Supreme Novices Hurdle win at Cheltenham by following Hurricane Fly (2009), Jezki (2013) and Faugheen (2014) as Punchestown winners, Mullins hinted at a switch to fences next season.‘I can’t wait to see him over a fence. With his size and scope he could certainly go chasing. We’ll talk to the owners, Richie (Rich Ricci) has Faugheen for the Champion Hurdle,’ he said.Mullins completed a grade one treble when Valsour Lido (15/2) bounced back to top form to claim the Growise Champion Novice Chase by two and a half lengths from Wounded Warrior.The eclipse of Don Poli stunned punters, and Mullins too, as the 4/9 shot trailed in last of the five runners.‘He wants a longer trip,’ said Mullins, adding, ‘the Gold Cup is a longer trip, at the pace they go at.’
