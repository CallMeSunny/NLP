 The 30-year-old is prepared to step up in weight to face Lesnar, for a bout he believes would boost both his bank balance and the profile of mixed martial arts.'Obviously Brock Lesnar has millions of followers outside of MMA, which is huge for our sport,' said Jones.'And I feel like Brock has a pretty limited game. I just think it's a winnable fight and there's just so much reward that's involved.'Conor McGregor has shown me that these huge pay days are possible. It's been an inspiration that you can do it. It's like the first guy who went to the moon."Brock Lesnar... Meet me in the Octagon!" üé§@JonnyBones üëä@BrockLesnar üí™The definition of a super fight!! #UFC214 pic.twitter.com/06TOfsQTzf‚Äî UFC on BT Sport (@btsportufc) July 30, 2017           Jones believes most casual fans would love to watch him take on the WWE star         Jones says the meteoric rise of Conor McGregor has inspired him to reach big pay-days'I've no clue where this Brock Lesnar situation first came from or how it started, but it got serious really quick'It would be great for the MMA world and definitely bring more of the general public to mixed martial arts. That's what we need, to expand our sport.'Lesnar appears to be equally keen to take on Jones. Within minutes of the UFC champion's challenge, he said: 'Be careful what you wish for, young man.'However, the pair will have to be patient for the fight to materialise. Lesnar still has another six months of a drugs ban to serve after previously signalling his intention to retire from UFC competition."Jon Jones is back!" üèÜWOOOOOOW! üò±@JonnyBones gets his belt back in truly devastating fashion!!! #UFC214 pic.twitter.com/ddHCadnV6R‚Äî UFC on BT Sport (@btsportufc) July 30, 2017           The pound-for-pound king might have to bide his time as Dana White said it is 'not a reality'He would also have to re-enter the UFC's drugs testing regime to become eligible to return to the promotion.UFC president Dana White said: 'It's fine to talk about, but the reality of it happening anytime soon, is not a reality.'Victory in front of 16,000 fans at the Honda Center cemented Jones' reputation as arguably the greatest pound-for-pound fighter in UFC history.Despite his lengthy absence from the Octagon, Jones showed no signs of ring rust whatsoever as he beat Cormier for the second time in a rematch two-and-a-half years in the making.                Jones feels like he is in his prime as a fighter and can only improve physically and mentally¬†'I feel like the best is yet to come. At 30, I feel like I'm at my physical and mental prime,' he said.'This is my time to start all over and be the champion that the fans deserve.'Cormier was knocked out cold by Jones' third round onslaught, with the 38-year-old left in tears afterwards at suffering another defeat to his fellow American.But despite the pair being involved in a heated war of words between their two fights, Jones paid tribute to Cormier afterwards.         After their epic encounter, Jones heaped praise on the character of Cormier¬†'I've always felt like he's a pretty classy guy, a guy to be respected, a stand-up champion,' said Jones.'But unfortunately, I came into this game at a young age with big ideas. Despite how good of a person he is, there's no mercy in combat and I have to do what I have to do.'I don't think it should ever be questioned whether he was a true champion or not. In my absence, he fought two of the toughest guys in the division and he won those fights.'¬†   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Jon Jones reclaims light-heavyweight crown after brutal KO...
