'Turn out the lights and don't get sick': Darling ridiculed over £11bn efficiency savings... but he won't cut a single public sector job By James Chapman for the Daily Mail   Updated: 15:21 BST, 25 March 2010    


              334 View  comments   Darling denies hiding tax hike for millions Chancellor stands by 'rosy' economic forecastDoubt grows over £11bn 'efficiency savings'Osborne: First priority to axe National Insurance hikeCameron: It's dishonest and fails on every count Alistair Darling's Budget was condemned as 'empty nonsense' today as it emerged it contains a £27billion black hole. After experts denounced his picture of the economic future as 'wildly optimistic' and many of his measures as cheap electioneering, the Chancellor defended his plans.He again rejected calls to slash public spending sooner and denied hiding a tax hike for millions in what was his final Budget speech before the election.But he faced incredulity over his suggestion that Government departments can make 'efficiency savings' of £11billion - without cutting a single job.Mr Darling claimed the savings could be achieved 'without damaging front-line services' by taking measures such as turning off the lights in Government buildings.On top of this prediction, there has been no explanation for how an extra £27billion in cuts outlined in Treasury documents will be achieved.It raises suspicions a savage spending squeeze that will see frontline services and jobs slashed is being delayed until after the election to avoid upsetting militant unions.               Election Budget: Alistair Darling and George Osborne today Instead of outlining the cuts, Mr Darling asked voters to believe the route to recovery lies in a £15billion stealth tax on middle earners and yet more cash for public services.In a 'phoney' Budget that could be redundant within weeks if the Tories win power, he vowed to keep the spending flowing this year - setting out plans for a £30billion increase.He insisted it was too 'dangerous' to start cutting back now - but admitted tough savings would have to be made after 2011. Under his plans, an unimaginable £734billion will be borrowed over the next six years, taking the national debt to £1.4trillion. He said it was only fair that those who have done well in Labour's boom years now helped to balance the books. But he failed to spell out that millions will be hit by frozen income tax allowances next month and a 1p rise in National Insurance next year.

 Today, he stood by his rose-tinted forecasts and insisted slashing spending sooner was too risky.'If we took public spending away now we'd risk tipping the country back into recession. That is not a risk I'm willing to take,' he said.He rounded on the Tories for being 'conspicuously silent' about their own tax and spending plans and denied claims he had hidden a tax hitting 30million workers.The Conservatives have warned tens of millions will be hit by an effective tax increase because personal allowances have been frozen despite a 3.7 per cent inflation rise.But Mr Darling insisted the allowances had been frozen because they were set last September and claimed increasing them would cost £2billion.  'If that really is their policy they need to say where the money is coming from,' he told GMTV.      Tory leader David Cameron condemned the statement as 'empty' and 'more of a dead end' today as analysts at independent think tank the Institute of Fiscal Studies prepared to deliver their verdict.'There was just no energy in it, no ideas to get the economy moving, nothing to get this country growing again. They're neither dealing with the debt, which is a big black cloud over this economy, nor are they actually taking action to get the economy moving,' he said.'I think it fails on every count, and it certainly fails on the count of honesty. Where was the mention of the national insurance that's going to hit every business in this country? Where was the mention of the freezing of the personal allowances which are going to hit every taxpayer in this country?'We've got to have budgets in future that actually bear some relation to the taxes and proposals made by the Government.'Amid a clamour for the Tories to be more open about their own plans, he outlined how he would aim to tackle the record debt if he wins power.'We need to make a start this year, we shouldn't put off what needs to be done. But I can guarantee to people, with a Conservative government we will show leadership, we will cut the fat of politics and Whitehall first. We will make sure this is done fairly and reasonably, and it's vitally important to demonstrate we're all in this together.'We'll cut out waste first - things like the national identity card which we think is a terrible mistake - let's do those things so we can take the whole country with us. We do need some leadership, some dynamism from our Government, instead of the empty nonsense we heard yesterday.'Asked what his Budget would have contained, Shadow chancellor George Osborne added: 'I would have got to grips with the waste, the bloat, the excessive spending that got Britain into the problem it faces today. 'I would have set out a credible plan to deal with the debts, that would have protected our country's credit rating, kept interest rates lower for longer, and avoided the ever-increasing spiral of taxes which seem to come from this Government to working people.' He also said he would try to avoid tax rises on workers by dealing with 'bloated government waste' and reiterated that  his first priority would be to avoid the National Insurance rise, which has been branded a 'tax on jobs' by retailers.        My one and only: Chancellor Alistair Darling shares his big day with wife Margaret in Downing Street yesterday     Pledges: Economists said the Government's plan to halve the deficit over four years from 2011 was dangerously dependent on rose-tinted forecastsBoth the £11billion of 'efficiency savings' and £27billion in other cuts have already been pencilled in by the Treasury and will make no difference to the mountainous Government deficit, which will hit £167billion this year.   Ministers have begun to sketch out details of how they will save cash. In total, 16 Government departments issued statements saying how they would contribute but the plans do not include a single job cut. Instead, they rely on vague pledges to 'streamline back office costs', trim marketing budgets and making sure less staff go off sick.  Opposition MPs have dismissed them as 'vacuous'.In a sign of growing union militancy, the Chancellor yesterday had to cross a picket line manned by civil servants in the first ever Budget Day strike in a row over redundancy pay. He sought to shore up Labour's core vote by hitting homes worth £1million with stamp duty rises to pay for a two-year 'holiday' from the tax for first-time buyers of properties worth less than £250,000.  SAVING THE GOVERNMENT: THE 'EFFICIENCIES' PROMISED BY MINISTERS Department of Health: £4.35 billionIncludes £1.5 billion through cheaper procurement, £555 million by reducing staff sickness.Local Government: £2.1 billionIncluding from 'greater collaborative procurement'.Department for Children, Schools and Families: £1.1 billionIncludes £650 million pounds from more efficient procurement in schools.Ministry of Defence: £700 millionIncludes £120 million from cheaper procurement, £130 million by replacing old computer systems.Department for Work and Pensions: £350 millionIncludes £180 million from getting 'better value' from contracts with suppliers and reducing demand.Home Office: £350 millionIncluding savings at UK Border Agency and cheaper consultancy costs.Ministry of Justice: £343 millionIncludes relocating 1,000 posts out of central London by 2015, merging the Courts Service and the Tribunals Service and abolishing 19 Courts Boards.Department for Business, Innovation and Skills: £300 millionIncludes £180 million from savings in back office costs, consultancy and procurement.Treasury, HM Revenue and Customs: £261 millionDepartment for Communities and Local Government: £200 million Includes £130 million of savings from cheaper procurement.Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: £194 million Includes savings from cheaper procurement and consultancy.Department for International Development: £150 millionIncludes savings on back-office work, procurement and consultancy.Department for Transport: £90 millionIncludes streamlining back office functions.Department for Culture, Media and Sport: £60 millionSavings from lower procurement, back office and consultancy costs.Foreign Office: £50 millionDepartment of Energy and Climate Change: £30 millionCabinet Office: £25 million He froze the inheritance tax threshold for another four years to help pay for the costs of care for the elderly. That will see increasing numbers of middle class families dragged into the tax net.  Economists said the Government's plan to halve the deficit over four years from 2011 was dangerously dependent on rose-tinted forecasts for economic growth. The Chancellor is predicting the economy will bounce back by 3.25 per cent next year - compared to an average of 2.1 per cent forecast by independent forecasters. If experts are right and Mr Darling is wrong, more than £10billion will have to be added to borrowing next year. The day brought ominous signs of what has been happening under Labour. In a display of the growing union militancy plaguing Britain, the Chancellor had to cross a picket line of civil servants on strike in a row over redundancy pay. And an official report quietly published under cover of the Budget revealed that 25,000 people in the bloated public sector are pocketing salaries of over £100,000 a year. But Mr Darling insisted Labour had been 'right about the recovery' and said he was able to reduce this year's deficit forecast by £11billion thanks to increasing tax revenues. He hailed small businesses as the 'backbone' of the recovery and announced a cut in business rates for a year from October. State-owned banks, meanwhile would be told to lend more to small firms.But angry business leaders said the £245million package was dwarfed by the £4.5billion 'tax on jobs' in the form of next year's National Insurance rise.In a forensic attack on the Budget, Tory leader David Cameron compared Gordon Brown's stewardship of the economy to the performance of the captain of the Titanic. He said it was clear Labour had nothing to offer voters except 'debt, waste and taxes'. Mr Cameron pointed out that the Chancellor's most eye-catching policies - the stamp duty cut for first-time buyers and big tax rises on strong cider - had been stolen from the Tories. He said Labour had run out of ideas and had 'totally failed' to heed alarm bells ringing across the world over the scale of Britain's deficit. Mr Cameron declared: 'They have doubled the national debt and on these figures they are going to double it again. 'Like every Labour government before them, they have run out of money and they are leaving it to the next Conservative government to clean up the mess.' LibDem Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said the Government was 'just ducking serious choices'.        Neil O'Brien, director of the Policy Exchange think tank, said: 'The Government could have finally told us where the axe is going to fall, and challenged the opposition parties to say how they would have done things differently. 'Instead, the Government will now go into the election simply refusing to tell the electorate which items of spending they would cut, or which taxes they will raise. We will be asked to sign a blank cheque.' Opposition MPs pointed out that the planned ' efficiency savings' do not appear to involve a single public sector job cut and come largely from backoffice functions like IT, consultants and administration or by cutting sickness and energy bills. Mr Cable said: 'There is a complete lack of candour, a complete lack of specifics about the big cuts that we all know are coming'. The City barely reacted to the Budget, with the FTSE 100 index finishing 4.3 points higher.Your tax at a glanceThese tables show how tax and National Insurance changes this April and in 2011 will affect your income.
