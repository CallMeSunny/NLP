WHAT IS THE KUIPER BELT?  The Kuiper Belt is one of the largest structures in our solar system - others being the Oort Cloud, the heliosphere and the magnetosphere of Jupiter. Scientists are still just beginning to explore and our understanding is still evolving. Its overall shape is like a puffed-up disk, or donut. Its inner edge begins at the orbit of Neptune, at about 30 AU from the Sun.The inner, main region of the Kuiper belt ends to around 50 AU from the Sun. Overlapping the outer edge of the main part of the Kuiper Belt is a second region called the scattered disk, which continues outward to nearly 1,000 AU, with some bodies on orbits that go even farther beyond.            How was the Kuiper Belt created?Astronomers think the icy objects of the Kuiper Belt are remnants left over from the formation of the solar system. Similar to the relationship between the main asteroid belt and Jupiter, it's a region of objects that might have come together to form a planet had Neptune not been there. nstead, Neptune's gravity stirred up this region of space so much that the small, icy objects there weren't able to coalesce into a large planet. Credit: NASA
