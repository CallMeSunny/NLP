Animal rights groups have released graphic videos of day-old male chickens being 'macerated' - which is essentially the same as being minced - while still alive.The undercover footage, the first of its kind obtained in Australia by the groups, shows the male chicks being killed at a hatchery in Melbourne, one of the largest in the country, which supplies chicks to farms.According to the Animal Liberation group, Australian egg industry grinds up over 12 million day-old chicks every year.Scroll down for video          An Animal rights group have released graphic video footage of day-old male chickens being sorted and 'minced' on a conveyor belt while still alive at a hatchery in Melbourne (pictured)         The Australian egg industry grinds up over 12 million day-old chicks every year, the Animal Liberation group said of the undercover footage (pictured)        In a statement, the group said because male chicks do not produce eggs and because the egg-laying breeds of chickens used by the industry did not grow large or fast enough to be raised for their flesh, the male chicks were 'trash' to the industry.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 2 Next       What happened to going to the pub?

 The group said maceration occurred in hatchery systems supplying battery, free range, and organic egg laying chickens. Animal Liberation campaign director Emma Hurst said: 'Male chicks only hours old are thrown into high speed industrial blenders with blades that mangle and slash the young chicks to pieces. These chicks are fully capable of feeling pain and deserve protection from this abuse. 'No one can reasonably argue that this isn't a welfare issue- it is barbaric. The Australian Egg Corporation and NSW Farmers Egg Committee should be making the same commitment as Germany and the US to stop the mass culling of day old male chicks.'          The male chicks are killed because they do not produce eggs and because the egg-laying breeds of chickens used by the industry did not grow large or fast enough to be raised for their flesh, the group said         'We've known about this process for a long time, but it's been very highly-guarded by the industry,' Aussie Farms director Chris Delforce saidAussie Farms director Chris Delforce said: 'We've known about this process for a long time, but it's been very highly-guarded by the industry – nobody's been able to capture it here in Australia until now. 'I think most people would be absolutely horrified to learn that this is what they're paying for when they bug eggs, even those with ostensibly higher-welfare labels like "free range".' Germany has just called a ban of this practice by 2017 and the US has committed to stop by 2020.Australian egg producers are refusing to make the same commitment risking consumer backlash.          'I think most people would be absolutely horrified to learn that this is what they're paying for when they bug eggs, even those with ostensibly higher-welfare labels like "free range"'         Australian egg producers are refusing to make the same commitment risking consumer backlash
