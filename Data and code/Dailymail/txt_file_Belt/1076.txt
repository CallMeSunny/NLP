If you thought all the film premieres were currently taking place at the Venice Film Festival, then think again.
Yes the romantic Italian city has stars like Tilda Swinton and Natalie Portman but London's Westfield shopping centre has Cate Blanchett and Jack Black at the first screening of their movie The House With A Clock In Its Walls. And we're sure the Hollywood A-listers are thrilled to be here not there...
Either way Cate looks divine in a gorgeous green dress from Gucci's Resort 2019 collection. What's not to love about this elegant creation? The colour is beautiful, the pleating from the waist so chic and we're crazy about the ruffle detail too.
So it's just a shame it won't be available to buy for a while. Until it is, why not browse the green midis we've found in our edit below? Ghost's take is lovely and will look fantastic styled with a pair of high heel sandals.
