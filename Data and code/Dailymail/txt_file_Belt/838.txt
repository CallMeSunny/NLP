Keep up with Kylie in a Janessa Leone wool fedora




Janessa Leone Stephen Fedora

Kylie Jenner seems to have a penchant for leather baseball caps but in this Instagram snap she switched up her sporty headwear for a chic fedora. 
The felt stunner was by Janessa Leone and came in a soft blue hue that was embellished with a steel band. The LA based brand is inspired by vintage pieces and counts Jessica Alba, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Chrissy Teigen as fans. 
We love a good fedora as a finishing touch to a bohemian ensemble. Wear it with a flowy peasant blouse, jeans, and knee high riding boots this winter.
Kylie's hat is up for grabs at Barneys New York (click right to buy). Or get the look for less in our edit below.
