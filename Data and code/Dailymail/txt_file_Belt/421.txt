 The San Francisco Giants activated first baseman Brandon Belt from the 10-day disabled list before Saturday's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Belt, 30, has not played since a scary incident June 1 in which left a game against the Philadelphia Phillies complaining that he did not feel well. He quickly was taken to a local hospital, where doctors performed an emergency appendectomy. Teammates did not learn until after the game that he had surgery. Less than three weeks later, Belt is returning ahead of schedule. He could be a strong candidate for the National League All-Star team after hitting .307 with 11 home runs and 31 RBIs in 53 games before his setback. He has a .403 on-base percentage and a .547 slugging percentage, both of which represent career highs through the first 2 1/2 months of the season. The Giants optioned right-hander Pierce Johnson to Triple-A Sacramento to clear a spot on the roster. The 27-year-old Johnson went 3-2 with a 5.46 ERA in 24 relief appearances this season. He walked 15 and struck out 20 in 31 1/3 innings. --Field Level Media
