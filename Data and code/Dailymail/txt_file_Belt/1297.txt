Millie Mackintosh stepped out looking her usual chic self today in a coolly casual ensemble that consisted of ripped jeans paired with a simple white tee, black vinyl boots and an oversized coat.
She was certainly not going to feel the chill in that outerwear. We adore the cuddly looking teddy finish of this coat by Ducie. It's made from faux sheepskin and if you want to buy it for yourself, click right to head to the website where it's up for grabs for £325.
It might be nearly April, but the weather is very unpredictable right now, you just never know when it might snow next! So it's never too late to bag yourself a warm coat, plus, this pick will never go off trend so you can don it year after year.
