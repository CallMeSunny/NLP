We know what is best for us - we innately know. But I was scared to trust my instincts, and less strong because of it. 'We can be paralyzed by fear, and I’d like to think of myself as someone who steps into fear and into the sharp corners. And yet, we all have our weaknesses, and there are areas where I was afraid to trust my instincts, and I don’t want to do that anymore.'         Cover girl: Featuring on the magazine's cover in a striking white long sleeve gown, the Million Dollar Baby star said if she could give advice to her younger self she would say 'trust yourself'Hilary was in her mid-twenties when she landed her first Oscar for her portrayal of transgender man Brandon Teena in the 1999 biographical indie film Boys Don't Cry.While at the top of her game, the star said it is only now she sees the strength in herself.She told the magazine: 'I just turned 40, and as you grow and have hindsight, you feel less alone. When you’re in your twenties and thirties, you feel like, ''Am I the only one feeling this?'' And in your late thirties to forties you start feeling that we’re all going through something, and the more we share our experiences, the less alone we are.'          Young star: Hilary was in her mid-twenties when she landed her first Oscar (pictured) for her portrayal of transgender man Brandon Teena in the 1999 biographical indie film Boys Don't CryHilary says now she is driven to being true to herself.'The need to embrace our strength. To embrace my strength. To not shy away from what I believe in because of what anyone might think. On the flip side, I also embrace my femininity.'The star also pulls inspiration from the roles she picks, which has included everything from a woman who lives as a man, a karate hero, a boxer and now a woman living off the land who is not afraid to challenge male dominance in new film The Homesman.The 40-year-old said: 'I’m drawn to women who defy stereotypes - women who remind us how multifaceted we are.'In her new film, the actress stars opposite Tommy Lee Jones, who also directed and co-wrote it.The pair find themselves stuck together in the old West frontier transporting three insane young women from Nebraska to Iowa.'[Working with Tommy] was extraordinary. I had such a great time that I didn’t want it to be over. 'He’s a true artisan and visionary. To be directed by someone like that, who has such a strong opinion, is wonderful because you’re in sure hands.'The film also gave her a chance to return to her roots, the star told the magazine.'It’s my roots. I was born in Nebraska. My family lives in Iowa. I come from a generation of farmers, so it’s definitely in my blood.'That was a big draw for me, but I’d say that more of a draw was that the character I play, Mary Bee Cuddy, a woman who has values, morals and manners, which, in my opinion, are qualities that at this moment we’re lacking as a culture. I thought, what a great, great woman. What a great person.'The film explores issues that are timeless, and things that we’re still doing now, in 2014. Even though it takes place in the mid-1800s, I connected to it as a woman.'The Homesman is in theatres on November 14.         New role: The 40-year-old plays frontier woman Mary Bee Cuddy in film The Homesman, which also stars Tommy Lee Jones
