Police cars' 'In God We Trust' decals draw complaints By Associated Press   Published: 15:48 BST, 6 September 2015  |  Updated: 15:48 BST, 6 September 2015                e-mail         DALLAS (AP) â€” A police department in a rural Texas Bible Belt community has placed large "In God We Trust" decals on its patrol vehicles in response to recent violence against law enforcement officers. But a national watchdog group is contesting the decals as an unlawful endorsement of religion.The decision this month to unveil the phrase in Childress follows a similar move by dozens of other police agencies elsewhere in the country. Leaders cite patriotism or other reasons for adding the phrase to vehicles.But the Wisconsin-based Freedom From Religion Foundation says the First Amendment prohibits government from establishing a religion.Jeremy Dys with the Liberty Institute in Texas counters that federal courts have allowed the phrase and other religious overtures as "part of the country's history and heritage."
