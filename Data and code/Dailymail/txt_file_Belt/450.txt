Adam Voges Shield Player of the Year By Australian Associated Press   Published: 06:12 BST, 20 March 2015  |  Updated: 06:12 BST, 20 March 2015                e-mail         At age 35 there are no retirement plans for West Australian batsman Adam Voges.In fact, with 1215 runs under his belt, the Warriors skipper reckons he's had a career-best first-class season and still has hopes of Test selection.The hefty run count, which includes a personal best of 249 against South Australia in February, has seen the right-hander named Sheffield Shield Player of the Year."It's obviously a great honour to win the award and it's topped off for me personally, my best season by far," Voges told reporters in Hobart on Friday ahead of WA's Shield final against Victoria.During his 10 matches of the season, Voges has five centuries, and said he's pleased to have been able to capitalise at the crease."I've been able to go on and score some big runs (and) I've been part of some really big partnerships," he said."I think our top five or six batters have clicked really well all year and to be part of those big partnerships has been really important."While Voges is focused on securing the Shield title, which in 2014 eluded the WA finalists, he admitted he retains hopes of donning the baggy green."I've always said that I'd love to play Test cricket for Australia. That certainly has never changed in any way," Voges said."My focus always has been predominantly to play for WA and score as many runs as I possibly can... and I'm really pleased that we can play the Shield final."And while some players may be considered to be nearing the end of their career at age 35, there are no such thoughts for Voges."While I'm contributing and while I'm enjoying my cricket and while my body holds together, I'll keep going," he said."There's certainly no timeframe or deadline on my career at this stage."
