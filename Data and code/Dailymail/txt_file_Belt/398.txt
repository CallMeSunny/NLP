Conor McGregor's next opponent could be revealed this weekend and no, we're not talking about Floyd Mayweather.The Irishman may be insisting that his next fight will be against the undefeated boxer inside the squared circle but his employers, the UFC, seemingly have other ideas.McGregor has been angling for a mega-bout with Mayweather for months with his UFC contract seemingly the biggest stumbling block to any potential agreement.         Conor McGregor's next opponent could be revealed in the UFC 209 co-main event               Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson will square off for the interim lightweight title And president Dana White has made it clear that he fully expects his star asset's next competitive appearance to be inside the octagon, against the winner of this Saturday's UFC 209 interim lightweight title showdown between top contenders Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson.'I don't know where we're at,' White told TMZ when asked about the Mayweather fight. 'We're nowhere. We're nowhere with it.'I expect Conor's next fight to be in the UFC, in mixed martial arts, and the winner of Khabib and Ferguson.’And for MMA purists, fearing a Mayweather bout in the ring could do serious damage to the sport, that is exactly what they hope materialises.         Nurmagomedov is a dominant wrestler and has never been beaten inside the octagon         Ferguson is renowned as an elite striker and makes use of his deadly elbows The meeting between Nurmagomedov and Ferguson represents one of the most highly-anticipated and competitive fights in recent UFC history, with the former proclaiming it to be the 'greatest lightweight fight ever.'Why is that?

 With a following in Russia similar to that of McGregor's in Ireland, the extraordinarily powerful sambo master is widely considered to be the biggest threat to the Notorious' 155 pound title.'The Eagle' felt he was long overdue for a shot at UFC gold and made it clear that's what was next for him when he faced Michael Johnson at UFC 205 in November, a show headlined by McGregor.Taking the dangerous American down at will, Nurmagomedov dominated Johnson with a vicious display of ground and pound, only pausing to shout at White, sitting cageside, telling him that he must fight for the title and that he would 'smash' his 'boy' (McGregor).         Nurmagomedov has repeatedly asked for title fights and has been rewarded 'I want a fight with your chicken (McGregor) because this is No 1 easy fight in the lightweight division,' the Russian told the crowd following his emphatic submission victory.'Die like Irish warrior don't run like chicken,' he would go on to say. 'Irish people have history and fight for long time, you need to represent your people with honour.’McGregor would claim the lightweight strap in brilliant fashion against Eddie Alvarez later than night before revealing he was set to take a break due to his girlfriend's pregnancy.Nurmagomedov's refusal to accept anything other than a title bout left the promotion with little choice other than to put an interim belt up for grabs. And that's where the division's other standout challenger comes in.         'El Cucuy' trains with Eddie Bravo and possesses a high level of Brazilian jiu-jitsuNo 2 contender Ferguson comes into this clash on a nine-fight win streak, a five-year run that reached its peak when the Ultimate Fighter season 13 winner outclassed former champion Rafael dos Anjos in Mexico at the back end of last year.Aggressiveness is the hallmark of ‘El Cucuy’s’ game and his unorthodox, pressure-based, style is a problem for anyone.With a seemingly never ending gas tank, the fierce American is dangerous whether the fight stays standing or hits the mat.In terms of competitiveness, this is as good as it gets. The grappling advantage on the side of Nurmagomedov, the striking edge in the hands of Ferguson.And it’s not just the duo’s skill sets that has fans purring over this contest as the two have shown legitimate dislike for one-another.         Nurmagomedov offers a telling glance to Ferguson entertaining the crowd on stage         Ferguson's nine successive victories have thrust him into contention in the 155-pound divisionFerguson has maintained that his opponent is a ‘f****** bully’, vowing to ‘break his spirit.’‘I’m going to put so much pressure on this kid’ he told the media on the UFC 209 conference call last week. I’m going to hit him so hard in his stomach, I hope this dude takes a knee and if he doesn’t, I’m going to take him down then let him up and beat him mentally. This dude has no f****** way, no way to beat me on my way to victory.’In what was one of many fiery exchanges between the lightweights over the past couple of months, Nurmagomedov chuckled and replied: ‘I’ll show you my spirit on Saturday.’         ‘I’m going to break your spirit, Ferguson responded with Nurmagomedov quick to retort ‘I want to break your face – I want to break your heart.’‘Your hat is covering your ears – you’re not listening to me,’ Ferguson said. “f*** you, Khabib. You didn’t do nothing. I’m the matador. You’ve got 1.9 million people that are going to be sad as (expletive) when I finish your ass.’One of few things they do agree on is that they are battling it out for what they consider to be the division’s ‘real belt.’Both have claimed McGregor is ‘running’ from them but what lies ahead of them is the golden ticket to the biggest fight in the game.If McGregor plans on returning to the octagon and keeping his title, he will have nowhere to run.
