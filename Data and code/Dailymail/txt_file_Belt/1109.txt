Tailoring is a huge trend right now, but why stick to business-like pinstripes or block colours? 
Beyonce showed us how it's done when she attended the opening of an art exhibition wearing a statement printed suit and matching hat. She's not one to do things by halves! 
The whole thing was made just for Queen Bey by Ena Gancio, a designer who uses traditional African-inspired prints in modern silhouettes. 
If your wardrobe is missing a suit then why not give this look a go? We particularly like the idea of teaming it with trainers for a fresh and relaxed approach to tailoring, switching to heels for a big occasion. Click (right) to find out more at Etsy.
