But last night, as the Camerons welcomed celebrity guests to number 10 for a Children in Need event, it was clear that Samantha is every bit as fashion forward as her young invitees. Ms Cameron chose a simple green patterned sheath dress from high street store Cos for the event, complete with demure short sleeves and a thin black leather belt that encircled her slim waist.The PM's wife reportedly purchased the dress last summer for around £69, and last night was deemed the perfect occasion to wear it.The choice of the high street label is not an entirely unusual choice for Ms Cameron, who has frequently chosen to wear high street labels including Cos in the past. When she does wear designer brands, she enjoys British brands such as Burberry and Emilia Wickstead, with lesser known designers over big catwalk labels such as Erdem, Philip Lim and Christopher Kane all finding a place in her wardrobe.She is very aware of what suits her, choosing narrow silhouettes, round necks and simple accessories, and although she is adventurous with designers and prints, she never strays into fashion victim territory.In her role as creative director of luxury accessories brand Smythson, Samantha has been behind the creation of many successful products, including the Nancy and the Maze bags, which were seen on the arms of such celebrities as Madonna and Cat Deeley. Mrs Cameron stepped down from her full-time £400,000 role at the accessories brand two days after her husband became Prime Minister. However she still works for the company as a creative consultant for around two days a week.'As a creative consultant working two days a week I will be involved in all the same areas as before, however I will not be directly responsible for them,' she said at the time.'I look forward to my changed role and balancing it with my new day-to-day life as well as being able to spend more time with my children,' she added.With a sister, Emily Sheffield, who works as the deputy editor of fashion bible Vogue, Samantha is certainly well-placed to stay at the forefront of the changing fashions.

 Indeed, SamCam's style is widely admired by fashion industry's elite who have previously voted her as one of the country's most stylish women on lists published by both Vanity Fair and Vogue magazines.    Vogue called her a 'great ambassador for British fashion', singling out an Erdem dress she wore during the election campaign and a floor-length Osman gown worn for the British Fashion Awards. 'She's really clever at knowing what shapes suit her and she made maternity dressing look effortless', they added.                Demure: The slim-fitting dress had short sleeves and a thin belt encircling SamCam's slender waist        Samantha Cameron and Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed celebrities to Downing Street for a Children in Need event                  SamCam more than held her own among the other stylish stars, including presenter Fearne Cotton, who attended the reception
