The range is full of low plunge necklines, drape effects, thigh splits, lurex minis, side split maxis and cut outs. 'The slinky asymmetric dresses are the perfect festive go-to dresses. I love that the hem line on the skirt isn’t straight as it makes it a little more risqué. It shows the perfect amount of leg! 'I love the shape and design so we decided to include it in the range in two colour ways- black as the perfect LBD and ultramarine for a flash of warmth in the Winter,' said Fleur. The starlet is the latest in a string of celebrities to collaborate with Lipsy, following the likes of Kim, Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian, who teamed up for their sell-out Kardashian Kollection previously.Fleur will also follow in the footsteps of former Coronation Street star Michelle Keegan, whose line with the brand has also flown off the shelves.          Fleur said: 'I absolutely love this time of year - I particularly love getting dressed up, so designing a super glam range to wear for the party season was an amazing opportunity'         Taking inspiration from the catwalks, the range has an underlying 70s inspired vibe with slinky jersey fabrication       As well as launching her range for Lipsy, Fleur has, of course, been busy making music in the recording studio, which she reveals is going 'very well.'The singer spent much of the summer in Los Angeles where she was busy recording her debut album, which already has been given the thumbs up by her boss and X Factor mogul, Simon Cowell.He told The Sun: 'I've heard it and it's world class. She has discovered who she wanted to be. Sometimes you just spot someone who's not obvious and Fleur's a good example of that.'  And the future is certainly looking bright for the songstress, who is being likened to Rihanna and has some serious ambition. She told FEMAIL: 'In five years' time, I will hopefully be on album number five and touring the world; fingers crossed! 'And If all goes well with fashion, hopefully another fashion line!'.
