He was arrested within a few days of their deaths.'Mr Langdon said Crook had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and had been under the care of doctors since the murders.'In more recent times, his condition has improved so that he is now able to comprehend the case against him, instruct his lawyers and so advance his defence in court,' Mr Langdon added.
