Astronaut breaks US record: 521 days in space and counting By Associated Press   Published: 18:11 BST, 24 August 2016  |  Updated: 18:11 BST, 24 August 2016                e-mail         CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Astronaut Jeffrey Williams has a new record for NASA under his space belt.The commander of the International Space Station marked a U.S. recording-breaking 521st day in orbit Wednesday, a number accumulated over four flights. That surpasses the 520-day record set by Scott Kelly, whose one-year space station mission ended in March.By the time Williams returns to Earth in two weeks to close out his latest half-year trip, he will have logged 534 days off the planet for NASA.

Space station veteran Peggy Whitson will top that after she flies up in November for another six-month stay. She's already at the 377-day mark for total space time, a record for a woman. And even that won't come close to the world record of 879 days held by Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka — a total of 2 ½ years.Kelly, who is now retired from NASA, called Williams from Mission Control in Houston and offered congratulations "on passing me up here.""It's great to see another record broken," Kelly radioed. "But I do have one question for you. And my question is: You got another 190 days in you?"Williams replied, "That question's not for me, that's for my wife." He thanked Kelly for accepting the one-year stint "so I didn't have to."Williams recalled telling his wife, Anna-Marie, and the rest of his family that if he did the one-year flight versus his current six-month assignment that he'd be back six months earlier — in March."That never flew with anybody," he confided.As it is, Williams will be No. 14 on the world's most-time-in-space list, behind 13 Russians, by the time he lands.Williams, 58, a retired Army colonel, rocketed into orbit in March along with two Russians. They will return via a Russian Soyuz capsule to Kazakhstan on Sept. 7. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk next week before heading home.___Online:NASA: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html        FILE - In this Friday, March 18, 2016 file photo, NASA astronaut Jeff Williams, a member of the main crew of the mission to the International Space Station (ISS), waves prior his rocket launch at the Russian-leased cosmodrome in Baikonur, Kazakhstan.
