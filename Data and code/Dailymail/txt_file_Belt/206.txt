Olympic gold medal or world heavyweight championship belt?Which of those glittering prizes shines most brightly in the mental trophy cabinet of the new powerhouse poster boy for British boxing?Anthony Joshua is torn.         Anthony Joshua celebrates after winning the IBF world heavyweight title on Saturday night at the 02 Arena         Joshua (right) overwhelmed American 'Prince' Charles Martin in just two rounds to take his IBF belt         The Englishman knocked Martin down twice in round two and the referee was forced to call an end to the bout Of last Saturday night, when he ripped the IBF crown away from American pretender Charles Martin as if taking candy from a truculent child, he says: ‘The crowd in the O2 were fantastic. It was a great evening and also my reward for all the hard work we’d put in. No matter who the opponent, you don’t win world titles by accident. I micro-manage every little thing in my life and for this one we had the ultimate 12-week training. This feels good.’But then he remembers: ‘This is still only the job a quarter done. I want all the other belts, to take two off Tyson Fury and one off Deontay Wilder. That will be class. Like the Olympics.’The unified heavyweight championship and ‘the Josh decade of world dominance’ are his promises to a growing army of fans, 20,000 of whom generated what he relished as ‘that tremendous atmosphere’ as he flattened Martin inside two rounds.

   But as yet it is still that summer evening at the 2012 Games which has pride of place in this fighting heart.‘That was the Spartan night,’ he says.The highest decibel counts of the London Olympics were recorded for boxing at the ExCel Arena, coming to a crescendo for the last event of the Games, the super-heavyweight final between the 22-year-old Joshua and Italy’s experienced world amateur champion, Roberto Cammarelle.Joshua says: ‘How many people were in the athletics stadium, 80,000? Yet the loudest noise was at the boxing. How crazy is that? Incredible.’         Joshua celebrating with his Olympic gold after winning the super-heavyweight title at London 2012         Joshua beat Italian Roberto Cammarelle (right) in the final at the ExCel Arena in London          Tyson Fury (left) is the leading heavyweight after beating Wladimir Klitschko and Joshua is keen to fight himHe likens it to the Colosseum in Rome: ‘At the O2 you can sit quietly in your dressing room before the fight. Not at the Olympics.‘There you are locked away back stage in what feels like a cage. You can hear the roars of the crowd. They are baying for blood and you’re the next to come out. That is the stuff of gladiators.’Joshua carried the burden of high expectations into the ring against Martin but says: ‘The pressure was greater for the Olympic final. Amateur boxing is a serious business. Those guys are elite and many of them have been around that game for years. It’s tough.‘I knew Cammarelle was very good. It still came as a shock when my corner told me I was three points down going into the third round. But I usually came on strong in the last and I did so again.’                Joshua's right hand was too powerful for Martin, who was unbeaten heading into his first title defence         Joshua (centre) celebrates winningthe IBF world title at the O2 in London on SaturdayA relieved Joshua was then awarded the gold on countback after the judges scored it an 18-18 draw.No such anxieties pervaded the thunderous winning of his first world title. Not during the brief fight. Not before. He says: ‘I knew I would beat Martin. I knew I had it won the first time I hit him hard. I knew he wouldn’t get up the second time.‘In some ways I would have preferred it to be a ding-dong. More exciting for me and the fans.’The Olympic spirit still lives in the man called AJ. He is hoping for more patriotic golds in Rio and then expects UK super-heavyweight Joe Joyce to come after him the way he himself is closing in on a Battle of Britain with Fury next spring.‘So it goes in this game,’ he says. ‘Joe wins his medal and then comes up behind me. I will welcome it.’Once his ‘decade of dominance is over,’ Joshua wants to rejoin the UK squad as a coach. He says: ‘I love everything about it. The team spirit, the innocence, the hope, the ambition, the dedication. I will love going up and down to the training camp in Sheffield. Rain or shine – so thankfully I should be well enough off to have a driver.’In his more immediate future AJ is planning two O2 Arena title defences this year – one against an American, the other against an IBF rated challenger – en route to Wembley Stadium spectaculars against Fury and David Haye next spring and summer.Of the last two he says: ‘They are now part of my era. We have to fight each other. The way (Lennox) Lewis, (Evander) Holyfield and (Mike) Tyson had to fight each other. Silly not to.’Lewis, still the last heavyweight to hold the undisputed championship, believes another couple of experience fights is the sensible path for his would-be successor.                Joshua (second left) hopes to rejoin the Olympic squad as a coach once his fighting days are over         Joshua said 'I knew I would beat Martin' following his conclusive victory on Saturday night While praising Joshua for ‘being clever in grasping the opportunity offered by Martin and knocking out that muppet,’ Lewis adds: ‘Anthony is still work in progress and is not quite ready yet for Fury and Haye.’Meanwhile, another gleaming prize may well come Joshua’s way. The odds are shortening on this dynamic but also delightful young man being voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.David Haye, having been chased around London by a large, aging, bearded, dreadlocked American screaming ‘Let’s Go Champ,’ has made an initial concession for the sake of some peace and quiet.London’s former cruiser and heavyweight world champion is giving Shannon Briggs a spot on the undercard of his second comeback fight at London’s O2 Arena, on May 21.Briggs lost world heavyweight title fights to Lewis and Vitali Klitschko in a career currently spanning 59 wins, 52 KOs and just six defeats. At 44 he is still hollering for a piece of the action.A harassed Haye has promised to fight Briggs himself, on condition that ‘Shannon the Cannon’ looks good in beating an as-yet unnamed opponent.Haye says: ‘He’s been banging on my gym door, barging into my press conferences, scaring my secretary half to death. I’m going change this ‘Let’s Go Champ’ movement into ‘Let’s Go Chump’. Because that’s what he is.’Whoever he meets, Briggs should supply a colourful curtain-raiser to Haye’s bout with the 29-fights unbeaten Arnold Gjergjaj.
