   The British Boxing Board of Control (BBBoC) confirmed the failed test to Sportsmail on Thursday night, but it is not yet clear if the 29-year-old’s fight will be cancelled because the substance is only banned by Wada in competition. In the US and Britain that typically means the day of the fight.The Voluntary Anti-Doping Agency conducted the test. In the eyes of the BBBoC, the controversial fighter does not have a case to answer, though a decision on his forthcoming fight will be in the hands of the Massachusetts State Athletic Commission.         The controversial 29-year-old fighter is the current WBO middleweight world champion BBBoC general secretary Robert Smith told Sportsmail: ‘According to our rules and those of UK Anti-Doping, he has not committed a breach. It is down to Massachusetts over what happens next.’The issue has arisen in the same week that Saunders was fined £100,000 by the board after a video surfaced of him asking a woman to perform a sex act on a passer-by in exchange for drugs.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 2 Next       Billy Joe Saunders fined £100,000 after asking woman to...
