One passenger took 'selfies' with Mustafa which were posted on social media.Mustafa had taken charge of the early morning flight by showing flight attendants what appeared to be a belt stuffed with plastic wires and a remote control. After directing the flight to Cyprus, he asked for the release of female prisoners in Egypt, and to come in contact with his Cypriot ex-wife. (Writing by Michele Kambas; Editing by Catherine Evans)
