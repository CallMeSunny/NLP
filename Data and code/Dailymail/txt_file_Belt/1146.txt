 Rousey, who had been hoping that Friday's fight would turn a new leaf for her career, left the cage pitifully, flanked by her mother.The former champion suffered the first defeat of her career in November last year against rival Holly Holm. She had been teasing out her return on social media ahead of UFC 207, posting photos of her training and showing off her leaner physique.Rousey's own mother called for her daughter to retire after her brutal defeat.'I think she's sad and disappointed like anybody would be in the circumstances,' AnnMaria De Mars told TMZ Sports.'I think making snap decisions like that is probably not the best idea, so I don't know, but I would like to see her retire.'I would like to have seen her retire a long time ago. Who wants to see their kid get hit? She's got a lot of talent in a lot of other things. She could do movies, writing, producing. She's really really smart and beautiful.'              Rousey (pictured after the fight was stopped Friday) had teased her returned on social media but her future in the sport is now compromised after her stunning defeat         After the fight was stopped, Rousey left flanked by her mother AnnMaria De Mars (pictured), who later said she would like to see her daughter retireBut Rousey never managed to get her footing against Nunes, who rocked Rousey with her very first punches. Rousey showed little defensive acumen as she staggered and stumbled backward with Nunes relentlessly pursuing her and landing 27 punches in the brief bout. Rousey's future in the sport is clearly in question. The biggest star in the women's game, who left the arena without giving an interview, is likely considering retirement shortly before her 30th birthday.'That's it for her,' Nunes said. 'For sure, she's going to retire.'Justin Bieber also rubbed salt in Rousey's wounds on Friday. The two have feuded for the past year, since Rousey said he had refused to take a picture with her sister at the Cannes Film Festival. Bieber had then mocked Rousey for her defeat against Holm in an interview. He did the same thing on Twitter Friday, writing: 'You just got knocked the f*** out.' Rousey, who had been on a media blackout ahead of the fight, has yet to comment publicly on her defeat or plans for the future.          Nunes (pictured celebrating her victory Friday) later said: 'I knew I was going to beat [Rousey]. I'm the best on the planet'. She first earned her bantamweight belt in July         The Brazilian champion gave her girlfriend Nina Ansaroff a victory kiss after defeating Rousey in just 48 seconds, successfully defending her bantamweight title
