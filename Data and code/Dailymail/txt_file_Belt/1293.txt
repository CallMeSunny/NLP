Jennifer has always been one of our favourite stars and she always looks great whenever she's out and about. She's got a pared back style mantra that takes few risks but always looks chic. 
This daytime ensemble is a good example of her laid back approach to fashion. Khaki utility trousers, a black tee and biker jacket and practical wedged boots.
If anything it's the boots that stand out. They're a favourite of Jen's and it's easy to see why with their luxe suede finish, pretty buckle fastenings and elongating heel that are easy to walk in. They are by Michael Kors but sadly are no longer available to buy. 
For those of us who would like to steal her style though there are loads of great options on the high street that will give you the look while saving you money. See below for options by Kaleidoscope, UGG and more.
