The house The Jam built: Bruce Foxton, bass guitarist in the famous Seventies band, is looking for a new Start By Fred Redwood for MailOnline   Updated: 14:50 BST, 24 January 2011                     2 View  comments   Bruce Foxton of The Jam - one of the most successful bands of the late Seventies and early Eighties - has two things on his to-do list for 2011.His first is to sell his house in the commuter belt village of Wonersh near Guildford, Surrey, which is on the market for £1.55million. And secondly he wants to cement his reconciliation with Paul Weller, his childhood friend and The Jam's former frontman.       To do list: Bruce Foxton wants to cement his reconciliation with Paul Weller, his childhood friend and The Jam's former frontman Neither will be easy as Bruce is still coming to terms with the death nearly two years ago of his wife of 25 years Pat. 'This house is full of fond memories of her. But now I have got to move away from here and get on with my life,' says Foxton, 55. He fell out with Weller in 1982 when the singer suddenly broke up the group to form The Style Council, but Pat's final illness played a part in bringing the two former friends back together again. 'Pat battled cancer for several years and Paul phoned her when she was very sick in hospital,' says Foxton. 'After that I played three numbers on stage with Paul at a Royal Albert Hall gig last year. Paul has also played on the album I'm currently making with my new band and now I'm hoping he'll guest on some of our shows when we play the songs live,' says Foxton whose present band is called From The Jam. Foxton and Pat, who was a record company PR working for Abba, Michael Jackson and George Michael, moved to their Wonersh house in 2000, buying it for £750,000 - about the same price they received for their previous home, just across the road.       Finale: The house in the Surrey commuter belt is on the market for £1.55million  'We moved because we wanted a bigger garden,' says Foxton. 'But this house was too small for us so we spent another £200,000 extending it. Pat had a big say in how it was to look.' The couple added an extra room, the lounge, at one side and extended the kitchen at the opposite end. Upstairs, two extra bedrooms were added, to make five in total. The most surprising thing about his home, bearing in mind that Foxton played with a major band who had 18 consecutive Top 40 hits and three No1s to their name including Start!, is its lack of rock star 'bling'. Apart from the unobtrusive jukebox in the kitchen there is nothing list for 2011. rock 'n' roll about it at all. 'Portraying a flash image wasn't really what The Jam was about,' says Foxton, by way of an explanation. 'Celebrity bashes and hanging out with stars wasn't us. We were the bloke next door band and we kept our feet reasonably on the ground.' Foxton has certainly lived by that dictum. Born and brought up in a council house in nearby Woking, he has never strayed far from this patch of Surrey, living previously in Woking itself, then Bramley and, later, the house opposite. 'I trained as a printer at Unwin Brothers and my mother didn't want me to pack it in until she saw me on Top Of The Pops,' he says. 'I still count the guys I worked with from those days as my best friends. I have travelled the world with my music but there is nowhere else I'd rather live than around here.' In the years since The Jam broke up, Foxton has made a living as a bass guitarist, even though he has never matched the record sales of those early years. For 15 years he played with the Northern Irish punk band Stiff Little Fingers. Now he has formed From The Jam, mainly playing songs from the original band's heyday. To a modern audience he will be best known as the singer of his own composition, News of The World - the theme tune for TV's Mock The Week. A For Sale sign in Wonersh Park should cause a stir locally as homes in this up-market, leafy, Thirties development are much sought after. 'You are only five minutes from Guildford railway station and the schools around here are excellent,' says Serena Brown of selling agents Brown's. 'The house will go to a City high-flier with a young family.' Foxton wants to remain in his beloved Surrey. 'I don't need to down-size,' he says. 'I just need to find the same sort of house nearby where I can make a fresh start.' www.brownsestateagents.com
