 TJ Dillashaw surrendered the UFC bantamweight belt Wednesday, announcing he was informed by the New York State Athletic Commission and the United States Anti-Doping Agency of an "adverse finding in a test taken for my last fight." The New York governing body also suspended him for one year and issued a $10,000 fine, citing "violations relating to use of a prohibited substance." The suspension is retroactive to Jan. 19, the date of the fight. Dillashaw (16-4) said "while words can't even begin to express how disappointed I am at this time, please know that I'm working with my team to understand what has occurred and how to resolve this situation as quickly as possible. Out of fairness and respect to the rest of my division, I've informed the UFC that I'll be voluntarily relinquishing my title while I deal with this matter." The 33-year-old had held the title since November 2017, his second title reign, claiming the belt in a knockout of Cody Garbrandt at UFC 217. --Field Level Media
