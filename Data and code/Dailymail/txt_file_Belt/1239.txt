It’s long been suspected that Jupiter once orbited a different path before reaching its current position roughly five astronomical units from the sun.But, the timing of Jupiter’s formation and migration has eluded scientists.Now, a rare class of meteorites known as ‘CB chondrites’ suggests Jupiter sat somewhere near the asteroid belt at its current size about 5 million years after the first solid objects formed in the solar system.Scroll down for video          Meteorites known as ‘CB chondrites’ suggests Jupiter sat somewhere near the asteroid belt at its current size about 5 million years after the first solid objects formed in the solar system.

 While chondrites are common, CB chondrites are among a rare subgroup.‘The chondrules in other meteorites five us a range of different ages,’ Johnson said.‘But those in the CB chondrites all date back to this brief period 5 million years after the first solar system solids.’         Computer simulations in the new study, published to the journal Science Advances, show that Jupiter’s gravity could have created the right conditions for such impacts.

CB chondrites also contain metallic grains that appear to have been condensed directly from vaporized iron, the researcher explainsIn the most extreme simulation, a 90-kilometer wide object slammed into a 300-km object at a speed of roughly 33 km per second.This would have vaporized 30-60 percent of the larger body’s iron core, creating the necessary material for CB chondrites.And, the researchers found that the increase in impact velocities would have been short lived, lasting just 500,000 years – which amounts to very little on the cosmic timescale.Though their findings support the Grand Tack migration, they also note that other scenarios could still be on the table.Regardless, they say they’ve arrowed down the timing of Jupiter’s presence in the inner solar system.‘In retrospect, it seems obvious that you would need something like Jupiter to stir the asteroid belt up this much,’ Johnson said.‘We just needed to create these models and calculate the impact speeds to connect the dots.’
