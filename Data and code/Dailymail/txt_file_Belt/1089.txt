WHAT IS ULTIMA THULE?The Kuiper Belt object was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2014. Officially known as 2014 MU69, it got the nickname Ultima Thule in an online vote.In classic and medieval literature, Thule was the most distant, northernmost place beyond the known world.         Ultima Thule might not be a single object. Scientists say it's possible it's two or many objects. An artist's impression is pictured When New Horizons first glimpsed the rocky iceball in August it was just a dot. New Horizons will make its closest approach in the wee hours of Jan. 1 - 12:33 a.m. EST.Scientists speculate Ultima Thule could be two objects closely orbiting one another. If a solo act, it's likely 20 miles (32 kilometers) long at most.Envision a baked potato. 'Cucumber, whatever. Pick your favorite vegetable,' said astronomer Carey Lisse of Johns Hopkins.It could even be two bodies connected by a neck. If twins, each could be 9 miles to 12 miles (15 kilometers to 20 kilometers) in diameter.Scientists will map Ultima Thule every possible way. They anticipate impact craters, possibly also pits and sinkholes, but its surface also could prove to be smooth.
