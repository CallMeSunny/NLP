Look lovely in lilac in a dress by Ryan Lo

Lady Mary Charteris attended the Ryan Lo show at London Fashion Week today and naturally she was wearing a look by the designer.
The DJ and singer opted for this very pretty lilac print maxi dress from the SS19 collection and we love its romantic Bohemian vibe. It would actually make a gorgeous bridesmaid dress but Mary keeps it edgy with her tinted shades and layered jewellery.
Lilac has been making inroads into our wardrobe for a few months now and it looks like the trend is still going strong as we move into spring. It's the perfect shade for bright sunny days so if you'd like to copy Mary's look why not head to our edit below where you'll find more pastel hued maxis to browse.
NastyGal has a great option with cute ruching or check out more versions by Blue Life, Coco Riko Ibiza and TIARE HAWAII.
