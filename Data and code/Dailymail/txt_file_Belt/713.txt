 WASHINGTON, April 2 (Reuters) - The United States will not send high-level officials to attend China's second Belt and Road summit in Beijing this month, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said on Tuesday, citing concerns about financing practices for the project. China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, said on Saturday that almost 40 foreign leaders would take part in the summit due to be held in Beijing in late April. He rejected criticisms of the project as "prejudiced." (Reporting by David Brunnstrom; Editing by Sandra Maler)
