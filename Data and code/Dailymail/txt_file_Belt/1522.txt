The sly-de fox: Appearing to enjoy himself, the cub, aged about four months, rides the quarry conveyor belt in Germany The 56-year-old, who now lives in Bursfelde, said: 'One morning I arrived at the quarry and saw from a distance two young foxes playing on the conveyor belt.'One ran back to the top of the conveyor belt and then started to walk back down it, stopped and sat down.

 'After a few seconds it started to slide down the conveyor belt using its front paws to drag it forwards.'They were attracted to the conveyer belt because it was a playground to them.'I have not seen this type of behaviour amongst free living wild animals and I was really surprised and pleased to witness and capture this unusual event.'I had to react quickly and knew that the chances of getting a decent image was slight.'I thought the odds were really against me but that morning fortune was on my side.' Mr Usher, orginally from Allendale, Northumberland, spent three weeks at the quarry before he managed to capture the elusive foxes at play.He said: 'Obviously my determination paid off in the end. It was really a combination of repeatedly going back to the same spot and patience.'I knew from past photographic experience that if I remained persistent, something unusual or worthwhile can, or may happen.'A large portion of luck also helped.'
