Mariah Carey, Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Connelly, Heidi Klum, Miranda Kerr and the very dapper David Beckham were all there, and since the event was presented by Louis Vuitton, there was of course a whole of LV on the blue carpet. 
Selena Gomez really sent temperatures in her red hot leather dress, which is from the Resort 2016 collection. You might think that once you've seen one awards season gown you've seen them all, but the zip front, ruffle neckline and monogram cut out detailing makes this dress very unique.
