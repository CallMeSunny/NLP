Number of new houses being built in England up a third in a year but still 26% below the last decade's peak133,650 houses are currently in the process of being builtNumber of homes completed in last 12 months hits 112,630But completions and starts are still far below pre-crisis peaks By Lee Boyce    Published: 11:19 BST, 15 May 2014  |  Updated: 12:57 BST, 15 May 2014               e-mail          39 View  comments    The number of new houses currently being built in England jumped 31 per cent in just 12 months according to statistics released this morning by the Department for Communities and Local Government.In the past year, 133,650 houses are now in the process of being built compared to 101,670 recorded at the same point last year. North and east above London's green Belt has seen a boom in building, from Essex and Cambridgeshire, to Leicestershire and onto Suffolk and Norfolk.        Hotspots: These maps show where new starts are mainly concentrated. On the left the deep blue shows the areas with most growth, on the right the green shows where housing starts are up annually. The data comes two months after George Osborne said Britain had to 'get building' with the construction of tens of thousands of new homes in the coming years.As well as a boost to the number of homes being started on, completions are also up according to the DCLG. In the last 12 months, 112,630 homes were completed compared to 107,820 in the same report last year. However, despite the growth in both completions and starts, new housing construction remains far below pre-recessions peaks.   More...   Is the bubble about to pop? Anxiety builds over uncertainty in tumultuous UK housing market  BofE should not hesitate to cool the property market if it sees major house price risks, says Osborne  Can you find a better deal? Mortgage tables   Housing starts are 26 per cent below their March quarter 2007 peak, but are 113 per cent higher than the trough in the March quarter of 2009.Starts were strongly affected by the economic downturn and from the start of 2008 there was a period of rapid decline. Completions are now 43 per cent below their peak in the March quarter 2007 but 12 per cent higher than last year. The maps above  from the DCLG of the 326 local authority districts, show the pockets of England where starts have been most abundant, with the M3, M4 and M5 corridor and areas north of the London green belt in Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire showing the biggest signs of growth:  The highest rates of completions are found in a band starting north of the London green belt in Essex and running through Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire, Leicestershire and on into Suffolk and Norfolk.The lowest completion rates in the last year are in Merseyside and North Yorkshire.        On the rise: The number of starts have soared in the last 12 months          Houses: The data shows the proportion of starts are largely houses rather than flats  Housing Minister Kris Hopkins said: ‘It’s taking a massive government effort to get Britain building again and today’s figures show it’s working – in no small part thanks to the measures we’ve taken to help aspiring homeowners onto the property ladder.’A lack of housing has been largely blamed for property price rises. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, says: ‘Limited supply of houses is a factor pushing up prices in an increasing number of areas.’He points to the latest Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors data which indicates the headline sales-to-stock ratio rose to 38 per cent in April from 37 per cent in March - the second highest reading recorded post-2008.It also marked the seventh consecutive month above its long run average of 32 per cent. RICS commented that: ‘The imbalance between demand and supply continues to be a key driver of price appreciation with growth in new buyer enquiries remaining firmly positive at the headline level while new instructions contracted slightly for the fourth consecutive month.’Peter Williams, executive director of the Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association, said: 'House building is finally moving in the right direction but whether it is doing so fast enough and with enough urgency remains to be seen. MORTGAGE LENDING SLOWSData from the Council of Mortgage Lenders this morning showed mortgage advances were up 17.4 per cent year-on-year to 50,500. This figure is down from recent increases around 30 per cent year-on-year and the overall increase of 27 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter.A large symptom of this has been the Mortgage Market Review rules making it harder for homebuyers to obtain lending and a lack of housing supply.  'We are battling against a deep deficit of new homes across the UK and a 31 per cent annual rise in new starts still leaves us staring into the abyss of a severe supply problem as population pressures grow.'Campbell Robb, chief executive at charity Shelter, said: ‘Any uptick in housebuilding should be welcomed, but the worrying reality is that we are still building less than half the homes we need.‘Successive governments have failed to build enough homes to keep up with demand, and the result is thousands of young people and families forced to watch their dream of a home of their own slip further and further out of reach.‘Solving the housing shortage is possible, we just need politicians to roll up their sleeves and commit to the solutions that will create a healthier housebuilding market for the long term: from boosting small builders with government guarantees, to getting land into the hands of those who can build the affordable homes we need.’In the Budget, Osborne said a new development of a garden city at Ebbsfleet in Kent will provide 15,000 homes.Mr Osborne said the development of Ebbsfleet - on the high speed rail link to the Channel Tunnel - would build on the example of 20th century developments such as Letchworth, Welwyn Garden City and Milton Keynes.This morning, a report claimed that the majority of families will rent, rather than own, their homes within a generation. At its peak in 2003, 71 per cent of households in England were owner occupied.Today the figure is just 65.2 per cent amid predictions it will drop even further. The report, based on research by a former Bank of England economist and published today by the Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association, said the trend will continue across the UK.By 2032, it predicts less than half – 49.2 per cent – of households in the UK will be homeowners.
