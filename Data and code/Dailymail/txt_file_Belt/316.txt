Say YES to yellow like Versus-clad Halsey




Versus Versace Spring/Summer '17
View the full collection here!

American singer Halsey made quite the appearance on the red carpet at the iHearRadio Music Awards clad in this bold yellow outfit from Versus Versace's SS17 collection. 
The current climate might not make you think of the sunshine hue but, trust us, it's THE colour of the moment, and it's time to get in on the trend, ASAP. 
SS17 saw major flashes of yellow on catwalks from Chloe to Chanel and Parisian heavy weight Celine. If that isn't enough to prove that the tone cuts the mustard, it also looks set to stick around for next season. AW17 Fashion Week has only just come to an end, and yellow was all the rage at Balenciaga and Valentino. 
If you've got the confidence to rival Halsey's by all means work the tone head-to-toe. Our advice? Incorporate the colour into your look but wearing one vibrant piece, paired with more neutral tones. Why not sport Boohoo's high waisted pants with a fitted grey knit and sneakers? For more of an elegant look opt for Topshop Unique's hot-off-the-catwalk wide leg trousers with a cream lace cami and leather jacket.
