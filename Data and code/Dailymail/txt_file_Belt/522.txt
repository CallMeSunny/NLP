Wild cheers greeted Donald Trump Saturday night as he took a victory lap following a decisive primary election win that pushed his bitter rival Jeb Bush out of the race entirely.With victories now in South Carolina and New Hampshire, Trump is the prohibitive favorite to win the Republican presidential nomination: No GOP candidate has ever won in both of those states without going on to represent his party in the general election.The billionaire Republican front-runner struck an uncharacteristically genial tone toward his two main challengers Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. shushing his crowd when they booed them.'Ted and Marco did a really good job and they did quite well as I understand,' Trump said during a victory speech that was beamed around the world.'No, just one minute,' he said as catcalls rang out. 'We go back to war tomorrow morning.'He gave them both credit for enduring a grueling schedule and risking their reputations in a protracted slugfest.'There's nothing easy about running for president!' Trump exclaimed. 'It's tough, it's nasty, it's mean, it's vicious. It's beautiful.'Scroll down for video           Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican primary, a second-straight victory for the billionaire real estate mogul after his first-place finish in New Hampshire         Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a South Carolina Republican primary night event while flanked by his family members         The billionaire Republican front-runner struck an uncharacteristically genial tone toward his two main challengers Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, shushing his crowd when they booed the two first-term senators         Donald Trump's wife Melania Trump breaks her usual silence and to talk up her husband's  candidacy after he won the South Carolina Republican primary       Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump speaks as the candidate's family celebrates victory in the South Carolina primary         rump (second right) touches the stomach of his pregnant daughter Ivanka (second left) as he addresses supporters       'When you win,' he said, 'it's beautiful.''Let's put this thing away!' he urged, calling on supporters in a dozen states set to vote March 1 to come to the polls for him.With more than 99 per cent of precincts reporting results in the Palmetto State, the billionaire had captured 32.5 per cent of the vote in a six-way contest.Second was Rubio with 22.5 per cent. Cruz was just behind him in the third-place position with 22.3 per cent, with barely 1,000 votes separating the two first-term senators.Former Florida Gov Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson made up the bottom half of the Republican results table with 7.8 per cent, 7.6 per cent and 7.2 per cent, respectively.The contrast between Trump's triumphant speech and Bush's more somber tones from moments earlier was striking.'I firmly believe the American people must entrust this office to someone who understands that whoever holds it is a servant, not the master,' the former Florida governor said – someone with 'decency.''I'm proud of the campaign that we've run to unify the country, and to advocate conservative solutions ... but the people of Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina have spoken and I really respect their decision,' he said.'So tonight I am suspending my campaign.''No!' Bush's audience shrieked.'Yeah. Yeah,' he replied, choked up.Bush also motioned to his wife, explaining that with her at his side, it would all be OK.'I've had an incredible life and, for me, public service has been the highlight of that life, but no matter what the future holds, here's the greatest safety landing if you can imagine,' he said.'Tonight I'm going to sleep with the best friend I have and the love of my life.' Hours later former President George W. Bush, who campaigned for his younger brother in South Carolina, said in a statement that he told Jeb 'how proud I am of him and his staff for running a campaign that looked to the future, presented serious policy proposals, and elevated the tone of the race. Jeb's decision to suspend his campaign reflects his selfless character and patriotism,' the former president said.Ben Carson, who finished the night lower than Bush on the tote board, vowed to stay in the race no matter what. 'I'm not going anywhere,' he told supporters.Trump never mentioned Bush's name on Saturday night but mocked election analysts who predicted he could lose ground as his rivals quit their campaigns.'A number of the pundits said, "Well, if a couple of the other candidates drop out, if you add their scores together, it's going to equal Trump!"' he mocked during his victory speech.

Former Florida Gov Jeb Bush suspended his bid for the White House on Saturday, following disappointing results in the primaries       Bush would likely have faced pressure from GOP leaders and donors to drop out had he stayed in the race         Bush quickly slid in the polls behind some of his more outspoken Republican rivals such as billionaire businessman Donald Trump and Texas Sen Ted Cruz, who have billed themselves as anti-establishment alternatives to the early front-runner       Bush put on a brave face as he told supporters on Saturday that he was stepping out of the presidential race          Bush goes to kiss his wife Columba while announcing that he is suspending his presidential campaign       Jeb Bush told supporters that he had a great 'safety landing' in his wife Columba Bush, who tearfully stayed to his side as he dropped out of the presidential race tonight in South Carolina        'These geniuses. These geniuses. They don't understand that as people drop out I'm going to get some of their support.'Ted Cruz had praise for Bush, calling him 'a man who ran a campaign based on ideas, based on policy, based on substance.And in an unspoken comparison with Trump, he said the Floridian was 'a man who didn't go to the gutter and engage in insults and attacks.'Cruz claimed he was effectively tied with Rubio for second place, and hinted that he was licking his chops for a general election debate against 'Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, or whatever other socialist they nominate' on the Democratic side of the political ledger.He boasted, based on his surprising win in the Iowa caucuses, that his is 'the only campaign that has beaten, and can beat, Donald Trump.'Rubio also acknowledged Bush, his former mentor, saying that he 'has many things to be proud of.''He's an extraordinary husband. He's an extraordinary father. He was the greatest governor in the history of Florida.''And I believe and I pray that his service to our country has not yet ended,' Rubio said.But he also predicted despite his lack of any statewide wins, that he 'will win the nomination.'

 'Practically speaking,' he said, 'It's down to three.''Tonight here in South Carolina, the message is pretty clear,' he said. 'This country is now ready for a new generation of conservatives to guide us into the 21st century.'The Democratic National Committee's chairwoman, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, unsurprisingly said Saturday night that the Republicans would ultimately fall flat in November. 'There is no longer any question over just how out-of-touch and extreme today’s Republican party has become,' she said in a statement. 'Despite their best efforts to disrupt Trump’s momentum, the rest of the Republican field has faltered even as they've spewed campaign rhetoric as extreme as his.''Whether it's Ben Carson's daily confusion and reports that he is running out of cash or Marco Rubio's growing desperation to spin his way out of three consecutive losses ... the once Grand Old Party is now the Party of Trump.'Trump brought his family onstage including sons Eric and Don Jr., daughters Tiffany and Ivanka, and wife Melania. Ivanka is just days away from delivering a baby.'We have a hospital ready just in case,' Trump said.         Florida Sen Marco Rubio reacts at his South Carolina primary night headquarters in Columbia, South Carolina         Rubio gestures to supporters alongside South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley (left) at primary night on Saturday         Rubio waves to supporters alongside South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley at primary night rally on Saturday       'It could be any second. It could even be before I finish!'Melania, the candidate's third wife, called South Carolina 'an amazing place.''Congratulations to my husband. He was working very hard. ... he will be the best president!' she gushed.'This is an amazing, amazing night,' Ivanka added from the podium.'My father is an incredibly hard worker and he'll be working for each and every one of you,' she pledged.Saturday's win will add new momentum to what threatens to become an unstoppable election year Trump juggernaut.The Donald was declared the winner with just 2 per cent of the votes counted in what amounts to his second solid victory in as many weeks.More than 1,000 Trump supporters at his victory party in a Spartanburg, South Carolina, hotel ballroom chanted We Want Trump!' We Want Trump!' and cheered every time CNN, which was playing on flat screen TVs, announced an update in the counting.By the time he hit the stage, they were shouting 'USA! USA! USA!'The win keeps Trump firmly in the front-runner slot as the GOP race moves to Nevada next week for the state's caucuses, and then to a dozen races held on 'Super Tuesday', March 1.It also solidifies the sense in South Carolina that the state's Republicans have undergone a monumental shift from a genteel, center-right majority to an angry conservative one.That's the same transition the GOP is seeing nationwide – with Trump casting himself as the champion of frustrated voters who have lost patience with a divisive White House and believe President Barack Obama has weakened the United States.Trump, the unlikely Republican front-runner who made his fortune in real estate and reality television, led every poll in South Carolina since mid-November.That made Saturday night's topline result a largely foregone conclusion and set up a fierce battle for second place.The same dynamic played out in New Hampshire eleven days ago, with Trump crushing the field and Ohio Gov John Kasich stealthily slipping past his noisier rivals to grab the silver medal.Although the real gap between silver and bronze can be paper-thin, as Rubio and Cruz are seeing, the practical impact will be huge in terms of momentum and fundraising.Only Trump, who is funding his own bid – his campaign committee accepts donations but he never asks for them – can afford a poor finish.He has yet to see one.         Republican presidential candidate, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, arrives for a South Carolina primary night rally at the South Carolina State Fairgrounds in Columbia         Cruz, accompanied by his wife, Heidi, and their two daughters, Catherine, four, and Caroline, seven, react to the crowd at a South Carolina primary rally at the South Carolina State Fairgrounds in Columbia       Cruz had praise for Bush, calling him 'a man who ran a campaign based on ideas, based on policy, based on substance'       Trump seemed to know all along that keeping his rivals bunched together in the distance was his best-case scenario, batting down Cruz and Rubio every time either one seemed to have the upper hand.As Cruz in particular surged among Christian-right voters, he played up the Texas senator's recent reputation as a decidedly un-Christian cheater and liar.Cruz 'lies more than any human being I have ever seen,' Trump told a rally audience Friday night in North Charleston, hitting him for a heavily run TV ad that uses dated footage to paint Trump as holding positions that he abandoned years ago.He also blasted Cruz for a dirty-tricks campaign against Carson that involved telling Iowa caucus-goers that the African-American doctor was pulling out of the race.Trump had good reason to play hardball.One South Carolina poll this week showed his lead narrowing to just 3 percentage points over Rubio, and another had him reduced to a five-point victor over Cruz.But single-digit margins were exceptions in a race that had The Donald ahead by as many as 20 this month.His final margin of victory will be closer to his average edge in recent polls, about 13 per cent.But in a tweet The Donald fired off a few minutes after polls closed, he said he didn't care if his opponents were breathing down his neck.'People (pundits) gave me no chance in South Carolina. Now it looks like a possible win,' he tweeted. 'I would be happy with a one vote victory! (HOPE)'On Friday, Trump told a series of capacity crowds on the state's Atlantic coast that he didn't want to take anything for granted.'You have to assume we're tied!' he said in Myrtle Beach. 'Go out and vote!With Saturday's win, Trump will claim most if not all of South Carolina's 50 delegates to July's Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio.The end of Jeb Bush's campaign came as little surprise to campaign watchers.Reports surfaced Friday of Bush campaign staffers shopping their résumés and donors fleeing to Rubio and Kasich.A few campaign insiders insisted the brother of one former president and the son of another is committed to collecting as many delegates as he can, for as long as he can, in the hope that a chaotic primary season will lead to a 'contested' convention.In that scenario, delegates become currency. And the man who controls the largest number of them will have the most to say about who emerges from the resulting cacophony as the presidential nominee.It was not to be, and Jeb ended his bid for a third Bush presidency with no delegates at all in his corner.         Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson visits voters in a restaurant during the Republican presidential primary in Spartanburg, South Carolina         Following Saturday's primary, Ben Carson, who finished last, vowed that 'I'm not going anywhere'. Pictured above, he speaks at a rally on Friday       With Bush and Carson floundering, and Kasich fleeing South Carolina for more hospitably moderate New England states before the voting was over, Rubio and Cruz were Trump's main in-state competition all along. Cruz, the hard-charging tea party senator from Texas, staked his claim on an army of nearly 10,000 volunteers – mostly from the evangelical-heavy upstate region – charged with recruiting Bible-thumping conservatives to vote for him.Meanwhile Rubio, a baby-faced Florida senator, relied on high-profile endorsements from the popular South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, the African-American senator Tim Scott and the right-wing Rep. Trey Gowdy, who chairs the congressional committee investigating Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's Benghazi terror-attack scandal.Saturday's outcome will give new weight to Republican Party insiders' fears that the maverick Trump can run the table and sew up the GOP's presidential nomination quickly unless the so-called 'establishment lane' condenses to just a single candidate.Cruz remains as much an outsider as Carson and Trump, despite holding a U.S. Senate seat. But Rubio is competing for oxygen with Bush and Kasich, who are more centrist White House hopefuls.Most early Republican primaries award convention delegates proportionately according to the percentages of votes won.Beginning on March 15, state Republican parties are permitted to hold 'winner-take-all' contests, and many will do so.That means Trump could scoop up massive numbers of delegates by scoring razor-thin victories and never winning a single outright majority, unless the field thins enough for a single 'establishment' candidate to combine votes from party moderates and challenge him effectively.The South Carolina primary is an odd hybrid, and it's possible Trump could claim every delegate at stake on Saturday.Some of the state's delegates are aligned with its seven congressional district – each gets three for a total of 21.Twenty-nine more 'at-large' delegates are awarded in a single block to the winner of the election.So if Trump out-polls his rivals in each of the seven congressional district in addition to winning statewide, all 50 delegates will be his.Nervous party elders want 'anyone but Trump,' a Republican National Committee official told DailyMail.com, requesting anonymity since he is not authorized to speak to the press.'It's better for the party if we get a two- or three-man race, and get it quickly,' the official said Saturday afternoon.'Having 17 candidates at the beginning set the stage for Trump and allowed him to stand out,' the official added. 'And right now his opposition is spread too thin. It's time it began to consolidate.'Reached after Trump was declared the winner on Saturday night, his spokeswoman Hope Hicks fired back.         Ohio Gov John Kasich wasn't in South Carolina for the primary on Saturday, but hosted a watch party in Wakefield, Massachusetts         Kasich greets supporters after speaking during the watch party in Wakefield, Massachusetts, on Saturday         n Kasich, center, walks through the crowd after speaking during the primary watch party and campaign rally on Saturday       'If RNC leadership wants to continue to attack the front-runner,' she said in an email, 'they should do so on the record and we will respond in kind.'Future primary contests could see new levels of tension between the Republican party's 2016 standard-bearer and a party power structure that would be more comfortable with a Bush or a Kasich flying its colors.An hour before the polls closed, a consortium of TV networks that participate in so-called 'exit polling' released data collected in interviews with South Carolina voters outside their polling places.They predicted a record turnout and found a Republican electorate with strong pro-Trump leanings.Fully three-quarters of the GOP primary voters on Saturday said they support a signature Trump proposal, temporarily banning non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. in the wake of December's terror shooting in San Bernardino, California.That number outstripped support for such a measure among Republicans in New Hampshire, where Trump lapped the field.And more than 40 per cent said they favor deporting illegal immigrants, another position that mirror's Trump's pledge to use a 'deportation force' to restore law and order.Trump also won convincingly on the question of which candidate the state's Republican voters believe is best equipped to handle the U.S. economy.Other exit-poll results, though, suggested Cruz might have an edge.Nearly three in four voters said they were evangelical Christians, part of the demographic that lifted the senator to victory in Iowa. Trump's win in New Hampshire came with a pool of voters where only one-quarter were 'born again.'And nearly half said it mattered to them 'a great deal' that a presidential candidate should share their religious faith.One exit-poll result raised a giant question mark as voters anxiously awaited poll-closing time: Fully 38 per cent of South Carolina Republicans told pollsters they decided whom to support within just a few days of voting.         Out West, Hillary Clinton pulled out a crucial win over Bernie Sanders in Nevada's Democratic caucuses, easing the rising anxieties of her backers         Sanders congratulated Clinton on her victory, but then declared that 'the wind is at our backs. We have the momentum'Similar numbers greeted pollsters in New Hampshire, where Trump did well. But the past three days in South Carolina were dominated by stories about a conflict between The Donald and Pope Francis, who told a reporter that he was 'not a Christian' because of his desire to wall off America's southern border.Trump called the Pontiff's comments 'disgraceful' but later said the episode was overblown in early media reports. Out West, Hillary Clinton pulled out a crucial win over Bernie Sanders in Nevada's Democratic caucuses, easing the rising anxieties of her backers. At a raucous victory rally in Las Vegas, she lavished praise on her supporters and declared, 'This one is for you'.Clinton has emerged as a favorite of those seeking an experienced political hand, while Sanders is attracting young voters and others drawn to his call of a political and economic revolution.The Nevada results highlighted Clinton's strength with black voters, a crucial Democratic electorate in the next contest in South Carolina, as well as several Super Tuesday states. The Hispanic vote was closely divided between Sanders and Clinton.According to the entrance polls, Clinton was backed by a majority of women, college-educated voters, those with annual incomes over $100,000, moderates, voters aged 45 and older and non-white voters. Sanders did best with men, voters under 45 and those less affluent and educated.The former secretary of state captured the backing of voters who said electability and experience were important. But in a continuing sign of her vulnerability, Sanders did best with voters looking for a candidate who is caring and honest.Sanders congratulated Clinton on her victory, but then declared that 'the wind is at our backs. We have the momentum'. With a vast network of small donors, Sanders has the financial resources to stay in the race for months.Clinton's win means she will pick up at least 19 of Nevada's 35 delegates. She already holds a sizeable lead in the delegate count based largely on her support from superdelegates - the party leaders who can support the candidate of their choice, no matter the primaries and caucuses.
