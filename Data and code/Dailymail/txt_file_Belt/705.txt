   A bemused Hamilton was left admitting he had removed seat-belts to celebrate wins on more than once occasion, before questioning Grosjean on why he needed clarification on the matter.The world championship leader used the subject over the safety of seat-belts to tease Sebastian Vettel, who he leads by 59 points in the drivers' standings.After his title rival's bizarre collision with Lance Stroll on the slow-down lap following the Malaysian Grand Prix, Hamilton insisted that driving so slowly there wasn't a need to keep the seat-belts on 'unless you're Sebastian' - drawing a ripple of laughter from all the other drivers in attendance.         Hamilton used the question over seatbelts to tease title rival Sebastian Vettel         Vettel (centre) produced a wry smile following Hamilton's quip that he should always be wearing a seatbelt following the German's clash with Lance Stroll after the Malaysian GP         All 20 of the race drivers attended the pre-race drivers briefing held before the Japanese GPHamilton also used the briefing to question Whiting over the Ferrari star taking his steering wheel with him away from the Ferrari following the Stroll collision.The race director stated that drivers are advised to leave steering wheels inside the car to aid marshalls in moving them, but with Vettel's car was so badly damaged there was no need to in that instance. JAPAN PRE-RACE BRIEFING Grosjean: 'After the chequered flag are we allowed to undo the belts?'Whiting: 'No. Any further?'Grosjean: 'Well I think Lewis has been doing it quite a lot.'Whiting: 'Loosening them is reasonable, rather than taking them off completely.'Grosjean: 'I'm just asking, I think it's great for the fans, but I wanted to mention it.'Whiting: 'At the speeds Lewis was driving at, I think that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Loosen them, not undo them.'Felipe Massa: 'But you cannot loosen them. It's very difficult, you need to take it off.'Whiting: 'I was asked a question and I said, no, you should not undo them, but if you can loosen them off, I don't see a big issue with that. Lewis, what do you do, do you loosen them or undo them?'Hamilton: 'Undo them. I don't do it very often. Montreal I did, a few other races.'Whiting: 'You might have started something here Romain...'Grosjean: 'I think it's great for the fans to see a bit more of the driver. But I just wanted to get a clarification.'Hamilton: 'Why would you need clarification on it?'Grosjean: 'Because sometimes you don't put the steering wheel back on and you can get a fine, and it doesn't make sense if the wheels are completely off of the car. So I just wanted to know.'Hamilton: 'Interesting...'Whiting: 'We can clarify it if you really think it's worth it...'Hamilton: 'We're driving so slowly, man. But, I mean, maybe Sebastian should keep his on.'Sebastian Vettel: 'Steering wheel or belts? I'm confused now.'Whiting: 'That is something we've seen happen, isn't it [referring to Vettel's Sepang crash with Lance Stroll]? Needn't have but it did and something similar could happen.'Grosjean: 'I don't want to start an argument or whatever, I just want to know the rules, simple as that.'Whiting: 'Well I don't think you should undo your belts. I think we've see what can happen on a slowing-down lap, so I think it's a very bad practice to undo your belts.'Hamilton: 'I've only done it when I win to wave to fans.'Whiting: 'I understand, yes.'Hamilton: 'But I do slow down massively.'
