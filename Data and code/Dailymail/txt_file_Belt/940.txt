Inactive volcano spotted on largest object in asteroid belt By Associated Press   Published: 19:53 BST, 1 September 2016  |  Updated: 19:53 BST, 1 September 2016                e-mail         LOS ANGELES (AP) — A NASA spacecraft has spied what appears to be an inactive volcano on the surface of Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.The volcano is about half as tall as Mount Everest and likely last erupted several hundred million years ago, scientists reported Thursday."It's totally cool and unexpected," said chief scientist Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles.

Scientists said the volcano on the dwarf planet Ceres is about half as tall as Mount Everest.

Dwarf planets are similar in shape to planets, but they share the same celestial neighborhood with other, similar-sized bodies. Ceres was once considered a planet before it was downgraded to an asteroid. Since 2006, Ceres has been classified as a dwarf planet like Pluto, the former ninth planet.Ceres is the second and last stop for Dawn, which paid an earlier visit to the asteroid Vesta. Both bodies are in the asteroid belt that's littered with rocky debris from the formation of the sun and planets some 4½ billion years ago.Dawn wrapped up its prime mission in June, flying as close as 240 miles above Ceres' surface. NASA approved a mission extension, but engineers need to move the spacecraft higher to save fuel. Dawn on Friday will begin spiraling away until it reaches 910 miles above Ceres to begin a fresh round of observations.___Follow Alicia Chang on Twitter: @SciWriAlicia
