Lucas Browne, the first Australian ever to win a world heavyweight title, is denying using drugs following a positive dope test which threatens him with being stripped of his belt.Ricky Hatton, the Manchester Hitman who is now Browne's promoter, is launching an investigation into how the performance-enhancing drug Clenbuterol was found in his fighter's system following his upset victory over WBA 'regular' champion Ruslan Chagaev in Chechnya earlier this month.David Haye's hopes of challenging the 36-year-old from Sydney for that title, in his second come-back fight at London's 02 Arena in May, are almost certainly dead.         Australian boxer Lucas Browne has denied using drugs despite testing positive earlier this month         Performance-enhancing drug Clenbuterol was found in Browne's system after he defeated Ruslan Chagaev         Browne (left) insists he 'will be fighting for as long as it takes' to clear his name following the positive testBrowne reacted with 'shock and devastation' when informed by a US laboratory that he had failed the test and added: 'I am not a drugs cheat. Prior to this I had not heard of Clenbuterol and I will be fighting for as long as it takes to clear my name.'Both Browne and Hatton appear to suspect foul play in deepest Chechnya.Hatton Promotions issued a statement saying: 'We believe strongly that boxing should be free from performance-enhancing drugs. However we believe Lucas to be a clean athlete who arrived in Chechnya a clean athlete.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 2 Next       Anthony Joshua admits he'd be behind bars if it wasn't for...

   'We are therefore conducting our own further investigations.'Browne added: 'We were well aware of the many risks involved in going to a place like Chechnya to fight a reigning champion and believed we had taken sufficient precautions. It was at our insistence that VADA testing was implemented for this fight.'Browne went into the fight against Chagaev a heavy under-dog. He came bravely through a beating by the Uzbek before knocking him out with a huge right-hook in the 10th round.         Browne's promoter Ricky Hatton appears to suspect foul play in Chechnya and is launching an investigation  WHAT IS CLENBUTEROL?    Clenbuterol is a stimulant drug that increases aerobic capacity and helps speed up the rate that body fat is metabolized.It is sometimes used in the treatment of horses and to increase production of lean meat in cattle.Although approved in some countries for use by asthma patients, it is on the World Anti-Doping Agency banned list for athletes.WADA say: 'Clenbuterol is a prohibited substance and there is no threshold under which this substance is not prohibited'.The drug has also reportedly been used by celebrities such as Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan due to its alleged weight-loss properties.Tour de France champion Alberto Contador was stripped of his 2010 title after testing positive for Clenbuterol.Aussie cyclist Michael Rogers was suspended in 2013 for taking the drug although the sport's governing body, the UCI, accepted his claim that he had eaten contaminated meat.Cronulla Sharks forward Reni Maitua returned a positive test for Clenbuterol in 2009 and was banned for two years, with Manly's Under-20 player Shane Gray handed the same punishment for the same offence.He now faces a much more difficult battle to over-turn his A-sample finding.Clenbuterol, although a weight-loss drug of choice for many celebrities, increases aerobic capacity and the World Anti-Doping Authority says: 'There is no threshold under which Clenbuterol is not prohibited.'Spanish cyclist Alberto Contador was stripped of his 2010 Tour de France victory after testing positive for this drug.There is hardly any incidence of an athlete being cleared of using Clenbuterol by the testing of a B-sample.Australia are among the few national sports associations who have accepted an unknowing ingestion of contaminated meat as an excuse but Browne is being judged in America, not in his homeland nor even in the UK.Hatton will be as devastated as Browne by the findings. He has invested much time and money in bringing the Aussie to his gym near Manchester and transforming him into a world title contender late in his career.Haye saw an opportunity for a shortcut back to another world title challenge following Browne's shock win over Chagaev and has made a substantial offer to fight him, seemingly in vain.The Hayemaker hoped that would lead to a massive, big-money world title unification fight with Anthony Joshua, who challenges American Charles Martin for the IBF belt at the 02 on April 9.There is no suggestion Chagaev or his promoters are under suspicion.
