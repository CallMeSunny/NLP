 San Francisco Giants first baseman Brandon Belt got a call from Major League Baseball's chief baseball officer Joe Torre this week to discuss critical comments Belt made with regard to plate umpire Doug Eddings on Wednesday, manager Bruce Bochy told reporters Friday. After being called out on strikes to end Wednesday night's 6-3 loss to the Cincinnati Reds, Belt told reporters Eddings called the strike in an effort to end the game early. "It's tough, because you hope that an umpire doesn't affect a game like that. But he did, and I'm not sure if it was on purpose either," Belt said. "You've heard that guy multiple times insinuate he's trying to get through the game fast. And then he makes calls like that that I can't imagine that he really thought was a strike. You've got to wonder." Bochy said the Giants don't anticipate that Belt will face any sort for discipline for his remarks. "You're going to have times during the year where it's frustrating," Bochy said. "With what's happened the last couple of days, it's part of the game to deal with. They're human. It is frustrating. But you address it with the best person to talk to." Bochy was ejected from the Giants' extra-inning loss to the Colorado Rockies on Thursday for arguing a strike call with umpire Chris Segal. "They're going to make some mistakes just like we're going to make some," Bochy said of umpires. "Let's just hope it balances out." Belt, out of the Giants' lineup Friday with a swollen knee, has hit .305 with 10 home runs and 25 RBIs this season. He has homered in his last four games. --Field Level Media
