I'm going to give it and make sure that it stays someplace in Brazil as my gift.' Ronda actually visited the same facility last September to lead the children who train there for a session, and in March she made a generous $30,000 donation to the sporting school.Whether she'd already had her heart set on the judo school as the best home for her belt before her fight is unclear, but Ronda has certainly been taking in the sights at a lot of special places in the country this week. On Monday, she visited the famous Christ the Redeemer statute, donning a pair of distressed denim shorts and a blue printed halter, which was open in the back to reveal a lacy black bra underneath.Out exploring the South American capital with her family, Ronda posed for plenty of pictures. She even obliged fans who recognized her, smiling for their cameras as well.          Entertaining the crowds: The sportswoman looked animated as she spoke to the group of young athletes that had gathered to meet her         Supporting other athletes: The judo school is owned by Olympic bronze medalist Flavio Canto         Say cheese: Ronda wore a black tank top that flaunted her muscles, along with an asymmetrical skirt       The California native looked totally carefree and confident as she pushed her wavy blonde hair back with a pair of Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses, flashing a thousand-watt smile for fans and paparazzi alike. It's unsurprising that Ronda has been in such a good mood, as the reigning bantamweight champ defeated opponent Beth Correia in just 34 seconds in their Rio de Janeiro fight on Saturday night, retaining her championship title in the process.She also came off a winner in another smackdown, taking down haters who've criticized her 'masculine' physique on a recent episode of the vlog series UFC 190 Embedded.          Strike a pose! Ronda paused to take several pictures with some of the students at the school, who all looked thrilled about her visit         Family ties: Ronda took one last chance to wave at the the cameras before she and her mother AnnMaria headed home         What an evening: The UFC champion looked as though she had had the time of her life at the event'Ronda Rousey is disgustingly manly how can people find her attractive? [sic]' one man on Twitter wrote recently, while another added: 'Ronda Rousey has it wrong, it's not her body that's too masculine (although it is kinda) it's her face [sic].' Someone else noted: 'Ronda Rousey is not attractive to me I don't see what some of yall dudes see in her she look straight manly to me. [sic]' So Ronda fired back, insisting that a woman using her body for something besides sex isn't 'masculine' - it's 'bad**s'.'Listen, just because my body was developed for a purpose other than f***ing millionaires doesn’t mean it’s masculine,' she said.                      Playing tourist: On Monday, Ronda went sightseeing with her family, flashing her lacy black bra in a backless blue top         Speaking out: The 28-year-old California native recently hit back at haters who called her masculine online         So friendly: Ronda posed for pictures in front of Brazil's Christ the Redeemer statue, and even stopped to smile for fans who wanted a photo'I think it’s femininely bad**s as f**k  because there’s not a single muscle on my body that isn’t for a purpose because I’m not a do nothing b***h.'  She went on: 'It’s not very eloquently said, but it’s to the point and maybe that’s just what I am. I’m not that eloquent, but I’m to the point.'Ronda explained in the clip that she has a term for the kind of woman her mother raised her not to be, a 'do nothing b***h or a DNB for short'.  '[A DNB is] the kind of chick that tries to be pretty and be taken care of by someone else,' she said. That's why I think it's hilarious if people say that my body looks masculine or something like that.'         Not right: For weeks leading up to Ronda's UFC fight, people on social media criticized her appearance         Harsh words: This woman said Ronda is 'far too masculine' to be considered 'even remotely pretty'       Feminine physique: On Sunday, Ronda showed off her fit figure in a crop top during a soccer match       While she didn't let her critics get the last word in, Ronda also isn't exactly wallowing after responding to their negativity. The tough blonde took to Twitter herself yesterday to happily announce that her autobiography, My Fight/Your Fight, is set to be made into a biopic. 'Can't wait to work with Paramount, the talented [writer and executive producer] Mark Bomback and [producer] Mary Parent!' she wrote that same day on Instagram.
