The grief-stricken father of Ashley Olsen – the 35-year-old American woman found strangled to death in Florence, Italy – has spoken for the first time of his ordeal.Walter Olsen, an art professor in the same city who lives round the corner from his daughter's apartment, called her 'beautiful and creative' and said he had faith in the murder investigation.He spoke out as police sources said they were confident that the seedy nightclub where she was last seen by her friends was the key to finding her murderer, who an autopsy found used a belt or rope to kill her. There was no evidence of a struggle, prosecutors said. Detectives have also cleared entirely her boyfriend, Italian-American artist Federico Fiorentini, 42, has a watertight alibi, and confirmed that he is not a suspect.SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO          Victim: Ashley Olsen, 35, was found dead in her flat in Florence, Italy on Saturday by her boyfriend, an Italian artist. He has been entirely cleared by police. Sources said he had a watertight alibi         Speaking out: Walter Olsen, pictured in Florence, said: 'She was a beautiful and creative young woman with a happy, exuberant and generous soul. We are heartbroken that she was taken from us.'         Couple: Federico Fiorentini (left) and Ashley Olsen (right) were together for seven years. Police say he is not a suspect. He found her body and tried to revive her with CPR. 'We are devastated that our precious Ashley has passed away resulting from a horrible and senseless crime,' he said.'She was a beautiful and creative young woman with a happy, exuberant and generous soul, and she loved her life in Florence, in San Frediano.'We are heartbroken that she was taken from us.'After making an appeal for his privacy to be respected, he added: 'We have faith that the perpetrator will be found and sentenced. We thank everyone for their loving thoughts and prayers.'Olsen  - who is a professor of architecture, design and drawing at Bianca Cappello Art Academy in the city - has not been seen in public since Monday.That day he laid a bouquet of flowers outside his daughter's apartment flanked by police officers and officials from the American consulate in Florence.He bowed his head and stood for a few minutes in silence before placing the flowers on her doorstep.For the past few days he has been enduring an agonising wait for his daughter's autopsy to be over so that he can 'hug [his] daughter one last time'.The victim's mother, who is being supported by family and close friends in the United States, is delaying her flight to Florence until she is allowed to see her daughter's body. She too is beside herself with grief.The investigation into the murder is now firmly concentrated in one direction. Detectives have narrowed the investigation down to a single primary 'trail', a police source said tonight.According to investigators' leading hypothesis, Olsen met her killer after her friends left her alone at the notorious Monte Carla club.Officers are paying special attention to the club, the source said, taking into consideration the establishment's reputation and the clientele it attracts.           The 35-year-old was last seen alive at the Montecarla club, an insalubrious members-only establishment           On Thursday night, Olsen headed there after an evening of hard drinking in various bars in Oltre Arno           The club has reclining areas that are almost like beds, strewn with leopard-print cushions and velour drapesThe club has been shut down several times by police for drugs offences, and is a known hotbed of sex, substance abuse and violence.Police believe that Olsen left the club alone at dawn on Friday following an argument with her friends, and that she met her killer either at the club or on her way home.CCTV footage from cameras placed in a nearby piazza and around Olsen's apartment appear to support this theory, and it is being closely examined by investigators – though a suspect has yet to emerge.Investigators described the scene of the crime as 'mayhem', but insisted that this did not indicate a struggle.A broken chair was found in the apartment, they said, but this was the result of Fiorentini's manic attempts to resuscitate his girlfriend rather than violence between Olsen and her killer.Tonight her best friends also released a moving tribute to the victim.'We are bereft and numbed by what has happened,' the statement reads. 'This is horrific and unimaginable… Our thoughts and love go to Ashley's father, mother, and sister, and to all of her family.'

 The victim's boyfriend is being comforted by his mother and sister, who both live in the city.  According to a local café owner who has known Fiorentini since he was a child, this was his second relationship with an American woman.The first had ended amid so much heartache that Fiorentini had been left with emotional scars.'He is a fragile person and suffers a lot inside,' the café owner told Daily Mail Online. 'The experience made the argument he had with Ashley much worse.'Friends of the couple describe Fiorentini as a withdrawn, introverted figure, devoted to his cat and to his art but uncomfortable in social situations.One woman who hosted a New Year's Eve party for 300 people which both Olsen and Fiorentini attended, described him as having 'a blank face'.'I have known him for years and I've never seen him smile,' she said.On Saturday, concerned by the fact that Olsen had not been seen for days, Fiorentini persuaded her landlord to open the door to her chic apartment.There he found her dead on her bed – which was raised on a mezzanine level – wearing nothing but her socks. Her beloved pet dog, Scout, was in a state of great distress, surrounded by his own faeces and urine.Fiorentini panicked, lifting Olsen's body down onto the floor and desperately applying CPR. As he later explained to police, in the process he sustained scratches to his knuckles.He telephoned an ambulance, and police were alerted.'I thought I might be able to save her,' he told friends. 'I loved Ashley and I will absolutely find who killed her. They will pay for what they did.'Today, the prosecutor in charge of the investigation, Giuseppe Creazzo, revealed that Olsen had been strangled with a cord-like implement.           The victim's beloved dog, Scout,  was present when she was murdered and was found in great distress, surrounded by his own urine and feces, when the body was discovered           Key to investigation: The Montecarla club 'is a place where you can find anything you are looking for, sex, drugs, transexuals,' said a woman in a nearby bar           The dimly-lit club, which spans two floors and is open only to members and those known to the proprietorPolice removed both a USB cable and a chain necklace from the murder scene for examination.Fiorentini was interrogated for 10 hours overnight before being released without charge. He emerged from the police station accompanied by his mother, and has not been seen in public since.Some friends believe that the couple's heated argument may have prompted Olsen to go to Monte Carla, a notorious nightclub with a reputation for drug dealing, bar brawls and loose sex, in the small hours of Friday morning.It was here that she was last seen alive, and police suspect that it could have been here or on her way home that she met her killer.A 25-year-old local graphics designer, who did not want to be named, described the Monte Carla as 'not the sort of place you would go alone'.'The unspoken rule is that you have to be in groups of five or six to be safe,' she told Daily Mail Online.'It's the sort of place where you don't ask any questions. You just have vague, drugged-out conversions but you never go any further, as you never know what sort of person you'll get involved with.'If you're looking for trouble, that's the place to find it.'The dimly-lit, all-night club, which is owned by Serbian Jovo Vukelic, is an insalubrious members-only establishment with leopard-print cushions, velour drapes and leather-clad waitresses.It is a known sex and drugs den where Albanian drug pushers have operated.The club has been closed by police at least three times, and investigated repeatedly by narcotics officers.                  Investigators said the woman's friends told them they were together with Olsen at the Florence nightspot                  Forensic teams have been searching for clues left by the killer in the club, along the streets that lead to her apartment, inside her home and on her body           An autopsy is being carried out, but medics have already established that Olsen was strangledPolice have found cocaine and rolled-up banknotes in the club, and have been called to deal with mass brawls and allegations of sexual abuse in the lavatory.It was in this seedy environment that Olsen – who had a reputation as a party animal – was last seen.She arrived at the club with a group of friends, but when they left she decided to stay behind. Two days later, her body was found at her apartment by her boyfriend.'She would never normally have cheated on her boyfriend, but perhaps she decided to do it because of their argument, a friend told Daily Mail Online. Officers requested the CCTV footage from the camera at the entrance to the Monte Carla, but the Serbian owner said that it hadn't worked for years.The victim's mobile phone vanished and is thought to have been taken by the killer, and painstaking searches through CCTV of the area have so far proven fruitless.Much rides on the full results of the autopsy, expected in the next few days, which will establish whether Olsen had sex before she was killed, and whether she had alcohol and drugs in her system.The police investigation is being led by Domenico Giancinto Profazio, the same officer who led the long-running and controversial investigation into the murder of Meredith Kercher, the British exchange student killed in Perugia in 2007.That resulted in first the conviction, then ultimately, at the end of a long-running series of appeals, the acquittal of American student Amanda Knox.                Amanda Knox, left, and Knox's then-boyfriend were at first convicted of the Meredith Kercher's murder, acquitted, convicted again on appeal and finally acquitted. Kercher is pictured right           Domenico Giancinto Profazio lead the Meredith Kercher murder inquiry and is now in charge of the probe into the death of Ashley Ann OlsenShe continues to protest her innocence, but the case divided opinion in Italy, the United States and the United Kingdom.The office of the prosecutor in charge of the investigation, Giuseppe Creazzo, said that Olsen had apparently opened the door to her killer, as police did not find any sign of forced entry.The police also confirmed that the killer took Olsen's mobile phone, making the subsequent investigation more difficult.A black bra was found in the street outside the scene of the crime, and was removed by police.Italian prosecutors have opened a murder investigation. The detective in charge of the murder inquiry, Giancinto Profazio, is the same officer who led the investigation into the death of British exchange student Meredith Kercher.That has stoked fears among locals in Italy that the case could end up like a drawn-out legal saga like that of the high-profile murder case of Kercher.It resulted in the conviction, then ultimately acquittal of her housemate Amanda Knox, a student from Seattle, in a saga which divided opinion in Italy, the US, and the UK.
