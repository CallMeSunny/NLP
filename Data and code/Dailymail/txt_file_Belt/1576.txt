He has had a crash and should be investigated, charged if necessary and prosecuted.'Norfolk's former roads policing chief, Chris Spinks, said there could be no favouritism, adding: 'He will be dealt with like any other driver.' Royal sources yesterday said the elderly royal, who is still at Sandringham, was in 'deep shock' over the incident.         Motoring experts said it was likely police would ask Philip (pictured at the wheel near Balmoral last year) to voluntarily surrender his driver's licence because of his ageFamily members, including Prince Charles, were 'worried' for all parties involved.
