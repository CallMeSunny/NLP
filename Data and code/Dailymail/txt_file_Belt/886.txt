Child with explosives caused Damascus blast: Syria media By Afp   Published: 16:15 BST, 16 December 2016  |  Updated: 16:16 BST, 16 December 2016                e-mail        5 shares    A blast that rocked a police station in southeast Damascus on Friday was caused by a seven-year-old girl carrying a belt of explosives, Syrian media reported.The explosion in the bustling Midan neighbourhood of the Syrian capital wounded three police officers, said the Al-Watan daily, which is close to the government."A seven-year-old girl entered the police station, carrying a belt that was detonated from afar," the paper posted on its Facebook page.
