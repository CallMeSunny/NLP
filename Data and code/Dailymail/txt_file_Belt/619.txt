With 38 books under his belt, it is hard to believe ‘the people’s scientist’ Dr Karl Kruszelnicki still doesn't consider himself an expert in anything.The vibrant 67-year-old would simply tell you he is on the ‘path to enlightenment’, hoping to shed some light on as many of life’s mystery’s as possible in the process.The good doctor, whose voice you may recognise from Triple j Mornings, consumes a one metre high stack of scientific literature each month and with 28 years and more than $100,000 worth of ‘publicly funded’ education, Dr Karl clearly has an unquenchable thirst for knowledge.Scroll down for video          Dr Karl Kruszelnicki is on the ‘path to enlightenment’, hoping to shed some light on as many of life’s mystery’s as possible in the processIf given the chance, the inquisitive scientist could rattle off an endless multitude of facts, some of which he has included in his most recent book Short Back and Science, which was released on Tuesday.For instance, Dr Karl has researched a particularly interesting group of scientists who willingly expose themselves to the harsh Antarctic conditions so they are able to run around the South Pole - completely in the nude.

 ‘Members of the 300 Club sit in an extremely hot sauna before they chuck on a pair on insulated boots, towel off their sweat and proceed out of the building, into the darkness,' he told Daily Mail Australia.‘If they have a healthy heart they will be able to slowly trot around the south pole and back again.’         If given the chance, the inquisitive scientist could rattle off an endless multitude of facts, some of which he has included in his most recent book Short Back and Science, which was released on Tuesday         Dr Karl has researched a particularly interesting group of people who willingly expose themselves to the harsh Antarctic conditions so they can run around the South Pole - completely in the nudeSlowly being the operable word - Dr Karl said he knew a ‘slightly cocky’ man who once picked up the pace as he navigated the icy conditions and ended up with painful windburn to the back of his throat.To gain entry to the elusive club, temperatures outside must be below -73.3°C and that means that members of the club cannot wear clothing during the ‘brutal’ task. Dr Karl said if there is any liquid or sweat soaked into the fabric of your clothing, sharp shards of ice capable of cutting into your flesh would form as soon as you braved the sub-zero temperatures.‘There were people who did it in their underwear and you can only imagine the ice slicing into their underpant region,’ Dr Karl told Daily Mail Australia. While the animated scientist usually deals in cold hard facts, 'what if's' are his bread and butter.          Dr Karl said he knew a ‘slightly cocky’ man who once picked up the pace as he navigated the icy conditions and ended up with painful windburn to the back of his throat         While the animated scientist usually deals in cold hard facts, 'what if's' are his bread and butterDuring his widespread research, Dr Karl managed to calculate how long it would take to get it to the other side of the globe, if one was able to travel through a giant hole in the middle of the earth.‘The answer to this question used to be that you would pop out on the other side of the Earth 42 minutes and 11 seconds later.But a bit of fact finding and fine-tuning now tells us that it would be close to 38 minutes and 11 seconds,’ he said.Dr Karl will also tell you that the human race has already made monumental changes to our home planet.         During his wide-spread research, Dr Karl managed to calculate how long it would take to get it to the other side of the globe, if one was able to travel through a giant hole in the middle of the earthThe doctor, known for his animated approach to all things science, said human beings are responsible for shifting the world's axis. ‘The rapid melting of ice on land has made the drift velocity of the North Pole accelerate, and has changed its direction to the east.’‘We are talking about six or seven centimetres, not kilometres, but we humans have actually tipped the earth off its axis,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.Back on the surface of the Earth, Dr Karl has found that around one quarter for the world’s surface is susceptible to sink holes - where a large portion of underground rock is shifted or dissolved by water over hundreds of years and and eventually collapses.         Back on the surface of the Earth, Dr Karl has found that around one quarter for the world’s surface is amenable to sink holes         A sink hole occurs when a large portion of underground rock is shifted or dissolved by water over hundreds of years, eventually exposing enormous holes that have been known to stretch almost a kilometre wide         The 67-year-old said the earth’s surface isn’t the only thing crumbling away, one of Australia’s most recognisable landmarks are also at risk of losing its most vibrant marine life       ‘In Florida around 40 per cent of the state is amenable to sinkholes, while in Australia the area’s most at risk are around Perth or the Nullarbor plains.’The 67-year-old said the earth’s surface isn’t the only thing crumbling away, with one of Australia’s most recognisable landmarks at risk of losing its most vibrant marine life.‘People keep saying there is nothing wrong with the Great Barrier Reef but it has already lost around 50 per cent of its coral, with another 25 per cent expected to be gone by 2222.’Interestingly, while the degradation of the reef has taken place over around 30 years, Dr Karl said there are much more powerful forces at play. According to his research, there is a naturally occurring virus called called bacteria pharges that is capable of consuming half the world’s bacteria in only two days.          ‘People keep saying there is nothing wrong with the Great Barrier Reef but it has already lost around 50 per cent of its coral, with another 25 per cent expected to be gone by 2222,’ Dr Karl said         An unrecognisable Dr Karl can be seen sporting a head of long grey hair back in 1991         While one would assume Dr Karl's wealth of knowledge is a result of his tertiary education, he claims his varied employment history - which includes working at the steelworks(pictured) - helped him understand much larger concepts         Before his days as a well known science personality, Dr Karl claims he was the first hippie in Wollongong (pictured in 1971)While one would assume Dr Karl's wealth of knowledge is a result of his tertiary education, he claims his varied employment history - which includes working as a labourer, physicist, tutor, film-maker, car mechanic, TV weatherman, engineer, a mathematician and a doctor - helped him understand much larger concepts. 'Physics gave me a mental tool box, engineering taught me how things work, being a labourer gave me a concept of what is happening in the real world while as a doctor I was presented with a huge body of knowledge,' he said.In his most recent book, Short Back and Science, Dr Karl also touches on why mole rats don't get cancer, how a toilet seat helped end the First World War, if bananas are really slippery and what clouds weigh.For more cutting-edge scientific snippets from Dr Karl Kruszelnicki his newest book Short Back and Science is now available in stores.
