And you tell me what he says, right.'Peskov: 'Sure.'Elton; 'Yes please.'Vladimir Krassnov, posing as Putin [in Russian]: 'Hello Sir Elton. I was told that you wanted to discuss some important issues of Russian life.'Elton: 'That is incredible. I am a musician and a philanthropic person and a humanitarian.
