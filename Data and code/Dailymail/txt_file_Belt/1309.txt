Temperley London's collections have been awash with glittering sequins for most seasons now and, just like us, it appears Kate Upton cannot get enough of this shining trend either.
The model was attending the Maxim Hot 100 party with her husband and made sure to show off her baby bump in true statement style. As put together by Jamie Mizrahi, she's wearing a custom multi-coloured sequin dress by the British designer that features a high neck and ombré like pattern. 
A dress just like Kate's is perfect for an evening event when you want to look your best.
