Shocking footage reveals the inhumanity of how chirping chicks are treated on the first day of their lives, processed like meat on an assembly line.The footage shows how weak chick's heads are torn off - while they are still alive - while the more unlucky ones are thrown in black bin liners without even being killed if they are not considered suitable for the meat industry.The video, filmed secretly by an animal rights campaign group, shows them being packed into crates by the thousand and shut in dark cupboards to be stored.                Workers sort through the thousands of birds in an inhumane process that could be equated to quality control in other industrial facotories         The footage shows how weak chick's heads are torn off - while they are still alive - but the more unlucky ones aren't even killed before they are thrown in black bin liners and disposed of         Those that survive to the later stages of the factory line are then dropped onto a carousel and workers then pick them up, stab them with a vaccination needle, then throw them down a hole in the middle within seconds         The crates are and shut in dark cupboards to be stored during the industrial hatching process         The video, filmed secretly by an animal rights group, shows them being packed into crates by the thousandThe tiny animals are poured from boxes onto conveyor belts, where workers throw them from section to section by the handful, tossing them carelessly as though they are inanimate objects.The birds can be seen being shot through chutes onto the next section of the assembly line.Some chicks that hatched late are not even separated from the broken shells.They can be seen being crushed along with the broken egg shells.

 Those that survive to the later stages of the factory line are then dropped onto a carousel, where they pile up.Workers then pick them up, stab them with a vaccination needle, then throw them down a hole in the middle within seconds.The video goes on to highlight how the chicks are sent to industrial growth farms and pumped with growth hormones, growing to full size within just 40 days.Some will grow so fast that their legs cannot keep up, and they become immobilised in the battery farms.         The tiny animals are thrown from section to section by the handful, tossed carelessly as though they are inanimate objects         They are then poured onto the assembly line with little care, as though the live chickens are already meat         The tiny chicks move along the conveyor belt onto an area meant to filter out the broken egg shells, although some of the smaller birds may fall between the cracks         Machines fire the tiny birds down chutes and into crates, while the creatures, which are less than a day old, are left dazed and confused         The industrial process moves the chick from one place to the next in a routine that is far from delicate         The video, by a group called Animal Equality , describes it as 'what the meat industry doesn't want us to see'         The video goes on to highlight how the chicks are sent to industrial growth farms and pumped with growth hormones, growing to full size within just 40 daysThe video, by a group called Animal Equality, describes it as 'what the meat industry doesn't want us to see'.The footage, which has now been viewed more than 30million times, is believed to have been shot in the USA, although practices are similar in Britain. Millions of chicks born on egg farms every year never make it through their first day as they are killed simply for being born male.The chicks, which are useless as they cannot lay eggs, are either gassed or thrown into macerating machines, which kill them instantly.The British Egg Information Service (BEIS) claims that they are 'humanely gassed', and has admitted in the past that this happens whether the eggs are free range or not.
