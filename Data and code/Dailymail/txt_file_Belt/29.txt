 PARIS, March 26 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel described China's "Belt and Road" infrastructure plan on Tuesday as an important project that Europeans wanted to participate in but said it also demanded reciprocity from Beijing. "We, as Europeans, want to play an active part (in the project) and that must lead to a certain reciprocity and we are still wrangling over that a bit," said Merkel after talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, Chinese President Xi Jingping and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
