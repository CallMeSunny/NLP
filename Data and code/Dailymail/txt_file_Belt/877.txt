Robert Whittaker overcame Yoel Romero in an epic five-round fight to claim the middleweight interim title          Whittaker improved as the fight wore on and his superior conditioning helped him land with more frequency         Michael Bisping (left) came into the octagon and threw down the gauntlet to Whittaker ahead of their title fight          Crucially Whittaker earned the takedown in the final round to put any doubts in the judge's minds to bed          Whittaker took some punishment from Romero but came through adversity like a champion in the end 'First of all, Robert, that was an awesome fight,' said Bisping, speaking to Whittaker after his big win.'Romero, well done. I wanted to come in here and talk a lot of s***, but it was an awesome fight.'The fact that you're standing there with a f****** belt on like you're a champion makes me sick. You should be ashamed of yourself.'Here, take that,' said the Englishman, before he threw his own title on the canvas.         Romero had the better of the early rounds but the Australian soon found his range and landed heavy strikes         When Romero tried to close the distance, Whittaker employed the use of the push kick to the midriffThat's one hell of a main event! #UFC213 pic.twitter.com/xLjmiGqxGn— UFC (@ufc) July 9, 2017  Romero shoots, gets Whittaker down, but Whittaker pops right back up and gets out of it! #UFC213 pic.twitter.com/mZeEVJxWXG— UFC (@ufc) July 9, 2017  'Fight me soon for it. I'll see you soon, m*****f*****.'After suffering the injury in the first round, Romero took down Whittaker inside the first minute of the second round and marshalled the action with side control.However, Whittaker managed to put the Cuban on the back foot for the remaining three rounds, significantly out striking his opponent.Earlier, the crowd in the T-Mobile Arena voiced their concern when Alistair Overeem was announced as the winner of his heavyweight bout with Fabricio Werdum after three rounds.

          Alistair Overeem earned a controversial decision victory over old rival Fabricio Werdum in the co main event          Overeem had the better of the opening two rounds but was out performed in the third round decisively NOT SO FAST @FabricioWerdum#UFC213 pic.twitter.com/MaDfilQKbm— UFC (@ufc) July 9, 2017  A trilogy fight, Overeem took his second win out of three contests with the Brazilian. He may have positioned himself to take another shot at heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic after sealing the victory.Many thought that Werdum had done enough to secure the win after claiming a dominant third round. Both the first and second rounds were very close, but Overeem did enough to have an argument for getting the nod in both.Curtis Blaydes just about passed his litmus test against Polish veteran Daniel Omielańczuk after a tentative three rounds, taking a win by unanimous decision.The stout build of Omielanczuk didn't allow Blaydes much success in the wrestling department, and often the American was punished when he stood in the pocket.         Curtis Blaydes overcame Daniel Omielanczuk in a tepid heavyweight affair earlier in the evening          Blades had his hand raised by referee Marc Goddard but was not particularly satisfied with his performance At just 26-years-old, Blaydes could achieve big things in the sport, but he certainly didn't secure the coming-of-age performance he was hoping for against Omielańczuk.A far more confident version of Anthony Pettis traded highlight reel worthy kicks with lightweight stalwart Jim Miller in the closing seconds of their bout, which ended in the favour of 'Showtime'.Returning to the lightweight bracket since his defeat to featherweight champ Max Holloway, Pettis displayed some of his spectacular striking arsenal with spinning back fists, flying knees and various other high-risk techniques over the three rounds.         Anthony Pettis looked back to his best in the lightweight division with victory over Jim Miller by unanimous decision         Pettis sturck with cleaner shots but Miller was typically game and put up a solid resistance against 'Showtime'His ability to out wrestle highly regarded grappler Miller in the second round was particularly impressive, given that Pettis has always been predominantly acclaimed for his striking acumen.To open the main card, Rob Font scored a second round submission win over Douglas Silva de Andrade when he secured a slick guillotine choke after administrating a striking clinic on the Brazilian in the first round of their bantamweight meeting.With just one loss in twenty-five tests ahead of their clash, Andrade represents the biggest scalp on Font's record to date.          Rob Font claimed an impressive victory to kick off the main card of action in T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Amanda Nunes pulls out of UFC 213 with illness as main event...
