Kat Graham made the sidewalk look like a catwalk as she stepped out in LA wearing a designer ensemble!
Styled by Jennifer Mazur, Kat donned a striped dress/trench hybrid by Fendi. We love the military style gold buttons, asymmetric design and bold stripes. 
Although you could rock this as a traditional trench, Kat was wearing it by itself, teamed simply with some towering platforms. It looked like a high fashion take on a shirt dress! 
Sadly it  has now sold out but click right to shop the current collection where there's plenty of gems to be found.
Or why not emulate Kat's look with the help of them edit below? Boohoo, SheIn, Tufi Duek and Mackintosh all have some fab finds that are ideal for channelling Fendi vibes.
