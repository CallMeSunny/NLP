   After cementing his claim for the next big star in the welterweight division, Garcia celebrated in the ring with his new green title belt - and a tiny replica for his 5-month-old daughter, Philly.'I was throwing my combinations, using my legs like my dad told me to do,' he added. 'I knew he was going to come to fight. He's a rugged warrior.'Garcia, in his second fight at 147lb, didn't waste his quick opportunity for a title shot after a championship-winning career at 140 pounds. He beat Khan, Erik Morales, Lucas Matthysse and Lamont Peterson at light-welterweight before moving up a division last August with a ninth-round stoppage of veteran Paulie Malignaggi.          Garcia recovered from a slow start to control the later rounds against Guerrero on Saturday night          Former champion Floyd Mayweather Jnr was at ringside to watch the fight between Garcia and GuerreroGuerrero got off to an impressive start at the Staples Centre but became less mobile and less effective late in his third career loss in a welterweight title fight, following previous defeats against Mayweather and Keith Thurman.The former multi-division champion's career has hit a crossroads with three losses in his last five fights, along with two debatable decision victories.But Guerrero was more aggressive early on, following Garcia around the ring and landing big shots while Garcia backpedaled. Garcia also complained about head-butts, but he gradually gained control of the bout, exploiting Guerrero's lack of head movement and defense.The bout turned after Guerrero rocked Garcia with a straight left to the head in the fifth. Garcia recovered and answered with a series of punishing right hands in the sixth.         Garcia revels in his victory and soaks up the atmosphere with his young daughter Philly in the ring Garcia exerted control from there, but Guerrero occasionally replied before they finished with an all-action 12th round.'Not one person out there thought Danny won, but his team,' Guerrero said. 'I pressured him. I nailed him, busted his body up. I out-jabbed him. The crowd thought I won the fight. I thought I won the fight, and I definitely want a rematch.'Khan, who also the option of fighting British rival Kell Brook this summer, is the No 1 contender and hopes to face Garcia later this year.He tweeted: 'Who wants to see Khan Garcia 2? Mandatory fight 2016.'But Garcia said: 'I don't have to fight nobody. He's been inactive for a year, so I don't think that's a good idea to fight an active fighter, if you're inactive. But I've beat him once, I can beat him again.'    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Tyson Fury vows to 'lay out' Anthony Joshua in the future......
