He may have two Grand Slam titles under his belt, but tennis ace Andy Murray is no match for reality TV stars at Madame Tussauds.I’m told the wax museum has snubbed the dour Scottish sportsman in favour of U.S. model Kendall Jenner, star of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, and clotheshorse Cara Delevingne, whose mannequins were unveiled this year due to huge public demand.Tennis champs Boris Becker and Rafael Nadal are among the 16 waxwork sportsmen on display at Madame Tussauds. But despite his home-grown 2013 Wimbledon men’s singles win, there are no plans for Murray to join them.              He may have two Grand Slam titles under his belt, but tennis ace Andy Murray, right, is no match for reality TV stars such as Kendall Jenner, left, at Madame TussaudsAccording to a museum spokesman, Murray, 29, is simply not popular enough to join the attraction’s hall of fame — unlike YouTube video bloggers Alfie Deyes, 22, and girlfriend Zoe ‘Zoella’ Sugg, 26, who topped last year’s most-requested lists.‘Should guests request that Murray’s figure be included, we would certainly consider it,’ sniffs the source. ‘But for now there are no immediate plans.’   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE: Lady Amelia forges ahead in the royal...

   Why everyone's talking about... Alice Naylor-LeylandFor her 30th birthday earlier this month, fashion blogger Alice Naylor-Leyland dyed the fleeces of a flock of sheep in bright colours.She certainly likes to get noticed. When she was a 17-year-old pupil at St Mary’s School, Wantage, an admirer wrote a song about the bubbly blonde called Alice In Her Palace.That admirer — Tom Naylor-Leyland, grandson of the colourful Lord Lambton — is Alice’s husband of five years, after the couple married in Gloucestershire in 2011.The song he wrote has become the title of Alice’s Instagram account, where she updates her 61,500 followers with pastel-coloured shots of clothes and country living.         For her 30th birthday earlier this month, fashion blogger Alice Naylor-Leyland dyed the fleeces of a flock of sheep in bright coloursBefore her marriage, Alice was a PR girl and fixture on the London party scene. The arrival of her and Tom’s two children — Billy, four, and Nancy, nine months — has done little to change that.When she’s not hosting themed dinner parties for her socialite friends, including Princess Beatrice, Poppy Delevingne and Mary Charteris, Alice pens a fashion blog called Mrs Alice.She also runs the cookery school at the 17th-century Talbot Hotel in Malton, North Yorkshire, which is owned by Tom, 34, and his parents Sir Philip and Lady Isabella.The Naylor-Leylands also own piles in Wales and Cambridgeshire, where they throw wild house parties.It’s a case of Alice in her palaces, these days.  Queen of the urban jungle: leggy Tarzan star takes TubeNever mind the legend of Tarzan. It was Jane’s legs that turned heads in London this week.Actress Margot Robbie, who plays the hero’s love interest in the new Tarzan movie, put on an extremely leggy display as she stepped on to the Tube at Piccadilly Circus.The Aussie star went underground in a pair of black denim hotpants paired with a faded denim shirt and black trainers.              Actress Margot Robbie, left, who plays the hero’s love interest in the new Tarzan movie, put on an extremely leggy display as she stepped on to the Tube at Piccadilly Circus, rightRobbie, 26, may want to keep a low profile after this week’s controversial Vanity Fair profile that called her countrymen ‘throwback people’.The one-time Neighbours actress has also had to bat off rumours of off-screen chemistry with Tarzan co-star Alexander Skarsgard — much to the displeasure of his girlfriend, model Alexa Chung. It’s a jungle out there.  Comedian and self-appointed ‘voice’ of the animals Ricky Gervais has said ‘the only way fox-hunting would count as vermin control is if the posh t***s fell off their horses and broke their necks’.He’s equally bullish about the running of the bulls festival in Pamplona, Spain.When seven people were rushed to hospital yesterday after being gored by bulls, Gervais tweeted: ‘Good. Silly c***s.’Isn’t he full of the milk of human kindness?  A new chapter for David Cameron, as he turns the page on his time in No 10?I can disclose that the outgoing PM’s loyal press aide, Gabby Bertin, has held private talks with J. K. Rowling’s literary agent.In the run-up to the referendum, Bertin breakfasted with Neil Blair whose agency, The Blair Partnership, boasts that it helps people with ‘established careers and platforms’ unlock their ‘creative ambitions’. Cameron is no doubt keen to set the record straight after Lord Ashcroft’s insalubrious unauthorised biography, Call Me Dave.A source tells me Bertin and Blair were catching up as old friends. Well, that’s their story.
