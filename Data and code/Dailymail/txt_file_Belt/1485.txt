Alice and Olivia isn't the hugest name on the New York Fashion Week agenda, but it's certainly one of our favourite shows here at Fashion Finder.
The fall 2016 collection showed a lot of promise as it was shown this week - we loved the bold multicoloured and animal prints contrasted with the ladylike lace and baroque patterns - the whole collection was a treat for the eye in terms of being bright and beautiful. And there to see this gorgeous collection unfold was Nicky Hilton, who of course donned Alice + Olivia for the event - what else?
The heiress looked fabulous in her paisley print number that makes up part of the resort commercial line that is up for grabs now - the season was full of the print!
Nicky finished off the bohemian look with the help of tan sandals and her hair plaited - she looked fabulous and totally ready for the spring season.
