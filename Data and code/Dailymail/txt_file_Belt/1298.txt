   The rematch of DeGale's life was a battle between the matador and the bull. The matador won, even though he was the one who shed all the blood.'I'm back,' screamed DeGale as the unanimous verdict came down. So no premature retirement, as he had threatened should he lose to Truax a second time.It was a close call on the cards of the two judges who gave it to him by a point, 114-113. As did I. The third man gave it to Chunky 117-110.Concerns as to whether a full panel of American officials would favour aggression over skill were allayed by their unprejudiced decision.Truax took much credit, too, by coming through the pain which had him clutching his mouth in agony when DeGale the first two of his many left hooks to the teeth. More was to come from that weapon but he never again flinched as he put DeGale to the test.But even though the blood streamed down DeGale's face from the third round on, he could not land decisively on a target back to being as elusive as he ever was.         DeGale was warned for using his shoulder and he was deducted a point by the referee for the infringement DeGale said: 'I couldn't see through my right eye but I had to keep finding a way to win.' So he did, if was to return to the top table of his division. Huge fights now beckon later this year, probably including at last another rematch, with George Groves.And this wound hurt nothing like match as his damaged pride in their first fight. Many critics thought he was washed up after that defeat and even he wavered in his conviction.But he found the will to resurrect his career, by reminding us that the skills which made him the first British boxer to win Olympic gold and go on to become a world champion are still in fine working order.          DeGale was cut and struggled to see out of his right eye as the champion piled on plenty of pressure Jeff Powell's scorecard  Truax                     Round                  DeGale    9                              1                                 10    9                              2                                10    10                            3                                 9    9                              4                                10    10                            5                                 9     9                             6                                10     9                             7                                10    10                            8                                  9    10                            9                                  9    10                           10                                 8     9                            11                                 10     9                            12                                10   113                         TOTAL                          114   Apparently you can take a nap in one of Elvis Presley's old beds at this Hard Rock. DeGale was more interested in sending Truax to sleep on the ring canvas in an arena trendily called The Joint.This was not the Vegas debut 'Chunky' had envisaged for himself. Off-Strip. Top of the undercard, not the bill. Watched by about 3,500 in a hall built for 5,000. Most of whom had turned out to watch the ensuing world super-welterweight championship unification fight between Erislandy Lara and Jarrett Hurd.But regardless of the surroundings this was one of the most important fights in DeGale's career. Not least because he had suggested it might be his last if it went as badly as the first against Truax.Surely not. Not with DeGale the road warrior back in America, where he won his title against the odds and defender it so valiantly, before his disastrous home-coming in December. For certain, he had been in livelier form through fight week, looked lean and hungry at the weigh-in and came bouncing into The Joint looking eager to retrieve not only his IBF belt but his reputation. Shot, as some thought after the London debacle. We were about to find out. A smattering of English cheers for 'Chunky' were drowned out by the American cat-calls as the first bell rang. DeGale answered them with a crisp succession of jabs with that southpaw right which he admitted had not fully recovered from shoulder surgery in the first fight. Then he landed a vicious left hook which Truax staggering back clutching his mouth in agony.Truax had treatment for his mouth in the first interval but managed to come for the second on the offensive, only for DeGale to inflict replica agony to the teeth. More lefts followed as DeGale refused to let the thick-set Truax bully him as he had done four months earlier.          The former Olympic champion boxed clever and did well considering the damage to his right eye          Truax spoke about his frustration in an inability to let his shots go as well in the rematch compared with the first fight DeGale slipped through the gears of his skills – until he walked onto a big right hook. He took it well but Truax was suitably encouraged and cut DeGale above the right eye with powerful right uppercut.Slow motion TV replays suggested the wound had been caused by a head butt which followed the uppercut. Either way it was a nasty gash and as the blood continued to flow Truax became the aggressor. But the cleaner punches were coming from 'Chunky', notably a couple of crunching lefts to win the round.Truax kept coming forward and DeGale, troubled by the cut played cat and mouse for a while. A doctor was called to examine the cut half a minute before the end of the round but he was allowed to continue a round he narrowly lost to superior work-rate.         Truax was game and after the fight DeGale said the American would give some top level opponents trouble         DeGale showcased his superior boxing skills against the tenacity and marching forward of Truax throughout DeGale was back to his boxing in the sixth and the openings he made for his left edged the round. He was having more trouble holding Truax off now, but he responded by raising his work rate and landing a succession of clean left hooks.DeGale was clearly ahead on my card but with all the judges being American there had to be a concern whether they would favour clumsy aggression. More clever movement and counter-punching were probably not enough to give him the eighth.Truax was doing his best to turn into a wrestling match, preventing DeGale from putting on the dominant performance he had demanded off himself. But while he was by far the superior boxer he let the ninth slip to Truax by lowering his work-rate.For all DeGale's brilliant defensive movement, Truax was still able to get through often enough to bring himself further back into the fight. When the referee deducted a point from DeGale for persistent use of the shoulder as they came into the clinches it was getting too close for comfort.DeGale picked his man off with some cutting edge lefts in the 11th. With the lumbering Truax mostly missing he took a round on my card which he needed. DeGale's face was a mess but his heart was still strong. His late flurry of lefts saw him home in a barn-burner.
