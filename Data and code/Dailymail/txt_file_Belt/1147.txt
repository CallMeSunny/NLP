Ministers are being urged to impose a ban on green belt development until after Britain has left the EU so that housing forecasts can be reduced to reflect lower immigration.Tory MPs fear that, unless ministers agree to 'pause' development now, huge swathes of green belt land could be bulldozed to house EU migrants who will not have the right to come to the UK.Official forecasts suggest 5.3million new homes will be needed in England over the next 25 years, with immigration accounting for 37 per cent of new demand.But, with Theresa May pledging to end free movement, critics say these figures should be reviewed.
