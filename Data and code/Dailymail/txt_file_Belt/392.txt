This is not religion. Let them wear even miniskirts but there must not be any blasts,' he said, according to the BBC.          Kyrgyzstan President Almazbek Atambayev said the country's women had been 'wearing miniskirts since the 1950s, and they never thought about wearing an explosive belt'Mr Atambayev, who is the leader of a country where 80 per cent of the population identify as Muslim, also said donning Islamic dress was not in line with traditional Kyrgyz culture and was a possibly a sign of danger.He said terrorists were 'insane people' and clothes had the potential to 'change one's thoughts'. 'When we were searching for prisoners who had escaped a detention centre, [former interior minister] Melis Turganbayev... said that they had been eavesdropping on telephone conversations of wives and mistresses of criminals,' he said.
