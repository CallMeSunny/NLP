You'd think you would be safe enough sitting in a stationary car, but some things in life are just too bizarre for words. In 2008 Matthew Hill Smith suffered a severe seizure - the first one in his life - while sitting in his parked car. It was so violent the thrashing against the seat belt he was wearing broke his back in three places.A sixth-generation winemaker, and now a successful vigneron thanks to his Marko’s Vineyard property in the Adelaide Hills, the 57-year-old was a hair's breath away from being crippled for life.          Matthew Hill Smith (right) and his 19-year-old daughter Christobel (left) own Marko’s Vineyard in the Adelaide Hills          In 2008 Mr Hill Smith had a severe seizure while in his parked car and broke his back         A keen skier Mr Hill Wood (pictured) suffered a skiing accident in Japan six years ago that lead to his seizure'I was skiing in Japan six years ago when a snowboarder hit me and I was knocked out,' he told Daily Mail Australia.'I got back to Australia and everything appeared OK until I was out driving and I began feeling pretty bad. I pulled the car over. Suddenly I had a massive fit and passed out. While this was happening the seat belt just got tighter and tighter, and I ended up breaking my own back in three places.'Where I was incredibly lucky was that when paramedics got there they were treating me for epilepsy as I wasn't conscious and just had a seizure. They didn't know that I had broken my back and could have severed my spine by moving me.'Even after the shocking episode the hospital later didn't take any X-rays as they thought he was an epileptic.         To celebrate his recovery to full health he sailed his boat (pictured) around the South Pacific           Mr Hill Smith slowly got back to health again thanks to the support of his daughter Christobel 'When the X-rays finally were taken and came back it showed that I'd broken three vertebrae,' he said. But Mr Hill Smith still wasn't out of the woods. The medication the doctors gave him to prevent further seizures had serious side effects that destroyed his liver. As a result, he is now one of Australia’s only teetotal vignerons.It's a cruel irony considering his occupation, but he still retains the ability to 'swill and spit' to taste the vintages.'I had a huge reaction to the epiliepsy drugs and was very, very ill. Getting over my back issue was one thing but having to deal with my liver problems as well was a completely different battle altogether,' the 57-year-old explained.After breaking his back he had four months in hospital and then followed it up with a year of rehab where he learned to walk again. He then spent the next two years building his strength – by walking, riding bikes, gym, and physiotherapy.           As well as sailing the South Pacific Mr Hill Smith circumnavigated Australia in 2014         Skiing was Mr Hill Smith's passion and one day he hopes to do it againFollowing the intensive rehabilitation program, he vowed to live life to the full so he started on a new journey, this time sailing around the South Pacific and circumnavigating Australia in 2014.'When you've been through these kind of health problems you suddenly realise that it's time to start ticking off a few things on the old bucket list,' the 57-year-old told Daily Mail Australia.'Because at that age you don't really think you're terribly old. But when you think you could spend the rest of your life in a wheelchair it changes a few things.'Suddenly I thought "bloody hell Matthew you've dodged a bullet there", so I really did start to appreciate life much more.'  Now, as the owner of Marko’s Vineyard, with his 19-year-old daughter Christobel, Mr Hill Smith says he at least has the right perspective on life these days.          Sailing and fishing are all now part of the 57-year's way of enjoying life after his illness         Being able to get out on his boat (pictured) sailing has helped give him a new perspective on life
