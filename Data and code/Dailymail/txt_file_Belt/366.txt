 With two by-election wins under its belt, the Turnbull government must now focus on the economy to secure the 2019 federal election, junior federal minister Craig Laundy believes. Liberal John Alexander retained his seat on Saturday, restoring the government's one-seat majority in the House of Representatives, just weeks after Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce was returned and putting to rest the citizenship crisis for now. "Next year becomes a knock them down, drag them out discussion about the economy ... I'll take that fight every day of the week and twice on Sunday," Mr Laundy told Sky News on Sunday.
