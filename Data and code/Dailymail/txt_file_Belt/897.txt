Look sexy in snakeskin like Bella in Salvatore Ferragamo

Snake skin is a trend that comes around once in a while and when it does, boy do we get excited. This incredibly sophisticated and lady-like print screams luxury, which seems to be a major theme from the designers at Milan Fashion Week. The luxurious look has made a serious comeback, with designers emulating the high-end business woman vibe. Think brunching and jet-setting in heels.
Bella shows how the print can work in a multitude of colours, with her dress having elements of browns, turquoise blue, soft grey with black details and cream in the palette.
Complete with matching belt (and bag) around her waist and gorgeous co-ordinating shoes (we need those for our next night out), Salavatore Ferragamo shows that it’s time to forget about clashing colours and mixing prints, and instead to go for expensive looking pieces that co-ordinate perfectly together as one whole outfit. Single garments mashed together is so last year…
Unfortunately Bella’s dress isn’t available to buy yet, however you can shop the current collection using the link (right) or some snake print inspired pieces from the edit below.
