 'Despite everything that had occurred between Naika and her mother, Naika longed to be home,' said a 20-page report released by the Florida Department of Children & Families.'Naika often told her therapist that she greatly missed her mother and really wanted to go back home.'But reports from the child services department make it clear that the feeling was not mutual. In early January, the family's caseworker tried to meet with Alexis over concerns Naika was posting sexually inappropriate content on the internet. The caseworker was also hoping to be able to reunite the mother and daughter .Instead, Alexis replied: 'I'm good. I have nothing else to say to the state or time or going out my way for... Naika is y'all problem...I'm done with the games.'         Alexis is accused of mocking her daughter (pictured together in happier times) as she watched the two-hour long Facebook Live video, calling Venant a 'custody jit'Just two days before Naika killed herself, she had asked whether she could visit her brother.But Alexis had refused to say where he was, and when the teen showed the case manager her mother's response, they noted it was just a row of emojis giving the middle finger. In the end, it all appears to have been too much.On January 22, Naika hanged herself in the shower at her foster home in Miami while her foster parents were asleep - live streaming the whole incident on Facebook.Even then she was unable to escape the cruel taunts of her mother who is accused of watching as her daughter killed herself and mocking her with messages on the post suggesting she was just attention seeking. The Florida Department of Children and Families report said Alexis criticized her daughter as she watched the two-hour long Facebook Live video, calling her a 'custody jit' and and that she was a 'crying wolf...seeking attention'. One of the messages left said: '#ADHD games played u sad little DCF custody jit that's why u where u at for this dumb s--t n more u keep crying wolf u dead u will get buried life goes on after a jit that doesn't listen to there parents trying to be grown seeking boys and girls attention instead of her books.'         After Naika took her own life in January, her mother posted one of their text exchanges on Facbook. The pair had a fractious relationship and Naika spent 28 months in foster care during the past eight years              Gina Alexis (right) allegedly did nothing to stop her daughter Naika Venant, 14, (left) from committing suicide as the foster child broadcast on Facebook her death-by-suicide in MiamiNaika was living with a foster family at the time of her death and was found hanged from the door frame in the bathroom by Miami-Dade police. Alexis had a troublesome relationship with her daughter who was taken away from her due to physical abuse concerns.But the mother has strenuously denied she made the comments as she watched her daughter die. The comments were made from a Facebook account with the user name Gina Alexis, reported Tampa Bay Times.Following her daughter's death, Alexis attempted to lay the blame on the state, saying Naika became more rebellious after she realized her mother could no longer beat her.'I just felt like they switched up the morals and values I put in place raising my daughter,' said Alexis, whose daughter was first placed in care because of accusations her mother was abusing her.'My daughter went back and forth in the system and used that to manipulate me. She knew that, as a parent, I could not hit my child anymore. She came back and knew Mommy can't get a belt. She knew that.'The 14-year-old's short life was riddled with stints in foster homes, after she was taken away from Alexis in 2009 because there were concerns that Naika was being physically abused by her mother.Naika was placed in foster care for 28 months over the course of eight years. At one point she was passed around to 14 different homes in the span of 16 months.              Naika's mother wrote on Facebook that her daughter had known her share of problems, including run-ins with the law and schools expulsionsThe child services report detailed the abuse. When Naika was four, the agency was called to her mother's home after the girl was left unattended by a male babysitter, with no food or running water. Alexis enrolled the girl in day care and moved to another home.The next year, the report said, Naika went to the emergency room with an undisclosed chronic health condition. The child welfare agency was contacted when Alexis 'called Naika a liar and a faker.'In 2009, the report says Alexis beat Naika with a belt after the girl was sexually aggressive with another child. She was placed in foster care by child services. When caseworkers sought to learn where the six-year-old girl had learned about sex, Naika told therapists she slept in the room with her mother's boyfriends and watched 'sex movies.'The next year, after she was returned to her mother, DCF received a report that the girl was sexually abused while in foster care. The other child vehemently denied it, saying Naika was the aggressive one.According to the report, Naika ran away in 2014, telling investigators she was afraid her mother would beat her. Alexis refused to take Naika back, threatening to beat the then 11-year-old child if she was left there.              Venant was living with a foster family at the time of her death. Her friend saw her suicide broadcast online and alerted police, but by the time they arrived, the seventh-grader had diedTwo months later, a Miami judge - over the objection of caseworkers and a court-ordered lay guardian - returned Naika to her mother.But in April 2016, Alexis returned Naika to the state, saying she'd had it with her 'behavior.' On January 22, Venant decided to take to Facebook Live as she hanged herself in the bathroom. One of the girl's friends told the Miami Herald she saw some of Venant's two-hour livestream and called Miami-Dade police, who responded to her house.She then gave them a wrong address in Miami, reported the Miami Herald. When police showed up there, residents gave them the address of Venant's foster home in the suburb of Miami Gardens. Officers found the 14-year-old hanging in the bathroom and tried to resuscitate her but without success. She was rushed to Jackson North Hospital, where doctors pronounced her dead. The girl's foster parents were asleep in their bed at the time of the incident, the paper reported.  Naika's live-streamed death was just three weeks after another girl, 12-year-old Katelyn Nicole Davis, of Georgia, broadcast her own self-inflicted hanging on Facebook, claiming she had been sexually abused by a relative.              The DCF claim that Naika showed inappropriate sexual behavior and admitted in therapy that she had seen pornographic videos and slept in the same room as Alexis' boyfriendsThe child services report into Naika's death faulted the mental health professionals who worked with her for treating the symptoms of her trauma and abuse 'rather than addressing the trauma itself'. They had also failed to address the toxicity of the girl's relationship with her mother, the report found.Alexis' attorney Howard Talenfeld disputed the findings, telling the Miami Herald the report relied on inaccurate information and 'is an apparent whitewash of the systemic failures.'As news of Naika's death spread online, dozens of people took to her Facebook page, to express their condolences and pay tribute to her all-too-brief life. Alexis posted her own tribute claiming she was 'showing you tough love when u misbehaved,' adding that Naika had gone to jail twice, got expelled from two or three schools, had sex, smoked marijuana and drank alcohol.'You wasn't supposed to even have access to Internet as part of your case,' she went on to say of Naika. 'The system has failed us......'  If you need to speak to a counselor, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by calling 1 (800) 273-8255.
