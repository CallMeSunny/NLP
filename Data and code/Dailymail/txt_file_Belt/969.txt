Egyptian suspect remanded as hijacking sparks online buzz By Afp   Published: 13:18 BST, 30 March 2016  |  Updated: 13:18 BST, 30 March 2016                e-mail         The man accused of hijacking an Egyptian plane with a fake suicide belt and diverting it to Cyprus was remanded into custody Wednesday, as social media buzzed with ridicule about the bizarre incident.A judge in Larnaca on the island's southern coast ordered 58-year-old Egyptian Seif al-Din Mohamed Mostafa held for eight days as he made his first court appearance after Tuesday's hijacking.Mostafa is accused of forcing the Alexandria-to-Cairo flight to divert to Cyprus, where he demanded to see his Cypriot ex-wife, with whom he has children.

It has to be the best selfie ever," he said.As it became clear on Tuesday that the hijacker was trying to contact his ex-wife and was likely not a real danger, Egyptians also took to social media to poke fun at the incident, many using the Twitter hashtag #loveisintheair."This is what happens when you block your ex," one person wrote on Twitter, while another opined: "Some may wonder why the hijacker didn't just email his wife. They don't realise how terrible Egypt's Internet is."- 'Non-prohibited' items -H.A. Hellyer, an Arab affairs specialist at the Royal United Services Institute in London, tweeted: "My wife just told me: 'You don't love me enough. You haven't hijacked a plane to talk to me. Sort it out'"After several hours in Larnaca, passengers on the flight were flown to Cairo late on Tuesday."Fifteen minutes after departure we saw on the screens that the plane was not going to Cairo and it was crossing the sea," passenger Noha Saleh said on arrival in the Egyptian capital."They said it was a technical problem and they needed to go to Cyprus or Greece to fix it... they were professional and their attitude was normal," she said.Concerns were raised about security at Egyptian airports after a Russian airliner was downed on October 31 over the Sinai Peninsula, killing all 224 people on board. The Islamic State group claimed to have smuggled a bomb on board.The police prosecutor said Cypriot authorities would seek the help of Interpol to discover how the fake suicide belt passed through airport security in Alexandria.But Egypt's interior ministry said in a statement that all security measures had been applied.The accused hijacker and his luggage were scanned, it said, and he had used "non-prohibited belongings" in his handbag "to imply that he was wearing an explosive belt and to threaten the crew and passengers."
