Look pretty in a lilac maxi dress like Bella's




Philosophy Di Lorenzo Serafini Spring/ Sumer 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody

Do you hear that? It's 2003 knocking because boho's back. Queen of the Milan catwalks Bella Hadid gave the Spring/ Summer 2017 rendition of this early noughties trend her blessing at the Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini show. 
The Cali model walked out in a floor-length, lilac maxi dress that was half prairie girl, half Sienna Miller circa. her Jude Law phase. In a Gok Wan-ish move, the flowing frock was nipped in at the waist by a giant leather belt. Don't get any ideas about nostalgia, because this is about as new as fashion comes - it literally tripped off the catwalk only a matter of hours ago. 
Endearingly pretty and girly, the soft purple shade of Bella's dress is just the thing for warm summer evenings. While we'll have to wait until next year for Bella's to drop, get in the 2017 state-of-mind and take a scroll of our edit of boho-approved violet dresses below.
