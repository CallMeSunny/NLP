NW Pakistan military strikes, US drone kill 17 By Afp   Published: 20:25 BST, 11 November 2014  |  Updated: 20:25 BST, 11 November 2014                e-mail        12 shares    A US drone strike killed at least four militants in Pakistan's restive tribal belt near the Afghan border Tuesday, security officials said, drawing condemnation from Islamabad.Separately, 13 more militants were killed in air strikes by Pakistani forces in Khyber tribal district, believed to be militants involved in a border suicide attack that killed 55 people were hiding out.The drone attack took place in the village of Datta Khel, around 40 kilometres (25 miles) west of Miranshah, the main town of North Waziristan tribal district, in an area considered a stronghold of Taliban militants.
