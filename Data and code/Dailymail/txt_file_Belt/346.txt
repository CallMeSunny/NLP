              All in the details: The bodycon number was cinched at the waist with a matching belt and featured a pair of leather front pockets         Hair we go, hair we go! Her wavy raven locks were lifted away from her face in a high ponytail         Well red: Her striking makeup palette included smokey eyeshadow and pillar box red lipstick              Phone: Standing tall in a pair of silver heels, she was seen checking her phone as she posed       Head judge Simon Cowell made the event something of a family affair, arriving with his partner Lauren Silverman and their adorable three-year-old son Eric, who appeared to be in a notably playful mood as he posed for snaps in his dad's arms.Likely for the purposes of shooting continuity, Nicole was seen sporting the same ensemble the night before, as she shot scenes for the show with her fellow judges.She looked delighted to be reunited with her TV show pals, larking around with Louis, who was dapper in a black shirt and chinos.Sharon meanwhile suited up in a white pinstripe pajama co-ord and black heels, while Simon stuck to his tried and tested fashion formula of a white T-shirt and jeans.         Family affair: Head judge Simon Cowell made the event something of a family affair, arriving with his partner Lauren Silverman and their adorable three-year-old son EricSimon looked back in good health on Wednesday after being forced to bow out of auditions earlier in the week thanks to a sudden illness.The head judge, 57, reportedly couldn't face being present for the array of hopefuls that would have been trotted out in front of the panel to try their luck at stardom, retreating to the solitude of a dressing room and letting his co-stars take the reigns.Taking place at London's Tobacco Dock on Tuesday, a source told The Sun that Simon 'didn't feel well early in the day so had to have a bit of a slower start to the day than usual'.         Affectionate: Simon gave his offspring a kiss on the top of his head as he got a little restless              Hold me in your arms: Sharp-tongued Simon displayed his paternal side as he hugged his sonIn a slight anticlimax, the source then added: 'But he felt a bit better as Tuesday went on so decided he would attend after all!'The source also claimed that Nicole took the role of head judge in Simon's absence, 'commanding attention' and leading proceedings until Simon was able to return to his duties at the top of the judging desk.With Sharon and Nicole's missed auditions last week, ITV recruited Alesha Dixon to fill in at the recent Edinburgh auditions.               Here she is!

Party: The night before, Nicole was seen leading the party atmosphere as she and her fellow judges left X Factor auditions at the same venue         Three's not a crowd: Nicole, Louis Walsh and Sharon Osbourne looked a little lost as to where to go as they headed out of the studio together         Commanding attention: With belt detail at the waist, Nicole's hourglass curves stole the spotlight, while a glimpse of her toned legs were also on show in the midi-length number         Come here you! Nicole leaned in for a smooch from her long-term pal Louis       What's more, the music mogul has supposedly expressed that special guest performers - usually reserved for the Sunday shows - appear on both nights, rather than featuring two every Sunday.There's also rumblings that he wants to cut the number of live weeks down from 10 to six; and further gossip suggests he wants the audition stages to take place randomly at Thorpe Park.To round off the changes, Simon is said to have had it with novelty acts such as Jedward or Wagner from seasons' past, after last year Honey G came a little too close to potentially winning the entire series.               Dressed for bed: Kooky Sharon was chic in a white pinstripe pajama co-ord for the auditions         Girls just wanna have fun: Sharon and Nicole larked around for the cameras         Back for more: The same judging panel has reunited for another run of the ITV show         Having some fun: Nicole shared some fun Snapchats with her boss Simon          Here come the boys: Simon was joined by X Factor host Dermot O'Leary  on Wednesday night              Back to full health: After being forced to skip some auditions on Tuesday after being taken suddenly ill, head judge Simon was back in good spirits on Wednesday night         Twists in store: Simon and the producers are considering altering the tried and tested Saturday and Sunday live shows for the new series          Royal wave!
