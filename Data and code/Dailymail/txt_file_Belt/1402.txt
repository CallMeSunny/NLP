 He also imposed a 10-year order preventing Pollard from having contact with Miss Wherritt, who has waived her right to anonymity. Matthew Bean, prosecuting, said Pollard had consensual sex with Miss Wherritt, who had a fantasy about being kidnapped, before 'play-acting' by putting her in the car. He said: 'He suggested he would tie her wrists together and put her in the boot of the car. She admits she permitted him to [do it].         The 29-year-old then knocked Miss Wherritt (pictured together) out twice in the middle of a town centre, Teesside Crown Court heard         Police investigate the incident after it happened. The vehicle was driven a short distance along Oxford Road before it stopped outside a barber's shop where he began 'ridiculing' her, the court heard'At 4pm the defendant stopped his car close to a number of shops. He was seen lying on the pavement and the boot was opened.'Witnesses could see her in the boot. He got up off the pavement and staggered into a hair salon and asked members of staff to "come out here and look at this".'He was told repeatedly to leave the shop, which he eventually did.'Pollard then returned to the car before pulling Miss Wherritt out of the boot, the court heard.         Judge Simon Hickey jailed Pollard for eight months and ordered him to pay £400 compensation and £900 court costsThe vehicle was driven a short distance along Oxford Road before it stopped outside a barber's shop where he began 'ridiculing' her.Mr Bean added: 'The barber's shop was full of people, including children. Witnesses saw him hitting her repeatedly to the head with his elbow until she appeared to lose consciousness.' Shortly after she came round, he was then seen hitting her again until she again fell unconscious and slumped into the passenger footwell.The victim was taken to hospital but suffered no serious injuries.Peter Kilgour, defending, said Pollard was of previous good character, and admitted his behaviour was 'inexcusable'.Miss Wherritt, who has since had to seek help from a domestic violence charity, said she had been with Pollard on and off for around six years at the time of the incident. She said: 'He's got a lot of trust problems and was always causing stupid arguments. 'He's terrible, he controlled my life. He made me feel like I was responsible for him but he's beyond help. He's destroyed everything I care about. My life is a shell of what it was.' '[The drugs] messed his head up.' Jailing Pollard, Judge Hickey said: 'There were a number of offences of violence and two offences of damage all perpetrated against Lucinda Wherritt.'This is a common theme of men who dislike their partners speaking to other men.'The incidents are unusual and bizarre in my opinion. She had injuries around her neck, a small mark on her forehead and bruising on her body.'This reveals a violent and controlling relationship.'
