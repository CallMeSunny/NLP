   Instead he has suggested he may move up to featherweight to face Welshman, and IBF champion, Lee Selby in an all-British bout or WBA champion Leo Santa Cruz.WBA wrote to Frampton last month asking him to clarify his plans but he failed to provide a response. Rigondeaux, unbeaten in seven years as a professional after defecting from Cuba, was the WBA super-bantamweight champion before Frampton but had the belt taken off him for inactivity.He is now likely to face Moises Flores, the unbeaten Mexican, for the newly vacant title.           Rigondeaux (right) dominated highly-rated Nonito Donaire in April 2013 but has regularly been avoided since Frampton has also been ordered to fulfil a mandatory defence of his IBF belt against Shingo Wake, but is likely to forfeit that title too if he moves up in weight.  WBA chairman Gilberto Jesus Mendoza said: 'In light of Frampton's announced intention to face an opponent other than his mandatory, and for failing to respond to WBA inquiries as to his intent, Frampton's recognition as champion is removed.'Rigondeux shall come out of recess and face interim champion Moises Flores as his mandatory defence on or before August 1, 2016. If Flores or Rigondeaux wish to face any other opponent, the WBA may consider an application for special permit consistent with the rules of the WBA.'Rigondeaux, whose scheduled fight in Liverpool against James 'Jazza' Dickens in March was cancelled due to visa issues, has been highly critical of Frampton for not wanting to fight him.         Rigondeaux, pictured in 2007, stands with some of the trophies and medals he won as a peerless amateur'Frampton and Quigg are both cowards for finding ways to avoid the best in their division,' he said in February.The Cuban southpaw, 35, was unimpressed with Frampton's cagey split-decision win over Quigg in Manchester.'No wonder (Frampton) has been running away from me 4 years. He can't even box. Do you guys remember what happen 2 Nonito (Donaire)? Wait until I get his guy!' Rigondeaux tweeted.In his post-fight interview Frampton mentioned Leo Santa Cruz and Lee Selby as potential future opponents and Barry McGuigan, his trainer, said: 'What do we gain by fighting him (Rigondeaux)?'It is another frustrating episode in Rigondeaux's tumultuous career, as his 122-pound rivals continue to view him as a high risk-low reward opponent.      RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Eric Hunter backed to beat Lee Selby for IBF featherweight...
