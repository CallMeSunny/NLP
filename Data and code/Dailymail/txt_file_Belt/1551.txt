         VOX by Christina Dalcher (HQ £12.99, 336 pp)VOXby Christina Dalcher (HQ £12.99, 336 pp)  In the not-so-distant future, the American Bible Belt has expanded and holds the country in its grip. The governing Pure Movement ensures women are seen but not heard.Every woman is given a wrist device that gives the wearer a high-voltage shock if she speaks more than 100 words in a day. They have no jobs, no books, no mercy.Dr Jean McClellan is offered a reprieve in exchange for her specialist knowledge which may help cure the president’s younger brother, who was in a skiing accident.Her new freedom gives her an opportunity to change things — but will she be able to outwit the system?This is both a cleverly imagined political dystopian work of fiction and a fast-paced, twisting thriller that left me speechless with anticipation.        RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       I pledged loyalty to Bin Laden, then spied for MI6: Author...

After undergoing an operation to give her sight, she wakes to a world that makes little sense to her and one she must learn to negotiate.In steps Kate, an architect, who is staying in the same hospital after falling and hitting her head.As Kate’s marriage disintegrates — her relationship with her policeman husband, Tony, becomes tainted with doubt and suspicion — their friendship develops into something deeper.The novel is built around a thought-provoking concept that allows the author to punctuate the novel with Nova’s ‘rules of seeing’.Her journey back to sight is fascinating and superbly portrayed. However, the relationship between the two women is less convincing and the character of Kate’s husband veers dangerously close to cliche as the melodramatic ending approaches.              THE INCENDIARIES by R. O. Kwon (Virago £14.99, 224 pp)THE INCENDIARIESby R. O. Kwon (Virago £14.99, 224 pp)  When Will Kendall, a ‘child evangelical’ who has lost his faith, arrives at Edwards University, he invents a new history for himself in order to fit in, not admitting that he waits tables and relies on staff meals because his scholarship funding isn’t enough.He meets Phoebe Lin, once a musical prodigy, whose grief and guilt following her mother’s death dog her existence. Her initial friendship with Will becomes a rewarding, but difficult, affair. Also in town is John Leal, an alumnus of Edwards turned leader of the Jejah movement. He deliberately targets Phoebe, drawing her into his sect and removing her from any outside influence.When Jejah commits explosive acts of violence against abortion clinics, Phoebe is implicated in the deaths of several people — then she disappears and Will is left trying to trace her.What an intriguing novel. Told in spare, revealing prose from the three central characters’ points of view, it makes the reader look again at faith, fanaticism and identity.
