Clinton works to shore up support in U.S. Rust Belt By Reuters   Published: 22:22 BST, 30 July 2016  |  Updated: 22:22 BST, 30 July 2016                e-mail         By Amanda BeckerJOHNSTOWN, Pa., July 30 - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton toured the U.S. Rust Belt on Saturday, seeking to shore up support from working-class voters in the region by promising to raise wages and reject bad international trade deals."We are going to say 'no' to unnfair trade deals, we're going to stand up to China," Clinton told unionized workers at Johnstown Wire Technologies."I feel strongly about this and I need your help," she added.A pending Asia trade deal negotiated by President Barack Obama has become a flashpoint in the U.S. presidential campaign. Clinton has said she opposes the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) because it does not do enough to protect U.S. workers.Trump has said he would rip it up and questioned whether Clinton would keep her stance if she wins the Nov. 8 presidential election.Leo Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers, which represents roughly 200 of the 260 workers employed by Johnstown Wire Technologies, assured the crowd in his introduction of Clinton that Republicans have been "telling lies" about Clinton's stance on the deal.Clinton, along with her running-mate Tim Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia, is on a three-day tour of Pennsylvania and Ohio after becoming the first woman to accept a major U.S. party's presidential nomination at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia on Thursday.Pennsylvania and Ohio are two states in the U.S. Rust Belt that are dealing with job losses caused by the decline in U.S. manufacturing. Neither leans heavily in favor of either political party but both voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012.Trump has zeroed in on white, working-class voters in the region as critical to his campaign and plans to visit both states early next week.Cambria County, where Clinton visited Johnstown Wire Technologies, is 94-percent white and has a median household income of $42,000.Clinton and Kaine are on a jobs-focused tour that began in Philadelphia and will also hit Pittsburgh, Youngstown and Columbus. They are trying to contrast their plan to use infrastructure investments to create jobs with that of Trump, whom Clinton said Friday has a "downbeat vision of America.""We are visiting places that prove what Americans can do," Clinton said in Johnstown. "This country and our people have what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead if they have the leadership that gives us that chance."(Reporting by Amanda Becker; Editing by Sandra Maler)
