The fight is on! Newt Gingrich victory in South Carolina means no more Mr Inevitable for Mitt Romney By Toby Harnden for the Daily Mail   Updated: 12:11 BST, 22 January 2012                e-mail         What a turnaround! A week ago, it look like Mitt Romney was going to head into the Florida primary with three victories under his belt. Then it turned out that Rick Santorum won Iowa after all and South Carolina voters backed Newt Gingrich, delivering a message to Romney and the media: "Not so fast!"So, for the first time in Republican history there's been a three-way split decision between Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Next up, in 10 days' time, is Florida, where Romney holds a solid double-digit lead and has the money and organisation that should ensure he wins a large state with nine separate television markets.      Conceded: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, pictured with his family at a rally last night, finished second in the South Carolina primary Of course, Romney's emphatic 16-point win in New Hampshire and consequent double-digit poll lead here in South Carolina should have delievered him victory tonight so no one in Romneyworld will be taking anything for granted in the Sunshine State.        More from Toby Harnden for the Daily Mail...     Obama jokes Jack Lew's loopy signature could 'debase our currency' as he makes him official pick for Treasury Secretary 10/01/13     Pastor pulls out of Barack Obama inauguration ceremony after furore over 'anti-gay' comments 10/01/13     Chris Christie branded 'The Boss' on front cover of Time magazine but insists it'd be 'crazy' to think of run at the White House (for now at least) 09/01/13     Beware the X Date: America could run out of cash on February 15 unless another bruising deal is struck on tax and spending cuts 08/01/13     Blow to Obama as terror suspect linked to Benghazi consulate attack is freed 08/01/13     Fiscal strife: Republican husband and wife team in Congress split over looming tax rises 13/12/12     'I didn't help Obama win': Chris Christie hits back at GOP critics who claim he sunk Romney's chances during Hurricane Sandy 13/12/12     Jimmy Carter comes out in favor of legalising pot saying it's good to experiment in a few states 12/12/12     Mitt Romney defeats Barack Obama . . . in congressional district tally after the election 10/12/12     VIEW FULL ARCHIVE     What did it for Gingrich here? Two very strong debate performances were key. His best moment was his exchange with Juan Williams of Fox in Monday's Myrtle Beach debate in which he gave full-throated voice to the conservative philosophy of self-help and free enterprise as well as casting aside political correctness and racial tiptoeing.Then, the much-ballyhooed ABC News interview with his second wife Marianne backfired spectacularly. CNN gave Gingrich a gift by asking him about the "open marriage" allegation right at the start of Thursday's debate in Charleston. Savaging the "liberal media" is almost invariably a winner in Republican primaries and Gingrich took full advantage.More generally, however, South Carolina voters decided they did not want a coronation or to send an unvetted nominee into battle against President Barack Obama, with a billion dollars in campaign funds behind him, in November.He remains the favourite for the GOP nomination but it is now clear that Romney is no shoo-in. And nor should he be. Obama's long and bitter primary contest with Hillary Clinton in 2008 ultimately meant that he was battle-tested for the general election. Whoever emerges as the Republican nominee in 2012 needs to be the same.Romney, uncharacteristically, was vague and halting in the two debates this week and need to turn in a strong performance in Tampa on Monday. In his "concession" speech (I never heard him concede to or congratulate Gingrich) he was fiercely combative, indicating that he will go for Gingrich's throat in Florida.      Too vague? Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and his wife Ann wave to supporters       Winner: Republican U.S. presidential candidate and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich with his wife Callista. He made two strong debate performances in south Carolina Previewing a key line of attack, Romney compared Gingrich to Obama: "Our party can’t be led to victory by someone who also has never run a business and never run a state."Gingrich still has a mountain to climb. By every measure, he is significantly behind in Florida and one lesson of this race so far is that momentum from one victory matters very little. But tonight has burst the bubble of inevitability in which Romney had been enveloped.Romney's opponents have long suspected he has a glass jaw. Now we will see whether he can take a punch, get up off the floor and keep fighting.      Three horse race? Republican presidential candidate, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum at a rally in Charleston last night George W. Bush recovered from a drubbing in New Hampshire in 2000 at the hands of John McCain. Barack Obama overcame a stunning defeat at the hands of Clinton in the same state in 2008. Romney now has the chance to prove he is made of similar stuff.Gingrich, the early December front runner, has already sunk once in the polls under sustained negative attack from Romney, Ron Paul and Rick Perry. He'll need to brace himself for a Romney onslaught in Florida with every detail of his ethics violations, marital infidelities, House leadership stumbles and activities on behalf of Freddie Mac laid bare for all to see.To comment on this article please visit Toby's blog10 THINGS MITT ROMNEY NEEDS TO DO TO DEFEAT NEWT GINGRICH South Carolina was a disaster for Mitt Romney and this past week one of the worst for any presidential candidate in modern times. Fresh off a convincing win in New Hampshire and cloaked in a new aura of inevitability, he blew a double-digit lead and lost by 13 points to Newt Gingrich, a man who even his supporters acknowledge has more baggage than American Airlines.So how does Romney recover and defeat the man now standing in the way of his six-year quest for the Republican nomination? Here are 10 things to start with...1. Deliver a powerful debate performance in Tampa on Monday and don't cede the stage to Gingrich.2. Find a quick, clean, convincing way of addressing the issue of tax returns and stop the waffling.3. Attack, attack and attack Gingrich by name with facts about his record. But do it in a way that avoids snideness and does not seem like the politics of personal destruction. Make Gingrich seem a risky and dangerous choice to go up against President Obama - this last week he has been winning the argument that he is more electable. Never lose sight of the main opponent - Obama - but never give a sense of believing the nomination in the bag (shouldn't be too hard: it isn't).      What're you going to do? Mitt Romney (left) with rival Newt Gingrich talk during a commercial break at the Republican presidential candidate debate on Thursday January 19 4. Settle in for the long haul and keep patiently building a machine that will deliver delegates. If need be, bring Gingrich down. He's not even on the ballot in Missouri or his home state of Virginia.5. Make Gingrich lose his cool, as he did in December. Hope the Romney-aligned super PAC goes hard negative against Newt and up the proportion of Romney campaign "contrast" ads - the anti-Gingrich stuff can't be left to the super PAC.6. Overhaul campaign events. No more anti-septic halls and above-the-fray stuff. Ditch the current stump speech - it sounds cheesy and hackneyed. Speak with feeling. Don't pretend South Carolina wasn't a setback.7. Calm the shattered nerves of establishment backers and ensure that none defect to Gingrich.8. Build up Rick Santorum and keep him in the race as long as possible. Every vote for him is one denied to Gingrich.9. Stop campaigning with establishment types like John McCain, Chris Christie, Nikki Haley and Bob McDonnell. They make voters feel like they are being railroaded by the party. They want to see Mitt Romney "earn it" - the phrase the campaign used successfully in New Hampshire - on his own. Jeb Bush might seem like a great endorsement to get, but big endorsements have helped precious little thus far.10.  Become the defender of capitalism. Take a leaf out of Gingrich's book by speaking passionately and unashamedly for American values of free enterprise. Caution will not provide a path to victory.
