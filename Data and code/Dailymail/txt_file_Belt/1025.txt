Lebanese soldiers patrol the Corniche al-Mazraa neighbourhood of the capital Beirut A security source said the two others killed were Hamza's mother and niece.A medical source earlier said at least three civilians were among the wounded.The army said Hamza was wanted in connection with several incidents in which gunmen opened fire on soldiers and civilians in Tripoli.Gunmen in the Bab el-Tebbaneh district of the coastal city often clash with others in the neighbouring Alawite district of Jabal Mohsen as well as fire on army patrols.The army launched a security plan in April 2014 in an effort to stabilise Tripoli, which has seen successive rounds of deadly fighting between the two neighbourhoods.
