Lights, camera... inaction: Drama behind the scenes at Pinewood as expansion plans are put on hold againBy Rob Davies for the Daily Mail  Published: 23:11 BST, 26 December 2013  |  Updated: 12:40 BST, 27 December 2013                e-mail          1 View  comments    Don’t despair, but Ant-Man will not be coming to Britain. The film - about a superhero scientist who can shrink to the size of an insect - was due to be shot in the UK.Faced with a lack of studio capacity, its producers have decided to take their money elsewhere.It may not sound like the greatest tragedy in the history of British cultural achievement, but Pinewood Shepperton boss Ivan Dunleavy warns that more is at stake.        Blockbuster: Star Wars is one of many of the world's most famous films produced at Pinewood  Project Pinewood - a plan to double the size of the film studio complex - has twice been rejected on the grounds that it would involve developing green belt land.The outcome of a public inquiry now rests with planning minister Eric Pickles, with a decision likely to come in April.‘We were here first,’ cries Dunleavy, raising his fist in the air like some sort of Che Guevara of British cinema.   More...   RSA is under the weather as storms and flooding wreak havoc across Britain   ‘We are in the unfortunate situation that the green belt line was drawn around Pinewood,’ he explains.‘It’s not about whether the land is pretty, in the sense of the Lake District,’ says Dunleavy, too savvy to point out that the land in question – next to the M25 - is hardly one of nature’s most breathtaking landscapes.‘It’s about whether the positive aspects of our argument are sufficient to outweigh the negatives of developing on green belt land.’ Major production houses such as Disney and Star Wars-maker Lucasfilm have made their case to the Government on why Pinewood deserves to grow.Pinewood is virtually synonymous with British film, with national institutions such as the Carry Ons in its archive, but Dunleavy is intent on making sure it keeps the country’s industry on the map.David Cameron’s government has seemingly thrown its weight behind the industry with a succession of tax breaks for film and TV.But such incentives, Dunleavy points out, can’t fuel growth when there is no space into which Pinewood - and others - can expand.‘It’s clear that their policy objective is to broaden the economy and focus on the creative industries. ‘If we’re in a situation where we’re struggling to cope with demand, then expanding that capacity makes sense for us, the industry and the UK.’Dunleavy is diplomatic when it comes to politics but a little more touchy when it comes to public perceptions of the film industry.       Director's chair: Chief Executive Ivan Dunleavy  An innocuous question about why film producers would leave the bright lights, 24-hour shopping and sun-kissed beaches of Los Angeles for rainy, grey old Britain elicits an indignant response.‘You have a very rosy view of the life of a film producer,’ he expostulates.‘It’s a jolly hard job! The glamorous bit happens at the premiere.’Even a light-hearted inquiry about whether he and his chairman - TV industry veteran Lord Michael Grade - exchange film trivia with each other, meets with disdain.‘Hopefully you’re not going to write any of this nonsense in the paper!’ Yet despite an almost pathological phobia of acknowledging the gloss attached to the business, Dunleavy – who together with Grade took overPinewood in 2000 with £62m from investment firm 3i before merging it with Shepperton - admits there is a buzz when a big production comes to town.The most electric atmosphere is reserved for the James Bond franchise, whose history is inextricably linked to that of Pinewood, since its days as part of the J Arthur Rank film empire.‘It’s hard to pretend that there isn’t excitement if there’s a Bond film in, or something,’ he admits.Dr No, the first in the beloved series, was shot here in 1962.A press aide points out Goldfinger Avenue, where Sean Connery crashed his Aston Martin DB5 in the film of the same name.Is Dunleavy ever tempted to ask for a walk-on cameo as a dastardly villain, or sneak onto the set at night wearing a tuxedo and toting a Walther PPK from the props room?‘One has to know one’s limitations,’ he says, drily. ‘You wouldn’t expect a hotel manager to go into the guests’ bedroom.’At the heart of the determination to avoid talking showbiz is a desire to show how just serious a business making a film is, with so much artisanship going on behind the scenes that audiences never see.This element of industrial endeavour is the cornerstone of his argument for why Pinewood – and by extension the industry – deserves the state’s full support.As most of us curl up on the sofa over the holidays to watch old black and white favourites for the umpteenth time, Dunleavy is intent on raising awareness of how important the British film industry is to the economy.‘Just look at the credits on any recent big budget film,’ he says.‘There are people with craft skills, making wigs, wicker baskets, technical skills, professional skills, artistic skills.‘Then you’ve got a supply chain that goes to service that, hiring cameras, providing production vehicles, a vast range of stuff.‘It’s not just the soft benefit – the Italian Job and Minis – it’s about what this sector can do to promote tourist visits, export earnings, all of those things.    ‘If you scatter that around the place [by blocking Project Pinewood] it doesn’t work.’The ambitious plan includes more than 90,000 square meters of offices, workshops and studios, as well as streetscapes of Venice, Paris and Amsterdam.            Dunleavy won’t even discuss what will happen if the blueprint is rejected for a third time, although it must be a distinct possibility.He feels that Pinewood’s case has already been made, not least by an Oxford Economics study that shows the film industry is directly responsible for 43,900 jobs, adding £1.6billion to Britain’s GDP.If Pinewood can’t expand in the UK, it certainly can abroad.It now has a US studio in Atlanta, Georgia, as well as facilities in Toronto, the Dominican Republic and Malaysia, all with the aim of producing content for different regional markets.A significant recent development has been its partnership with Seven Stars in China to create a new film venture for the burgeoning ranks of film buffs in the People’s Republic.‘The middle class in China is approaching 600m people – their middle class is bigger than Europe.‘They are looking for a better quality of entertainment and that is what the UK can do. ‘Even if we get just a few films into that market, it’s a meaningful contributor to growth.’Pinewood is also extending its reach into new areas of business, such as film finance, dipping into its cash reserves to fund low-budget projects that might otherwise never see the light of day.The subject offers another chance for Dunleavy to display his impatient side, this time in answer to whether Pinewood sets a strict target for expected returns before committing its cash.‘Oh, you mean sensible business objectives? Yeah, there is,’ he says, with more than a touch of impatience.The film finance arm of Pinewood is partly about supporting independent productions but also about remembering that the penniless amateur director of today could be the James Cameron of tomorrow.‘We have a mechanism to allow them [small productions] to work alongside big budget productions in a way that improves the utilisation of our assets.‘It’s also about building relationships with the big budget customers of the future.’Judging by his longevity in the role, Dunleavy might just be around when big budget customers of tomorrow come calling.He’s been in the job 13 years, a monster of an innings in the cut-and-thrust world of the FTSE.‘You wouldn’t do it if you didn’t enjoy it. The challenge is something that everybody on the team experiences. It’s an interesting sector because it’s constantly changing.’Finally, in a roundabout sort of way, he is talking about his love of film, despite an admission that ‘I thought I’d dodged that question’.But the business of promoting Project Pinewood is never far from his mind.‘In terms of higher value added activities, this is one of the key sectors for the UK.‘The realisation is creeping into our thinking about the economy as a whole. That’s encouraging because it is one of the sectors where we can compete and punch way above our weight on a global scale.’It’s a sentiment that 007 would approve of.
