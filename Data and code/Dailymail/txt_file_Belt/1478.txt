 In the wake of his arrest, Cypriot authorities were able to determine that Mustafa's suicide belt had been a fake.'According to security sources received from Cyprus Authorities at Larnaca International Airport, which stated that the explosive belt that the hijacker allegedly said that he was wearing, is fake,' EgyptAir said in a statement.During the hostage situation on the tarmac, Mustafa made a series of erratic requests, including asking to meet with representatives of the European Union, and to be taken to other airports. A picture from the tarmac shows the moment the attacker hands over a four-page letter intended for his ex-wife, as a female airport official stands with her head in her hands. While not initially making any demands beyond his ex-wife and asylum, the hijacker then asked in his letter for the release of 63 female prisoners in Egypt, according to Cypriot TV station Sigma Live.

The couple lived on the island until 1994, after which he divorced her and returned to Egypt, according to Sigma Live. Egypt's civil aviation minister Sharif Fathi, said at a press conference that there has been confusion over the identity of the hijacker, after government officials gave the man's name as Ibrahim Samaha.                This image which has been shared widely on social media reportedly shows Seif Eldin Mustafa wearing his 'suicide belt' on the hijacked EgyptAir plane         CCTV footage showing alleged hijacker Seif Eldin Mustafa passing through security at Alexandria before boarding EgyptAir MS181         A man, believed to be a member of the crew, leaves the hijacked aircraft of Egyptair from the pilot's window shortly before the hijacker was arrested         Cyprus police have evacuated a stretch of beach near the tarmac, as at least four more people were allowed to leave the plane shortly after midday, with one man seen climbing out of the cockpit        However, this was later retracted, with the Cypriot Ministry of Foreign Affairs naming him as Seif Eldin Mustafa - and the Egyptian government issuing an apology.EgyptAir MS181, carrying 62 people, including eight Brits and ten Americans, was en-route from Alexandria to Cairo when it was hijacked, forcing it to land on Cyprus. Negotiations with the hijacker during the morning resulted in the release of a majority of the hostages, except for the crew and four foreigners, EgyptAir said. The hijacking of the plane, carrying 55 passengers and a crew of seven, was confirmed by EgyptAir on Twitter at 7.40am GMT.Flight MS181 took off from the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria en route to Cairo with at least 55 passengers, including 26 foreigners, and a seven-member crew.An official with flight-tracking website FlightRadar24 said the plane showed no immediate signs of distress. The flight between Alexandria and Cairo normally takes about 30 minutes.

Three other foreigners could not be identified.The plane landed at Larnaca airport at around 8.50am (6.50am GMT), police in Cyprus said.Cypriot government officials said that after the plane landed, the hijacker demanded that police vehicles move away from the aircraft.Mustafa reportedly demanded he be allowed to fly to Istanbul, according to one crew member said, and is said to have asked for a refueling truck when told there was no fuel in the plane.But such claims were refuted by airport officials, who said no other destinations had been mentioned.Meanwhile, it has also been revealed that the co-pilot tried to calm the hijacker down, but when he was unsuccessful he returned to the cockpit, broke a window and managed to escape.Forty of the 55 passengers were later flown back to Egypt on a special flight on Tuesday night and the remainder booked to return to their home countries on separate flights.               Hijacked: The EgyptAir was enroute to Cairo, carrying 62 people - including eight Brits and ten Americans - when it was hijacked by a man in an explosive vest         Passengers are reunited with their luggage on the tarmac after being allowed off the plane, where the crew and four hostages are reportedly still being held          Egyptian media reports that he ordered the pilot to fly to Turkey but was told they did not have enough fuelIbrahim Abdel Tawab Samaha was identified as the hijacker by Egyptian government spokesman Hossam al-Queish earlier on Tuesday - a statement which has now been retracted.The wife of Samaha, a university professor from Alexandria, called Egyptian media to rubbish the claims that her husband was involved.The woman, who identified herself as Nahla, said her husband, with the same name, is not the hijacker and that he was on his way to Cairo en route to the United States to attend a conference.She told the private TV network ONTV that her husband had never been to Cyprus and that a photo shown international news purporting to show the hijacker is not her husband.Questions have been raised as to how the hijacker was able to embark on the plane wearing the suicide vest.Egyptian authorities promised to tighten airport security in the wake of the downing of a Russian Metrojet airplane in October last year, where all 224 passengers died.                The hijacker, believed to be a 27-year-old Egyptian national, continues to hold the crew and four passengers of unknown nationalities hostage on the tarmac       Emergency landing: The Egypt Air jet  was en-route from Alexandria to Cairo when it  was reportedly hijacked       After leaving Alexandria the plane was diverted from it's route to Cairo, and flown to Cyprus                Investigations later found that explosives had been smuggled onto the Airbus A321-231, most likely at Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport, which then crashed minutes after it took off from the Red Sea resort.A spokesperson for Prime Minister David Cameron said British diplomats are on the ground and in touch with Cypriot authorities.'The national security adviser is chairing a meeting of senior officials from across Whitehall to review the situation and to get the latest on what we know. 'There is obviously speculation about the numbers [but] at this stage we are working to establish what the facts actually are and this is one of the things they will be discussing at this meeting of officials.''It's important that we establish the facts rather than speculate about numbers.'
