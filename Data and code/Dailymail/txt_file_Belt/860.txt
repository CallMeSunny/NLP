Alec Baldwin has added another presidential impression to his belt - founding father George Washington. The actor debuted the impression in an advertisement for his Spike TV special, One Night Only with Alec Baldwin. Turns out, Baldwin's version of the founding father doesn't sound so different than his impression of President Donald Trump, which landed him a role on Saturday Night Live last season.The actor injected plenty of Trump humor into the advertisement, boasting of grabbing 'so much freedom from those British losers' and creating a 'terrific incredible country for everybody - even the haters and the losers'.        'Hello everyone, it's me George Washington, the guy who made America great the first time. People didn't know I talk like this, but it's true, I can not tell a lie. This is how I sound,' Baldwin says, dressed in Colonial military garb and wearing a powdered wig. 'I come to you this Independence Day with a special message. First: you're welcome. For your amazing freedoms, creating all this tremendous democracy, I grabbed so much freedom from those British losers.
