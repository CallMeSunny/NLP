Bika eyes super middleweight division By Australian Associated Press   Published: 03:32 BST, 5 April 2015  |  Updated: 03:32 BST, 5 April 2015                e-mail         Sakio Bika's quest for a light heavyweight world-title belt fell short in the snow and ice of Canada's Quebec City, but the Australian warrior has no plans to retire from boxing.The 35-year-old's unanimous points loss to Canada's WBC champion Adonis Stevenson on Saturday was his second consecutive title defeat since August.Bika was valiant, but Stevenson showed the power and skill that has led him to five title defences since knocking out the division's former champion Chad Dawson in 2013."I took too long in the fight to really get going," Bika told AAP after the bout in Quebec City's Pepsi Coliseum."I was strong at the end and was putting on the pressure and making inroads, but early on I was too hesitant."Judges Glen Crocker, Don Griffin and Jack Woodburn scored the bout 115-111, 116-110 and 115-110 respectively.Bika, who lost his WBC super middleweight title in August to Anthony Dirrell, stepped up a weight division to face Stevenson.Referee Michael Griffin ruled Bika was knocked down in the sixth round, but replays showed Stevenson's left hand missed and the awkward Bika lost his footing and fell to the canvas.Bika was legitimately knocked down late in the ninth round when Stevenson hit him with a short left hand on the chin."I know Sakio Bika is a tough guy, so I prepared for 12 rounds," Stevenson, 37, said.Stevenson improves to a 26 win (21 knockout), one loss professional record and is expected to fight Russia's undefeated WBA, IBF and WBO champ Sergey "Krusher" Kovalev next.Bika falls to 32 wins (21 KO), seven losses and three draws.Bika said he only moved up to light heavyweight because he was offered the Stevenson title shot, so there was a good chance he would go back to super middleweight.There were no plans to retire."No, I think there's still good fights in me so I don't think I'll consider retiring at this stage," he said.Born in Cameroon, Bika represented the central African nation at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, met wife Belinda in the harbour city, became an Australian citizen and the couple has three children.
