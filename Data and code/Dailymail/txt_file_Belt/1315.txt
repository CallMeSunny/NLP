   'The Saint' has gone on to fight for a world title on two occasions but was twice stopped by Carl Froch, first in Manchester in November 2013 before his chilling knock-out at Wembley last May.Groves is now in line to fight WBC champion Badou Jack during the summer but DeGale has the chance to finally win the duo's race to a world title this Saturday.'Of course it means something to beat George Groves to winning a world title,' he admitted. 'That is all on the line and I can't let this chance slip.                 Groves beat DeGale as an amateur and when the pair met in a professional fight in 2011'I'm too good to get too many chances at titles. People aren't going to fight me for a voluntary defence so I have to take this opportunity against a good opponent.'Tell me who is better than Dirrell apart from me?'DeGale became the No.1 contender for the IBF belt by stopping previously undefeated American Brandon Gonzales on the Froch-Groves II undercard at Wembley last year.         'The Saint' has lost both of his title fights to Carl Froch, and DeGale can now pip his rival to the honourAt the time, the IBF strap was held by Froch but 'The Cobra' decided to vacate the title rather than face his mandatory challenger and compatriot DeGale.Although retirement looks most likely, 37-year-old Froch has suggested that an all-British superfight with 'Chunky' would appeal to him if the 2008 gold medalist returns from Boston with his old title.But DeGale said: 'I think Froch is finished and he should retire. He's getting on, earned a lot of money. He needs to relax, chill and retire. I expect him to retire.'There's no point in him coming to me. I would absolutely batter him. He would not win a round off me.'
