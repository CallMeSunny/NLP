 The chief constable of Devon and Cornwall Police released a statement following the force’s guilty plea at Bristol Crown Court on Friday. Shaun Sawyer said he could now express his “deepest regret” to the family of Thomas Orchard, who died in hospital seven days after being taken into custody in October 2012. His statement read: “From 2002 until 2012, Devon and Cornwall Police researched, procured and trained members of the organisation in the use of an emergency restraint belt. “That piece of equipment was used during the restraint of Thomas Orchard on October 3 2012. “Following his restraint and detention, Thomas became unconscious and a week later died. “In the intervening six years, my thoughts have always been with Thomas, his family and friends who have lost a loved one.          Thomas Orchard was restrained at Heavitree Road Police Station in October 2012 (Claire Hayhurst/PA)  “It is only today that I have been able to personally offer my deepest regret to all those individuals. “From the outset, Devon and Cornwall Police has co-operated fully with the Independent Office for Police Conduct, the Health and Safety Executive and the Crown Prosecution Service. “Throughout the last six years, I have had the opportunity to review the totality of this matter and latterly, the evidence provided to me by the Crown Prosecution Service in pursuit of a single offence charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. “In respect of the use of the emergency restraint belt, it is my belief that the standards expected by Devon and Cornwall Police were not met between 2002 and 2012 and did not meet the legal threshold of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. “In the spirit of candour and out of respect to the courts, the family of Thomas, the public and my workforce, I have decided – as the corporate responsibility of this organisation, that it is only right to plead guilty on behalf of Devon and Cornwall Police to this charge. “However, legal matters remain outstanding in respect of whether this health and safety breach caused the death of Thomas. “We must respect this court process as the judge is still to make a determination on this very issue, and it is not for Devon and Cornwall Police to make a decision on such a critical matter. “This is an extremely complex matter and it remains to be determined by the court. It is therefore inappropriate for me to comment further at this particular juncture.”
