 BEIJING, April 26 (Reuters) - The European Economic Area wants to sign a memorandum of understanding on China's Belt and Road initiative as a whole and not as individual states, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Friday. Altmaier, speaking on the sidelines of a summit on China's programme to re-create the old Silk Road joining China with Asia and Europe, said China is a partner and a competitor at the same time and that the European Union must defend its interests.
