Russian President Vladimir Putin today praised Chinese President Xi Jinping's multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, saying it meshes perfectly with the goals of the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union.Putin's comments to the Belt and Road forum in Beijing could ease concerns over potential tensions between China and Russia, given Beijing's rapidly expanding economic footprint in Central Asia, which is seen as Moscow's traditional sphere of influence.The three-day forum is the diplomatic highlight of the year for China, with 37 world leaders in attendance, along with 5,000 other representatives from 150 countries.

 The US' attitude towards the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative has undergone a shift in recent years that largely reflects the tense state of relations between the two nations.Washington sent a senior White House official to the first BRI summit in 2017 but has dismissed the initiative as a 'vanity project' and rebuked Italy for signing up to the scheme.Xi's signature foreign policy, in its sixth year, aims to reinvent the ancient Silk Road to connect Asia to Europe and Africa through massive investments in maritime, road and rail projects.In a speech to kick off the summit, Xi sought to bat away concerns about his ambitious initiative, saying his global infrastructure project will have 'zero tolerance' for corruption while vowing to prevent debt risks.

The initiative aims to reinvent the ancient Silk Road to connect Asia to Europe and Africa through massive investments in maritime, road and rail projectsEric Olander, managing editor of the non-partisan China Africa Project website, said there is no data to backup claims that BRI worsens debt problems, but US criticism has had an impact.'I think the president wants to change that narrative so he can rebrand and reposition BRI away from the debt issue and more towards China's development story that he wants to tell,' Olander told AFP.Leaders from 37 countries are in Beijing for the three-day forum, with officials from scores of other nations in attendance.Khan, Putin and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, whose country became the first G7 member to sign up to Belt and Road, are among the headliners.EU powers Germany and France have sent ministers to the summit. Putin told leaders attending the conference that China's moves 'fit perfectly into our plans', referring to the Eurasian Economic Union.          Putin called for a global response against protectionism, unilateral sanctions and 'trade wars' - veiled criticisms of the US         Putin told the conference that China's moves 'fit perfectly into our plans', referring to the Eurasian Economic UnionThe Union groups Russia with Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in a common market that seeks to remove barriers to the free movement of goods, services, capital and labor.The five member states 'unanimously supported the idea of linking the construction of the Eurasian Economic Community' and the Belt and Road, Putin said.Separately, Putin met with Xi at Friendship Palace today. He visited Beijing just after wrapping up a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Russia's Far Eastern port city of Vladivostok. Putin called for a global response against protectionism, unilateral sanctions and 'trade wars' - veiled criticisms of the US.With US negotiators heading to China for a new round of trade talks next week, Xi repeated a pledge to increase imports and vowed to abolish 'unjustified' subsidies to Chinese firms - both key US demands.Since Xi launched BRI in 2013, China has invested US$90 billion (£70 billion) in projects while banks have provided upwards of US$300 billion (£232 billion) in loans, according to Chinese officials.          more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  Theresa May insists Conservatives are the real Brexit Party       Watch video  Adorable goat learns to ride on his pony best friend’s back       Watch video  Motorist runs over a police officer after she pulled him over       Watch video  Kerri-Anne Kennerley unleashes on Bill Shorten           Watch video  British Major General Chris Ghika: 'No increased threat from Iran'       Watch video  James Charles stays quiet at LAX amid YouTube drama       Watch video  Two window washers trapped on a swinging lift on top of Oklahoma tower       Watch video  Richer Sounds shows you the range of products they offer           Watch video  Shaman Durek explains his teachings and philosophy       Watch video  Pauline Hanson makes a jibe about Deborah Knight and Today       Watch video  Greens candidate clashes with anti-marriage equality campaigners       Watch video  Excited pup ran over a mile to see his friends at doggy daycare

              The five member states of the Eurasian Economic Union 'unanimously supported the idea of linking the construction of the Eurasian Economic Community' and the Belt and Road, Putin said on Friday         The Union groups Russia with Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in a common market that seeks to remove barriers to the free movement of goods, services, capital and labor. Above, Xi and Putin shake hands at the Tsinghua University ceremony todayBut examples of debt trouble abound.Sri Lanka turned over a deep-sea port to China for 99 years after it was unable to repay loans. Pakistan needs an international bailout.Pushing back has proved a successful election issue in Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Malaysia, as the Chinese project was used to whip up fears about eroding sovereignty.After his electoral victory last May, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad cancelled some planned works and renegotiated a rail project cutting 30 percent off the price tag.But Mahathir said at the summit that 'the Belt and Road idea is great' and he 'fully' supports it.  Britain is committed to help realise the potential of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), British finance minister Philip Hammond said today. Hammond said the BRI must work for everyone for it to turn into a sustainable reality and offered British expertise in project financing. What is the Belt and Road Initiative? Unveiled in 2013 in Kazakhstan and Indonesia by Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Belt and Road Initiative is the most ambitious infrastructure project in modern world history.The multitrillion-dollar initiative involves hundreds of projects, most of them built by Chinese contractors and financed by loans from Chinese state-owned banks, across an arc of 65 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Africa, Europe and the Middle East.         Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping put their palms on a screen during a gas pipeline launching ceremony in Astana in 2013The Belt and Road Initiative, essentially a Modern Silk Road, is made up of a 'belt' of six overland corridors that direct trade to and from China and a maritime 'road' of shipping routes and seaports from the South China Sea to the Indian Ocean.The initiative countries account for 40 per cent of global gross domestic product growth and 44 per cent of the world's population, according to an analysis from Morgan Stanley.As of July 2018, more than 100 countries and international organisations had signed Belt and Road cooperation documents with China, extending the initiative's scope from the Eurasian continent to Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the South Pacific region. The Chinese government calls the initiative 'a bid to enhance regional connectivity and embrace a brighter future'.Other observes and critics, however, see it as a push for the country's position as a global economic power with a China-centered trading network while burying some countries under massive debt.
