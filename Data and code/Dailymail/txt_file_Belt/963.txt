The family seemed to be in a great mood as they made their way through the city.They were coming off a big night in the Big Apple Friday, where they visited Cipriani Wall Street for the 2017 United Nations Correspondents Association Awards, where Angelina accepted the honors for 2017 UNCA Global Citizen of the Year.The Academy Award-winning actress, accepting her honors, said that people have an obligation to envision themselves 'in the struggles of others,' and fight 'their fight for human rights and freedom as your fight,' according to People.                Helping hand: The international star drew looks from onlookers as she helped guide Vivienne         Big honors: Angelina on Friday was awarded with the 2017 UNCA Global Citizen of the Year by the United Nations              Life lessons: Jolie said that she imparts humanitarianism to her children Jolie said that she instills the lessons that guide her ambassadorship into her children.'When people of any race or of any religion are being persecuted and killed we cannot do less than we are capable of doing,' she told the crowd at the swanky Gotham eatery. 'This is what I want my own children to know and value and what I have learned from them.'Children have an understanding and a truth. They can instinctively feel right from wrong. They are not led by strategy they are led by morality.'         Bundled up: The children wore warm sweaters and pants on the icy day in Manhattan          City life: The family walked past a bike route en route to the theater She thanked her kids and said she was beaming with pride over who they're 'growing up to be and for the hope that gives me for the future.'Jolie has not just contributed on an international level, but in a big way in her own industry, as she emerged two months ago to reveal that she was one of the many women producer Harvey Weinstein made unwelcome sexual advances toward, in a hotel room when she was 23 and promoting the 1998 rom-com Playing By Heart.         Silence-breaker: Angelina made headlines in October when she added her name to the list of women alleging sexual misconduct from producer Harvey Weinstein, citing an uncomfortable run-in that occurred nearly two decades back to The New York Times          Wise decision: Angelina said that following the experience, she vowed 'never to work with [Weinstein] again and warn others when they did' of her opinion         Powerful voice: The A-list star said that behavior like Weinstein's 'towards women in any field,' and in 'any country is unacceptable''I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did,' she told The New York Times. 'This behavior towards women in any field, any country is unacceptable.'Weinstein has been accused by a total of 84 women of sexual harassment, misconduct and abuse; his rep has said that 'any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by' the producer.
