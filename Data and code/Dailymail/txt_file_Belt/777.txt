Get your wiggle on in a figure-hugging dress like Amy




Amy Childs Chloe dress
Ruched and fabulous!

Another day another dress. Amy Childs loves to show off that figure doesn't she? But we don't blame her. Her curves are the best in TOWIE. And when you have a whole collection of your own designs, why wouldn't you rock a new one everyday?
This is the Chloe dress (not to be mistaken for an actual Chloe dress), and comes in a variety of colours. Tthe asymmetric shoulder keeps it ultra chic, whilst the side ruching is a clever contouring trick, pulling the focus into the smallest part of your waist. 
Amy loves little wiggle dresses like this. Pencil length is a great cut on her, and we imagine a lot of you women out there too. If you have curves to show off, this frock is an excellent option. 
We aren't mad keen on those white heels she has teamed it with - a red shoe would be daring and interesting - but we can forgive her on the grounds of looking gorgeous in this nude colour. 
You can buy this dress right now from Amy's website, or check out some other options we've found below.
