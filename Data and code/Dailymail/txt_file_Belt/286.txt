 ROME, March 6 (Reuters) - The time is not right for Italy to sign a preliminary deal to become a part of China's giant "Belt and Road" infrastructure plan, Foreign Ministry undersecretary Guglielmo Picchi said on Wednesday. An Italian official said earlier that the government was in talks to sign a memorandum of understanding with China when President Xi Jinping visits the country later this month. However, Picchi, who is a senior member of the ruling League party, wrote on Twitter he thought such a move would be premature. "5G and infrastructural access are issues of national security that must be evaluated with great care. At this moment, I do not think we should proceed with the signature," he wrote.
