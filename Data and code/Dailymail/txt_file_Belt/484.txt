A host of film companies, including Universal, Disney and LucasFilms, backed the project, which is considered critical to the future of screen-based industries in the UK.The site has played temporary home to an esteemed back-catalogue of blockbuster titles including James Bond titles Quantum Of Solace and Skyfall, as well as instalments of the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows series and Abba musical adaptation Mamma Mia!

 The latest instalment of the Star Wars franchise, Episode VII, is currently being filmed at Pinewood.Plans for the site were rejected by the local authority after a flurry of complaints that the development would wreck green belt land and put severe strain on transport networks in the commuter belt.The campaign group said the damage caused to the green belt, as well as damage to the quality of peoples’ lives, significantly outweighed any 'limited and speculative benefits contended' by the applicant.        Several blockbusters, including the James Bond film Quantum of Solace, which starred Daniel Craig, have been filmed at the studios  The proposal involves the demolition of some buildings on the site and the erection of new buildings and facilities across the premises, including a multi-storey car park.Pinewood is the only production complex of its size, scale and international profile in the UK, and its expansion has been deemed pivotal in encouraging growth in the industry.       The latest instalment of Star Wars: Episode VII, which includes Harrison Ford as Han Solo, is currently being filmed at Pinewood  The House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee recently described Pinewood’s contribution as 'enormous', and recognised how knocking back the plans might put scupper future investment. They said: 'A lack of studio space is already resulting in the loss of international inward investment.'Like other studios they need to build capacity if they are to respond to growing demand. We expect demand for studio space to grow significantly with the introduction of tax credits for high-end television.'While allowing for local concerns, the planning system should adequately recognise the significance of creative industry infrastructure.'According to a Government report, the project would secure private sector investment of nearly £200 million, and the creation of 99,000sqm of new sound stages, workshops, production suites and associated production tenant office accommodation.It would also create around 3,100 additional jobs, and described the case for expansion as 'compelling and robust'.Pinewood has housed more than 1,500 films, while its television studios have shot Dancing On Ice, Dragons’ Den, BBC sitcom My Family, Piers Morgan’s Life Stories and entertainment show Ant & Dec’s Push The Button.
