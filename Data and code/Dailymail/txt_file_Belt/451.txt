Apparently taking a cue from former chief minister and BSP supremo Mayawati, the Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh has decided to promote its election symbol — the bicycle — in a big way. Mayawati had glorified her party symbol — the elephant — with a 33-acre concrete park on a public forest. But it seems the local administration in Ghaziabad got it all wrong and goofed up on the very core of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav’s “go green” message.          The ‘green toll’ may run into thousands of trees as Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav’s ambitious “go cycling” plan is to be implemented in all cities across Uttar PradeshTasked with promoting the non-motorised mode of transport, the local administration is set to destroy kilometres of roadside green belt. It has already felled at least 500 trees in the Kavi Nagar area. The ‘green toll’ may run into thousands of trees as the chief minister’s ambitious “go cycling” plan is to be implemented in all cities across UP. “Thousands of trees will have to be cut to execute this proposal,” a Kavi Nagar resident said.

Share this article Share   When Mail Today contacted GDA’s chief engineer V.K. Goyal, he claimed these were not green belts: “If you set up a lawn in front of your house, does that become a green belt?” But when confronted with the affidavits filed in the NGT, he said: “The corporation officials are not knowledgeable and show anything in courts.” He retorted: “As per court orders, no polythene is to be used. Is UP polythene-free?” Green belt          But the residents are not pleased by the felling of trees along the green belt. The varieties of felled trees include eucalyptus, neem, peepul, pilkhan, bargad and jamun, some of them fully grown. Locals wonder if the “cycle political advertisement” is more important than the trees that protect the township from the everincreasing pollution. Ruchin Mehra, an environmentalist, said: “The move is surprising because the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation itself has marked these roadside stretches as ‘green belts’ in various affidavits to the National Green Tribunal. "The state’s tree cover has been assessed on the basis of these affidavits. "There are specific guidelines from the high court and Supreme Court that the green belts cannot be concretised. "How can they just erase the green stretch and set up cycle tracks there?” Ghaziabad municipal deputy commissioner S.K. Tiwari said: “We greened those stretches to avoid encroachment and pollution but GDA takes the final call on what is a green belt, residential or commercial area.” When pointed out that this translates into lack of coordination between government departments and wastage of public money, he said: “Trees have to give way for development.” Rajendar Tyagi, a four-time councillor of Raj Nagar, ex-GDA board member and ex-Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation vice-president, claimed these were only money-minting tactics. “If they were so concerned about building cycle tracks, they should have used the service roads in Kavi Nagar. "The cycle tracks created earlier are now dotted with shops and kiosks. The more concretisation you do, the more contracts are there for minting money.” Build tracks The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has drawn up a plan to build cycle tracks in the Kavi Nagar area. The tracks will run from Vivekanand Nagar Crossing to Raj Nagar flyover; Raj Nagar flyover to Sanjay Nagar ALT flyover and from Sanjay Nagar ALT flyover to Hapur Chungi. Worth more than Rs 12 crore, the tracks will be 17.6-km long. Pramod Choudhary, a retired vet, said: “There was a time when this road used to be littered with fallen jamuns but, just a month later, there are only tree stumps here. "Ghaziabad is polluted, the air is dirty, groundwater is going down and population is increasing. "If they continue to tile the open spaces, how will groundwater be recharged and, in the absence of trees, how will the air be cleaned?” Golf course in forest area The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) seems to have a strong displeasure for naturally grown forests and loves to replace them with manicured lawns. Recently, the Allahabad High Court ordered GDA to stop all construction work and maintain status quo in the matter of ‘Sai Upvan’ after the residents of an upscale society in Indirapuram filed a Public Interest Litigation. This was a city forest with thousand of trees which GDA allowed to be flooded with sewage water from drains and river Hindon and declared that it would be developed into a golf course.          “Sai Upvan had thousands of trees. All of them died over two years because of sewage overflowing into the forest area,” said Alok Kumar, the petitioner (pictured: stagnant sewage water at Sai Upwan)Also known as ‘Kanha Upvan’, a 32.5 hectares forestland, it is marked as ‘City Forest’ in the GDA’s 2021 Master Plan. “Sai Upvan had thousands of trees. All of them died over two years because of sewage overflowing into the forest area,” said Alok Kumar, the petitioner. “Instead of correcting the situation, plugging the leaking sewage drains and preventing them from pouring their contents into the forest, the authorities decided to build a golf course there,” he added. GDA and the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation stated that the decision to convert Sai Upvan into a golf course was taken in a meeting in June. As per terms of reference, all profits generated from the golf course would be shared between them in a ratio of 60:40. The petition alleged that earlier the GDA and the municipal corporation embarked upon a group housing scheme in the forest area but it failed to take off for some reasons. Then it came up with the golf course plan. “The authorities are not supposed to use the land available at its disposal in any which way but judiciously to ensure the right kind of development. "By clearing the forest and declaring it for a commercial use, it violated its own Master Plan which clearly said it is City Forest,” said Kumar. Akhilesh on track to garner votes          Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is leaving no stone unturned in wooing the massesUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has one thing in common with Mayawati. He is leaving no stone unturned in wooing the masses, with the imprint of his party’s symbol across the state ahead of the 2017 Assembly elections.In its previous regime (2002–2007), former chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav had started construction of an approximately 8 km cycle track from the CM’s residence crossing to Polytechnic crossing in state capital Lucknow. However, it remained partially incomplete and untouched during the Mayawati regime (2007–2012). Now his son Akhilesh has decided to carry on his father’s dream project and the Public Works Department has started work on it in some cities. In Lucknow, the existing cycle track has been revamped and work is on in other stretches.“The earlier cycle track had iron grills and railings on both sides. "But the railings have been removed, as these could have injured a cyclist suffering a fall,” a PWD official said.“The PWD has shortlisted the posh Vikramaditya Marg, 5 Kalidas Marg and the stretch between Golf Course and La Martiniere College for this. "The tracks will be complete by January next year,” he added. Despite the government not announcing any budget, the PWDs of these cities are chalking out track plans.According to PWD officials, each cycle track will be a 2.5-metre wide strip of bitumen that will be guided by bricks, bearing a special red colour coding.Etawah Chief Development Officer Ashok Chandra said: “Though the route is not chalked out, we will begin construction in Etawah after the four-lane road between Etawah and Mainpuri is complete.
