'It's all affected by social media. That's what life is now. And it's going to advance more and more. That what it's going to be about.'Seja, who lives in Fresno - 140 miles away from her girlfriend in Stockton - says the distance hadn't stopped their relationship and Jacqueline would pick her up every weekend.

She was in the custody of Child Protective Services the past two years, he added.Family members have started a GoFundMe Page for Jacqueline's funeral expenses. Facebook has been repeatedly accused of failing to remove graphic and unsuitable content. In April it announced it was hiring 3,000 more staff to monitor posts.  Rob Carroll, a chief deputy in the Merced County District Attorney's Office, said he expects the video will be a key piece of evidence.'Drinking, driving and driving erratically - obviously those are poor choices,' Carroll said.Neither Obdulia Sanchez nor an attorney representing her could be reached for comment.
