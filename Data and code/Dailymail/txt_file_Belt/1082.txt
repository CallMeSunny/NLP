The green belt is being ‘gobbled up at an alarming rate’ to build thousands of homes, a report warns today.Analysis shows councils in England have removed protections from land, opening the way for the development of hundreds of thousands of homes.Green belt land can only be built on in exceptional circumstances.And earlier this year Theresa May reaffirmed the Government’s commitment to protecting the ‘green lungs’ of our cities, saying ‘the answer to our housing crisis does not lie in tearing up the green belt’.But a report by the Campaign to Protect Rural England today shows plans for almost 460,000 homes have been pencilled in for green belt land by councils since 2013.

Both methods have been used to erode the green belt, the report said. Between 2011/12 and 2016/17 nearly 4,900 hectares of green belt have lost their protected status in local plans – the equivalent of a city the size of Middlesbrough, housing ministry figures show.The report said that in the past four years, 11,000 hectares of green belt land – a city the size of Bristol – have also been built on for industrial, commercial or residential purposes. Of this 7,200 were undeveloped ‘greenfield’ land.Last year alone the equivalent of nearly 400 football pitches of untouched greenfield were built on for flats or houses in England.

 The pace of development in the green belt is accelerating. Only 70 houses or flats were built in the green belt in 2009/10 compared with 8,143 in 2017/18. Of these, 3,300 were on greenfield sites.Today’s CPRE report, The State of the Green Belt, said: ‘Our key findings show that the Government has broken its promise to secure the green belt.’Virgin greenfield land is preferred by developers as it is easy to build on. But the CPRE said there was no need to pave over the countryside when there are sufficient urban ‘brownfield’ sites in towns and cities that could provide some 720,000 homes.Brownfield sites include wasteland, derelict or disused sites such as old warehouses or factories.The CPRE said that over the past six years ‘too many local authorities and developers have been taking a lax view of what exceptional means... allocating green belt sites for development as an easy option rather than as a last resort.’         Today’s CPRE report, The State of the Green Belt, said: ‘Our key findings show that the Government has broken its promise to secure the green belt' (Protesters in Borehamwood campaigning against development on green belt land)The CPRE also calculated that of the homes built on the green belt in the past nine years, 72 per cent were not ‘affordable’ under the Government’s definitions, so they do little to reduce the housing shortage.Critics fear it may become even easier to build on green belt land.Last year the Government unveiled its Housing White Paper containing ambitious plans to build a million new homes by 2020. It said the green belt would not lose any of its protections. But critics noted ‘exceptional circumstances’ could include housing requirements – in effect watering down safeguards.Tom Fyans, of the CPRE, said: ‘We are being sold a lie by many developers. As they sell off and gobble up the green belt to build low-density, unaffordable housing, young families go on struggling to afford a place to live.‘The affordable housing crisis must be addressed with increasing urgency, while acknowledging that far from providing the solution, building on the green belt only serves to entrench the issue. The Government is failing in its commitment to protect the green belt – it is being eroded at an alarming rate.’The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ‘We are clear building the homes our country needs does not mean tearing up our countryside.‘Last year the number of new homes built was the highest in a decade, and only 0.02 per cent of the green belt was developed for residential use.‘We are adding more certainty to the planning system and our new rulebook strengthens national protections for the green belt.’   We're fighting to half houses here... public services just cannot copeby Sami QuadriHundreds of residents have launched a campaign to stop new houses and a school being built on green belt land near their homes.They have taken to the streets with placards and chanted ‘Hands off green belt!’ in a demonstration against the development that would bring 58 houses and a primary school.         Hundreds of residents have launched a campaign to stop new houses and a school being built on green belt land near their homes in Borehamwood Claire Crossan, 61, said the building project in Well End, near Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, will do little to help people get on the housing ladder, while putting pressure on public services. ‘It will without doubt put a strain on public services,’ said Mrs Crossan, who leads the Well End Ers group. ‘People are screaming for hospital appointments.‘The roads are congested, Borehamwood doesn’t have any infrastructure.‘It was well-known for being a semi-rural place but we’re getting very overcrowded.’ Mrs Crossan and her group are dismayed that land currently used for farming, which is popular with families, dog walkers and horse riders, will be lost.She said of the national move towards 460,000 new homes on green belt land: ‘These figures are disappointing and lots of rural parts of the country will be hit hard by this, including mine.’
