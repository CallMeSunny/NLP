Be a biker chick in Yolanda's Versace jacket




Versace colour block leather jacket




Visit site



The Hadid family are a stylish lot, aren't they? 
There's Gigi and Bella who are arguably the most in-demand models out there right now but who are equally known for their fashion-forward streetstyle. Clearly they got it from their mama, because Yolanda is always impeccably dressed too.
In fact, the lucky things obviously share wardrobes because we've spotted Gigi in these exact zip booties by Versace... and this exact Versace jacket!
We love this colour-bock take on a biker style  which gives it a statement vibe and as Yolanda shows, immediately adds some edge to your outfit.
Fancy joining the Hadids? You can steal a slice of their style, at least, by getting your hands on this Versace jacket. It doesn't come cheap  though, for those without a supermodel's salary...
So if you can't splash out, just get the look instead with our colour-block picks below from Missguided, Chloé and Kaleidoscope, or keep it classic with Jaeger's timeless black style!
