 The song first opens in Mandarin, then introduces Zhang Qian, the Chinese official and diplomat who served as an imperial envoy to the world outside of China in the late 2nd century BC during the Han dynasty. Zhang was considered the pioneer of the ancient Silk Road, which has connected China and Europe economically and politically through trade.'Two thousand years ago / Zhang Qian was ready to go,' a female voice rapped. 'Carrying a mission of peace ... Silk, tea, and chinaware/ In Asia, Europe, and Africa / Friends from the continents / Let us join hands.'          The song introduces Zhang Qian, the Chinese official and diplomat who served as an imperial envoy to the world outside of China during the Han dynasty. He is illustrated in this screengrab leading a leading a herd of camels carrying goods through the Gobi Desert         Performed in English by an actor and one of the news agency's reporters, the three-minute clip is part of the Chinese government's efforts to promote its £6 trillion globalisation project         The song carries on to unpack the virtues the various countries could gain from the projectA cartoon animation of Zhang, leading a herd of camels carrying goods, is seen battling the sandstorms of north China's Gobi Desert from Chang'an city, the ancient capital city of the country and also the eastern terminal of the Silk Road.The clip then enters the chorus: 'Belt and Road, is no enterprise solo / Belt and Road, is the world's ensemble / It's the Belt and Road, it's new and old / It's opportune for all so bold.'A girl is seen walking among flashy animations and collages of shipping ports, cargo containers and different international landmarks.A narration then explains: 'B&R is the acronym used for the Belt and Road Initiative which was proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013. It includes the Silk Road, Economic Belt, and the 21st century Maritime Silk Road.'          Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping put their palms on a screen during a gas pipeline launching ceremony in Astana September 7, 2013         Many international freight trains begin its trade routes from Xi'an Railway Cargo Container Center (pictured), within the framework of China's Belt and Road InitiativeFirst proposed in 2013 in Kazakhstan and Indonesia by Xi, the massive trade and infrastructure project aims to link China to 65 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Africa, Europe and the Middle East.The project is expected to cost between US$4 trillion (£3 trillion) to US$8 trillion (£6 trillion), according to CGTN. The song carries on to unpack the economic and cultural virtues the countries could gain from the project: 'Peace and health / Wealth and gold / Bring affluence to all.' 'Renew the Silk Road, make dreams come true,' the song reiterated.  Last month at a two-day China-Africa summit, Xi pledged US$60 billion (£46 billion) worth of funding to several nations under the Belt and Road initiative. The money - to be spent over the next three years - came on top of US$60 billion Beijing offered in 2015.          Chinese President Xi Jinping (centre) with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa (left) and Senegalese President Macky Sall (right) at the China-Africa summit in Beijing in September         Chinese President Xi Jinping with South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and Senegal's President Macky Sall as they attend the 2018 Beijing Summit of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation joint news conference at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on September 4Xi stressed that Beijing's investment in Africa comes with 'no political strings attached,' - contrary to what critics has suggested. This is not Beijng's first time to creatively promote the government's agenda to a younger audience as well as present a friendlier image to the world through cringeworthy songs.Last May, state-run China Daily uploaded the song 'The Belt and Road is How' on YouTube, featuring the children supposedly from countries involved in the project. In 2016, Chinese state media put out the rap song, 'Karl Marx is a post-90', to promote Communist theories to youngsters.What is the Belt and Road Initiative? Unveiled in 2013 in Kazakhstan and Indonesia by Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Belt and Road Initiative is the most ambitious infrastructure project in modern world history.The multitrillion-dollar initiative involves hundreds of projects, most of them built by Chinese contractors and financed by loans from Chinese state-owned banks, across an arc of 65 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Africa, Europe and the Middle East.         Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping put their palms on a screen during a gas pipeline launching ceremony in Astana in 2013The Belt and Road Initiative, essentially a Modern Silk Road, is made up of a 'belt' of six overland corridors that direct trade to and from China and a maritime 'road' of shipping routes and seaports from the South China Sea to the Indian Ocean.The initiative countries account for 40 per cent of global gross domestic product growth and 44 per cent of the world's population, according to an analysis from Morgan Stanley.As of July 2018, more than 100 countries and international organisations had signed Belt and Road cooperation documents with China, extending the initiative's scope from the Eurasian continent to Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the South Pacific region. The Chinese government calls the initiative 'a bid to enhance regional connectivity and embrace a brighter future'.Other observes and critics, however, see it as a push for the country's position as a global economic power with a China-centered trading network while burying some countries under massive debt.
