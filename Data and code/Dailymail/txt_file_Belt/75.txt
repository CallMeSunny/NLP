 BEIJING, May 12 (Reuters) - Chinese investments related to its Belt and Road initiative since 2013 total $60 billion, an official at the state planning agency said on Friday. Scrutiny of outbound investments by Chinese regulators will not affect Belt and Road projects, Ning Jizhe, a vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, told a news conference. The Chinese government is promoting outbound investment in Belt and Road projects, but at the same time has cracked down on what it calls "irrational" investments, which led overall outbound direct investment from China to fall by 49 percent in the first quarter.
