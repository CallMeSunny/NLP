'The tax rises and reduction in public spending announced in the recent budget will inevitably put further pressure on unemployment levels, reduce disposable incomes and constrain consumer confidence,' the company said. The firm welcomed Mr Osborne's decision to scrap the previous Government's 10 per cent hike on cider duty, but was 'disappointed' that the above-inflation rises planned on beer duty remain in place. Punch also warned the VAT hike to 20 per cent looming in January 'will put further unnecessary pressure on the pub trade' and hoped the measure would be 'rebalanced in the future'. Meanwhile, plans to invest in 800 pubs across its tenanted estate by the year end are on track and support to struggling landlords remains stable at £2 million a month, although a squeeze on drinks margins has kept profits under pressure. Punch's net debt now stands at £3.2 billion, helped by disposals expected to generate £300 million over the full year. The group has reduced debt by £664 million since the start of the financial year. Seymour Pierce analyst Hugh-Guy Lorriman said the tone of the statement 'is more positive than has been the case for Punch over the last two years'. But he warned: 'Looking in more detail at the statement we do not believe that the underlying long term trend has moved into the growth momentum that the business needs to provide sustainable growth in value for equity holders.' Former Marks & Spencer finance director Ian Dyson joins the firm as its new chief executive in September, replacing Giles Thorley.
