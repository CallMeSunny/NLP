It’s a first for the UFC this week, as this season’s winner of The Ultimate Fighter gets an instant crack at undisputed flyweight king Demetrious Johnson in Las Vegas.The champion’s dominance in the division saw the promotion bring in 16 125lb belt holders from MMA organisations across the world for the 24th installment of the popular reality series.Ex-UFC fighter Tim Elliot was crowned the eventual winner on Wednesday night. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the American’s chances and the rest of the contests on the finale’s main card, previewing the Saturday night fights.         Demetrious Johnson (left), posed with a relaxed looking Tim Means ahead of their fight          Johnson (right) has looked almost invincible during his reign as the featherweight king   Demetrious Johnson (24-2-1) vs Tim Elliot (10-6-1)Elliot enters this title fight looking to pull off one of the biggest upsets in UFC history.The 29-year-old’s success on TUF marks an incredible career turnaround, having been cut from the UFC just 18 months ago.He notched up a 4-2 record during his three-year stint in the company but a hat-trick of defeats saw him sent on his way.However, Elliot’s fighting days were far from over as he joined Titan FC, quickly becoming their inaugural flyweight champion and defending twice before an opportunity to compete under the UFC banner once more came calling.         Johnson is regarded the best pound-for-pound fighter in the entire organisation  WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE FIGHTER?    - Reality show features fighters living together and fighting each other, the winner gaining a UFC contract- Programme began as a way to raise interest in mixed martial arts and the UFC- Fighters are coached in teams by two existing UFC combatants in their division- Former winners include: Michael Bisping, Nate Diaz, Rashad Evans, Roy Nelson, Tony Ferguson and most recently Tim Elliot- This is the first edition of the show where the winner has been given an immediate title shot - There have been 24 seasons of show which has helped take sport mainstream   The American was earmarked as one of the early favourites for the tournament and was selected as the first overall pick by flyweight contender Joseph Benavidez, one of two team coaches, and a man to whom he once lost.And he lived up to that tag, using his unique brawling style to best Charlie Alaniz, Matt Schnell, Eric Shelton and Hiromasa Ogikubo and earn a title shot that once seemed implausible.However, with all due respect to those four, the UFC’s most dominant active champion presents an altogether different challenge.Johnson, undefeated in the weight class, won the flyweight strap in September 2012 against Benavidez and has defended it no less than eight times. No other current UFC title holder has defended on more than four occasions.The fact that the UFC had to look outside their own roster for a new challenger tells you all you need to know.His performances, embodied by quick striking and elusive movement, have seen him rise to No 1 in the official pound-for-pound rankings and it’s hard to see past him staying there after this weekend.  Joseph Benavidez (24-4-0) vs Henry Cejudo (10-1-0)Two men that know better than anyone of Johnson’s octagon prowess are this season’s TUF coaches, the aforementioned Benavidez and Henry Cejudo.The two top flyweight contenders go head-to-head in the co-main event looking to settle their differences after a tense rivalry on the show.Benavidez, whose team ultimately came out victorious, has established himself as one of the best lower weight fighters in the world, his only four losses coming in pairs to bantamweight champion Dominic Cruz and the imperious Johnson.         Joseph Benavidez (left) and Henry Cejudo coached in the latest Ultimate Fighter series With Johnson having essentially cleaned out the division, Benavidez, a wrestling and submission specialist that can get it done on the feet, will be hoping earn himself a rare third go at the champ.Cejudo, Johnson’s most recent victim, has similar plans.The 29-year-old, who won a gold medal in freestyle wrestling at the 2008 Olympic Games, saw his 10-fight undefeated streak brought to an end when he was finished inside the first round by the champion back in April.

 There has been no love lost between the pair during the series with Cejudo constantly criticising his rival for failing to act like a role model.‘I feel like he makes a fool of himself a lot, basically talking about himself,’ Benavidez said in response. ‘He's so corny and serious and almost fake with all that generic stuff.‘The thing that annoyed me was he tried to make it more about himself. We're just different. He takes himself way too seriously for my liking."         Jake Ellenberger (left) will take on Jorge Masvidal in a high profile encounter also on the card   Jake Ellenberger (31-1-1-0) vs Jorge Masvidal (30-11-0)Topping the rest of the card is a clash between experienced welterweights Jake Ellenberger and Jorge Masvidal.Heavy hitting Ellenberger’s career had looked to be winding down but the 31-year-old ended a run of four defeats in five with a stunning first round knockout of ‘The Immortal’ Matt Brown at UFC 201, earning himself a ‘Performance of the Night’ bonus.He will need to be careful, however, if he is to continue his renaissance against the more technically sound Masvidal, who, despite inconsistent results, has proven a tough test for everyone he has come up against in the division.         Jake Ellenberger (left) arrested his recent slide with a dominant win over Matt Brown   Ion Cutelaba (12-2-0) vs Jared Cannonier (8-1-0)The light heavyweights are up next, as Moldovan youngster Ion Cutelaba looks to make a name for himself against Alaskan Jared Cannonier.Cannonier drops down from heavyweight for this fight having destroyed Cyril Asker in his last contest.He takes on fellow striker Cutelaba, 10 years his junior, in what promises to be an explosive bout.           Sara McMann (9-3-0) vs Alexis Davis (16-6-0)Former No 3 bantamweight Alexis Davis makes her return following pregnancy against former US Olympian Sara McMann.Davis, whose 18-month hiatus has seen her drop out of the rankings, will be looking to get herself back on the path to title contention, having lost to Ronda Rousey in 16 seconds on her first attempt.McCann, who coincidentally joined the UFC on the same day as Davis four years ago, will aim to use her world-class wrestling to stop her in her tracks.
