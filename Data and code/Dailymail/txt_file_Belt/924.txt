   'I'm so excited to have the chance to unify the division. Jorge is a fantastic fighter and it's another mountain to climb, but these are the tests that I thrive on and I've beaten two great fighters in Perez and Barroso and I'm confident that I can beat Jorge, too.'I'm having to pinch myself after everything that's happened. I'm fighting the number one fighter in the division for the WBC, WBA and THE RING title; it doesn't get any better than this.          Crolla hailed the fight as a clash between 'the best in the world' and said 'it doesn't get any better than this'         The WBA champions said he was 'very proud and privileged to be able to bring this fight to Manchester''I'm very proud and privileged to be able to bring this fight to Manchester.'He's known to fight fans over here because of his fantastic fight with Kevin Mitchell, so it seemed a natural fight to make. Linares is a fantastic fighter. Technically, he's brilliant and I'm a fan of his. Like all fighters, though, he's got vulnerabilities and I plan to take advantage of those.Linares has not fought since the victory over Mitchell, but Crolla expects him to be fully fit when the pair meet in September. 'He wouldn't be in that ring unless he was 100%. It'll be almost 12 months since his last fight by the time we fight which isn't ideal, but he's someone who looks after himself - you can see that from social media. I don't see that being a factor.         Linares' last fight in the UK came against Kevin Mitchell, and he has not fought anywhere since         Linares was stripped of his belt after failing to fight a mandatory challenger due to a hand injury'I'm coming off two career-best performances. Before the first fight with Darleys Perez, I'd been out of the ring for a period of time but as long as you live a good life then I don't believe ring rust is an issue.''Last time, it was a special atmosphere but this time we are going to top that. I really believe that.'I hope people want to be part of that atmosphere because I'm very fortunate the way they come out. This time will be an even better atmosphere and hopefully it'll be another memorable night.'Linares has seen a lot but he won't have experienced anything like this.'
