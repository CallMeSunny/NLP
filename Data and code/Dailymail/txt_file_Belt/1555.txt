 But then suddenly one of the officers - with his bare hands - pulls on the glass window and smashes it.Fisher-Herrera had already rang 911 to request another officer as she feared the polices’ intentions.She can be heard shouting, ‘don’t break his arm’ as the officer tries to drag Page from his vehicle - with the seat belt obstructing their way.         Phillip Page was dragged out of the vehicle for not wearing a seatbelt after he argued the officers had not asked for his licence and registrationThe video, published on Facebook this week but first filmed in February, shows a police officer shouting ‘You’re under goddamn arrest!’ as Page is thrown to the ground.Yet State Police say the officers were in the right since the driver refused to comply for more than 15 minutes before his window was forcefully broken.A spokesperson for New Mexico State Police told the newspaper that Page refused to give his identification 14 times and was warned at least eight times that if he failed to roll down his window they would break it and arrest him. New Mexico State Police Chief Pete Kassetas said after investigating that the force believes Page could have avoided the incident if he ‘followed the rules’.         Angela Fisher-Herrera filmed the officers from the passenger seat of the car and can be heard shouting 'don't break his arm'‘I’m standing by my officers,’ he said. ‘At some point after a certain amount of time of noncompliance, something has to happen.’‘We didn’t break the window and drag him out of the car because he didn’t have a seat belt on,’ he said. ‘He got removed from the vehicle forcefully because he didn’t comply.’‘I was just doing everything that was within my rights,’ Page said.Both the motorist and the passenger were arrested for resisting, evading or obstructing an officer, concealing identity, dialling 911 to report a false alarm or complaint, and a seat belt violation. Page, who now lives in Oregon, told the Journal he hopes the case will be dismissed.
