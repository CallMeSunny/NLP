It is a woman's world after all: Having an X ray, ultrasound or mammogram no longer has to feel like being on a conveyor belt  By Ritu Bhatia   Published: 00:48 BST, 27 June 2013  |  Updated: 00:48 BST, 27 June 2013                e-mail          View  comments         Angelina Jolie, pictured last week at the Al Zaatri refugee camp for displaced Syrians in Jordan, spoke out about her breast cancer scare earlier this year - demonstrating how vital it is for women to have annual check-ups The temptation to skip portions of the annual medical checkup always looms: Why bother with the cholesterol, you think, I don't eat fried stuff anyway; anyone who drinks as much milk as me surely doesn't need a bone scan…. The justifications are endless. But this year, there was no way of avoiding the mammogram and pap smear, what with Angelina Jolie's breast cancer scare and Michael Douglas's oral sex - human papilloma virus (HPV) drama. So I scheduled an appointment with a highly recommended gynaecologist. She suggested I go for a 'Pap Duo' which combines the HPV test and pap smear, a sort of double whammy. Sounded scary, but I said yes, in a brave moment. Dr. U.P Jah also suggested I go for a 'high resolution' mammogram instead of the regular one. 'When we have access to the best technology, why not avail of it,' suggested Dr. Jah. Why not indeed? I loved her already. It turns out that Mahajan Imaging is the only clinic in town that has the machine for the recommended 'high resolution' scan. An hour after I set up an appointment, I was surprised by a call from the receptionist. 'Madam, this is to let you know that there's a male technician on duty at the time of your appointment…I hope you are comfortable with this?' It took a few seconds to get over my wonder (is this for real, a clinic that's actually sensitive to women?), before I requested a new appointment. X rays, ultrasound examinations and mammograms have become routine tests and there's no getting away from the feeling of being on conveyor belt each time you need one. You sit around in a room with grim looking men and women clutching reports. Then your name is called out and you are sent off into a dark chamber and asked to disrobe in front of the technician. What follows can be a nerve-wracking experience, especially when you aren't warned that you will be smeared with ice-cold gel, or that a mammogram really hurts. The gel inevitably stains your clothes, the mammogram jars, and you emerge feeling messy and sore.       Taking note: The woman's movement has finally started to make an impact in medical centres across India It's even worse if you have downed several litres of water mandatory for pelvic exams – you're bound to end up standing in a line for the toilet with other desperate folks whose bladders are also bursting. Another uncomfortable experience for any woman who needs a checkup is donning the mandatory 'hospital' gown. You are handed this pale looking garment with instructions to wear absolutely nothing beneath. Oops! These gowns are poorly designed, with flaps in the front that make them easy to open when the doctor needs to do an examination. Only, nobody takes the fact that you are naked underneath into account. Aside from providing everyone a peep show to anyone who glances your way, you can't stop shivering in the highly air-conditioned environment.

Share this article Share   Naturally, I was full of trepidation when I entered Mahajan's clinic. Various forms were handed to me for filling and I was told to drink plenty of water. The room was crammed with others like me. But the wait was short and the ultrasound room actually had a partition and curtain, allowing for some privacy. I can't remember any other occasion when I have actually had the privilege of taking off my clothes alone and lying down peacefully, for an ultrasound exam! Disposable napkins were provided to wipe off the gel and the nurse even suggested I use the sheet to wipe off the excess. The doctor actually smiled, engaged in a conversation and patiently responded to my queries. Better still, I didn't have to queue up for the toilet. It's not over yet. The 'Pap duo' results are due and another visit to Dr Jha's clinic is also on the itinerary. But nothing can take away from the thrill of my discovery that the women's movement is finally making its presence felt in medical settings. All we need now is a hospital gown designed by Ritu Kumar.  Gandolfini death is a wake up call for men The untimely death of charismatic 51-year-old actor James Gandolfini from cardiac arrest should sound off alarm bells for Indian men, who are genetically predisposed to heart disease. Best known for his portrayal of criminal Tony Soprano in HBO's landmark series, The Sopranos, Gandolfini died while on a vacation with his family.      Wake up call: James Gandolfini, pictured with his Emmy Award for Lead Actor in a Drama Series' category for his role in The Sopranos, died from a heart attackAn autopsy confirmed heart attack, even though he had no history of heart disease. He was, however, at high risk, evident from the girth of his stomach. Heart attacks are becoming common among younger Indian men, says Dr Ashok Seth, chairman, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute. 'Such events are common, as is florid heart disease in 40 year old men these days,' says Dr. Seth. Symptoms of heart disease are often absent, making it imperative to have regular checkups. Even those without risk factors must get their lipid and cholesterol checks from the age of 30, and stress exercise testing from the age of 40. His advice to those with major risk factors is to begin testing at age 25. Prevention really is the best motto. Pack a healthy punch It's taken a few mouthfuls of some new cutlets I discovered to change my view that healthy and yummy aren't synonymous with each other. The Balinese Bean Bites and Beet & Walnut Bites created by The Temperamental Chef are delicious and offer proof that healthy can indeed be tasty. These uniquely flavoured snacks are nutritious and low calorie and can be baked instead of fried. Company owners Srishti Handa and Siddharth Kumar came up with the recipe together. 'Being a vegetarian, I felt the market needed snacking options aside from potatoes and panneer,' says Srishti. Look out for these at high-end food stores across the city. Yolks and whites Ever wondered why the white of your egg is cloudy or clear? Or why egg yolks vary in colour from deep to pale yellow? It turns out that older eggs have clearer whites while fresh eggs have milky, opaque whites. The colour of egg yolks, however, reflects the quality of chicken feed. A richer feed makes for deeper yellow yolks while the eggs from a chicken fed a lighter feed have paler yolks.
