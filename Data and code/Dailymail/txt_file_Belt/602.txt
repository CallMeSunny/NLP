More WA public sector 'efficiencies' ahead By Australian Associated Press   Published: 10:34 BST, 27 February 2015  |  Updated: 10:34 BST, 27 February 2015                e-mail         Facing three straight deficits, West Australian Treasurer Mike Nahan says there's "great scope" for more belt tightening in the public sector.Dr Nahan told a business briefing on Friday the state budget was still heading for the red after about a 50 per cent plunge in the iron ore price during the past 12 months."People ask me how low it can go ... I fear to answer," he said.But there was no need to panic because there was still room to claw back cash from public sector "efficiencies", he said.And he's confident the Commonwealth Grants Commission will consider WA's demands for a greater share of the GST."I think the time is right ... and I've got good feedback from the Commonwealth government, but I haven't banked it yet and it's yet to be achieved," Dr Nahan later told reporters.He disagreed little headway had been made in the fight to secure more tax revenue."For the last two years, the treasurer - first Wayne Swan and then Joe Hockey - overrode the Grants Commission on the system for iron ore fines."It provided an additional $350 million."By the way, that's not factored into our forward estimates."Dr Nahan said he had "no doubt" there would be change after the usual five-year review by the commission now under way.
