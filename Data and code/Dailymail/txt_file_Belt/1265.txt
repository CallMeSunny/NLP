Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw will be much more relaxed when he leads his side out against France at Murrayfield today — but that is not because he finally got a Six Nations victory under his belt with a win over Italy.The success in Rome did ease the pressure on Laidlaw, who had been skipper for nine straight Six Nations defeats before that victory.But the other reason for him lightening up is the influence of stand-off Finn Russell, whose happy go-lucky nature has helped his captain chill out.         Greig Laidlaw admits that Finn Russell has been a calming influence for him in the dressing room and on pitchBefore games when tension is high in the dressing room, the 23-year-old Glasgow Warriors star remains totally relaxed.That demeanour doesn’t signify indifference to the outcome of a game, but shows he has everything in perspective, treating triumph and disaster on the pitch in the same manner.Laidlaw admits he never had that same laid-back approach until his half-back partner came on the scene.The pair have played together for the last year and a half, with Russell’s carefree approach to the game rubbing off on him.         ‘At times, I can be serious but Finn helps me lighten up,’ said the Scotland captain. ‘I love playing alongside him as he is a natural rugby player and a natural leader.‘He plays with a youthful exuberance and he has helped spark me. He cares, but doesn’t feel too much pressure.‘Of course, there is always pressure being captain of Scotland, but you can’t take it on to the pitch and Finn has helped me realise that.’As well as remaining calm in the dressing room beforehand, Laidlaw will spend a few moments before he goes out to remind himself of the sheer honour and responsibility he has as Scotland captain.

It will remind me of how big an honour it is to captain my country,’ added Laidlaw.Earlier in the week, Sportsmail caught up with Laidlaw at Bishopton Rugby Club where he took training sessions for youngsters and held a question-and-answer sessions for the club members.         Glasgow Warriors star Russell has partnered the Scotland skipper for the past year and a halfBishopton had been shaken by the death of a teenage player Mathew Seymour in 2014.Since then, his team and family have been determined to give Matthew a rugby legacy in setting up a successful trust fund in association with charity Cardiac Risk in the Young, working together to support his friends and the wider community by involving them in their rugby club.They hosted a cardiac screening session, which Laidlaw visited.‘Bishopton is a superb club. It shows the positive effect rugby clubs can have on the wider communtiy,’ he said.
