Copy Katy in a jumpsuit by Zuhair Murad

The Grammy Awards may be all about the music, but for us it's really all about the clothes.
And not only did we have the awards show's red carpet to obsess over but there were after parties too, meaning costume changes for stars like Katy Perry who switched up her look as she attended the Universal shindig.
Earlier in the evening she sparkled in a sequin top and feather skirt by Tom Ford but she was more understated in this jumpsuit by Zuhair Murad. We love the double breasted button detail and tailoring at the waist while the plunging neckline and split legs add acres of sex appeal.
The good news is you can buy this all-in-one now. Click (right) to snap it up at Farfetch and style with a pair of high heel sandals on your next big night out. Or get the look for less with our edit below.
