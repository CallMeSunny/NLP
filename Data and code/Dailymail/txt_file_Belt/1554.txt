 All three defendants in the abuse case were jailed Monday after failing to post bail. Court documents don't list a defense attorney who could speak on their behalf.The children were placed in the home by Luzerne County Children and Youth Services in December 2011 but weren't removed until December 2017.It is not clear why the children were left for so long or whether an investigation into the handling of their case has been launched.A spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services declined to comment on the case but noted the state agency regularly reviews county children and youth records for compliance with state regulations.The last several state inspections of Luzerne County Children and Youth Services found persistent staffing shortages and numerous other deficiencies, and the county agency's certificate of compliance was changed to provisional status in 2015.
