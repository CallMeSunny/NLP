 The Ardern government may be rethinking New Zealand's involvement in China's One Belt One Road initiative. New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters was unenthusiastic about the infrastructure-building scheme, when asked about it at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. "I do regret the speed with which the previous government signed up," Mr Peters said. "I do not feel we should be bound because the previous government signed up to something." The controversial trillion dollar land and maritime scheme aims to link up Asia, Eurasia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe in a bid to boost trade and economic growth while cutting transit time for goods. The Turnbull government has been reluctant to sign up to the initiative, while Labor appears more open minded. Critics fear China is seeking economic and strategic domination, and human rights and environmental standards could be undermined. There are also concerns poor countries could be left laden with massive debts.
