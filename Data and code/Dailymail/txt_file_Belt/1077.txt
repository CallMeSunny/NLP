DO SEAT BELTS PREVENT LIVER DAMAGE IN CAR CRASHES?Wearing a seat belt reduces people's risk of life-threatening liver damage by more than 20 per cent, research suggested in May 2018.Among people involved in car crashes, seat-belt wearers are 21 per cent less likely to suffer severe liver injuries, which rises to 26 per cent when combined with an airbag, a study found.The liver is one of the most commonly injured organs during motor-vehicle collisions, with severe damage killing around 15 per cent of sufferers, the research adds.Lead author Audrey Renson, from the NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn, said: 'It has been known for some time that seat belt use is associated with lower mortality in a car crash.'Although some may consider this common sense, there is still some controversy lingering around seat belts possibly being harmful and that having an airbag means you donâ€™t have to wear a seat belt.'The researchers believe their findings reinforce the importance of seat belts.Dr Eileen Metzger Bulger, chair of the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma, who was not involved in the study, said the liver and spleen are the most commonly injured organs after motor-vehicle crashes.She added: 'Both can cause severe bleeding, but the spleen can be removed if needed during surgery, which controls the bleeding.'The liver (however) is critical for life and cannot be removed.'
