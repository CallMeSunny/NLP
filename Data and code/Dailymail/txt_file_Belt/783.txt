DAPHNE, 74, TAKES ON 75 TRIATHLONS By Press Association   Published: 14:20 BST, 14 July 2014  |  Updated: 14:20 BST, 14 July 2014                e-mail         A pensioner taking on 75 mini-triathlons will complete the last one on her 75th birthday.Daphne Belt, from Littlehampton in West Sussex, is taking on the challenge to raise money for Chestnut Tree House Children's Hospice.Each day she will complete a 1,000 metre swim at Littlehampton Swimming and Sports centre, before cycling 15km and running 3km along the seafront.Daphne started her challenge on June 1 and will complete her last mini-triathlon on her birthday, August 14. She hopes to raise Â£5,000.Daphne, who first took up triathlons at the age of 50, has competed with the GB squad in countries including Japan, the US and Canada, as well as several competitions in Europe.Her latest fundraising effort will see her take part in the Windsor Triathlon, an Olympic-distance triathlon which challenges participants to complete a 1,500m open water swim followed by a 25-mile bike ride and a 10km run.Daphne said: "As the years roll by, it gets harder and harder to keep pushing myself on. When the going gets hard I tell myself that there are thousands of people who are not able to take part in sports like mine for a variety of reasons and that helps me push through the discomfort zone."I am pleased with the amount raised for Chestnut Tree House so far but I hope to do much better with the fundraising as my mini-triathlon challenge progresses."I am starting to feel a little tired, but I feel confident that I will complete the challenge and raise a significant amount to help the wonderful Chestnut Tree House Children's Hospice."To sponsor Daphne, visit www.justgiving.com/Daphne-Belt.
