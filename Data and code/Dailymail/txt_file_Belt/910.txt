 The production line finishes with a very 'Wallace and Gromit' flourish when a cake resting on a pair of oven gloves is presented to the diner.Decorated with marzipan figurines of Wallace and Gromit, the giant Cake-O-Matic machine may have been inspired by the hit animated TV show but the idea is all Peboryn's.                The giant fruit cake weighs in at 20 stone and contains 100,000 currants         The huge cake machine has had 300 of the mini bakes placed inside it - all of which were made by students at Cornwall College         The edible machine has been named the Cake-O-Matic - exactly what Wallace and Gromit would have called it         The cake is incredibly intricate, and even includes tiny illustrations in the manual that the marzipan Wallace is readingIt took baker Christine Jensen and her team a whopping 400 hours to produce, and the titanic fruit cake is longer than most people are tall at 6.6ft.It weighs in at 20 stone - no doubt due to the 100,000 currants and 200 eggs inside the mammoth fruit cake.But if you're worried about food waste, the mammoth creation is for a very good cause as it's for Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal - a fundraising drive which raises money for Bristol Children's Hospital.'Cake-O-Matic has been the most inspiring cake we've designed to date,' said Christine Jensen, who worked for the NHS as an occupational therapist before turning to cake design.'Not just because we've been able to work with our childhood heroes Wallace and Gromit, and the fantastic support from The Grand Appeal and Aardman studios - that has been amazing - but because we know that so many children will benefit.'          The huge fruit cake pumps out 300 miniature cakes - which will be sold to the public this weekend         Puns are everywhere on the hit clay animation TV show and Peboryon Bakery hasn't left them out of its Wallace and Gromit-inspired creation          A pressure gauge has even been added to the giant edible cake-baking machine, made out of sugar pasteShe added: 'This cake has probably taken around 400 hours - although I think we lost count somewhere in there because this has been in addition to our usual baking, weddings, birthday cakes as well.' The masterpiece has several moving parts - the arm of the mixing bowl rotates, the cake conveyer moves cakes through the cooker and at the end a pair of oven mitts present the finished cake.Activated by a gold chocolate Gromit token, the cake takes spectators on 'a journey' from the mixing bowl, through the oven, with the final baked product delivered on a pair of oven gloves. Inside the huge cake machine are 300 of the mini bakes - all of which were made by students at Cornwall College.The cake is incredibly intricate. No element has been left out - from tiny illustrations in the manual that Wallace is reading, to the pressure gauge on the side of the edible machine.          The machine is activated by gold chocolate Gromit token and will be on show at Cake International in Birmingham this weekend         If it was served up, it would feed about 1,800 people - but the plan is to keep it on show and generate the mini cakes         The mammoth creation is for a very good cause as it's for Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal - a fundraising drive to raise money for a Bristol children's hospitalEach of the tiny rivets - all 1,400 of them - are individually made out of sugar paste. If it was served up, it would feed about 1,800 people - but the plan is to keep it on show and generate the mini cakes. But first it will be displayed at Cake International in Birmingham this weekend - the world's biggest sugar-craft show. Visitors are invited to make a charitable donation in exchange for a golden chocolate Gromit coin to work the machine, which the bakery hope will see Cake-O-Matic raising thousands of pounds for sick children across the three-day exhibition.Several Cornish producers supplied ingredients free of charge for the edible machine when they heard about the charity project.Suzanne Maverick, fundraising manager from The Grand Appeal said, 'Peboryon have created a masterpiece, which captures the essences of the fundraising event.'We're hoping this cracking contraption will inspire bakers to whip out their whisks and hold their own Big Bakes to support sick children and their families across Bristol, the South West and beyond.'We can't thank Peboryon enough for the extraordinary lengths they have gone to in ensuring the cake is an enormous success.'
