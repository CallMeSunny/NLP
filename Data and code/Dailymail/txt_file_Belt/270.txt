THE year of living dangerously starts for Lennox Lewis here in the earthquake belt of southern California tomorrow night.  Not that his plodding Behemoth of a challenger is likely to open a seismic chasm beneath the dancing feet of Britain's world heavyweight champion.  Vitali Klitschko, the 6ft 8in Ukrainian, has a brooding intelligence to go with his university doctorate. But the stiffness of his upright stance and awkward, robotic movement make him look more like the tragic monster in the ring than Dr Frankenstein in the throes of creation.  Lewis does not scare easily, as Mike Tyson discovered to his cost. The threat to him resides not in any opponent. Not in Klitschko or his brother Wladimir. Not even in Roy Jones Jnr, if he can be teased into believing he can give away five stones to the man even Muhammad Ali describes as the world's greatest heavyweight.  The danger lurks in predicting which fight will be the fight too far for Lewis. This is a doubt which nags more heavily at the mind of a 37-yearold athlete once the decision to retire has been taken. And that was done a short while ago at a council- of-war with his devoted mother Violet and master trainer Emanuel Steward.  'One last year,' said Steward. 'That was the agreement. Maybe two more fights, three maximum. He was close to going out at the top after he crushed Tyson a year ago. But he still had the desire, still had the urge to fight, still itched to answer the call of the crowd, still wanted to wipe out any last remaining pockets of opposition.  'I want him to fully satisfy those urges, to get it out of his system, then to retire and never come back. I want him to go out like Marvin Hagler - take his leave as a champion and never look back. Move on in life and never come back.  'So, one last year. But there is a risk. We don't want to get it wrong and lose Lennox his place up there alongside Ali in the history of the ring.  'I'm watching him like a hawk,' added the ringmaster of the Kronk gymnasium of fabled champions. 'I'm looking for any telltale signs, however tiny, that his skills or his strength might be fading.  'But if anything, Lennox is boxing better than at any time in his life. Quite apart from his concussive power he is a consummate technician. His stamina is also the best it has ever been. He is finishing his work stronger than ever before. That is a tribute to his physical conditioning team and to his own application.' So why stop? 'Because there is hardly anyone left for him to beat,' said Steward, 'and because you never know when the decline might set in.' It would be optimistic of Klitschko, even at three inches taller and five years younger, to expect it to happen as early as tomorrow evening in the Staples Centre, the palatial home of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team. Klitschko's promotion from the undercard to mandatory challenger to Lewis for the WBC title comes six months ahead of his planned schedule, courtesy of Kirk Johnson's late withdrawal.  Steward said: 'This has brought fresh momentum to our preparations and not only because Vitali is a dangerous puncher. Unlike Johnson, he won't run away. It will be a better fight - until Lennox knocks him out inside five rounds.' Klitschko has stopped 31 of his 33 opponents but Lewis is scathing. 'Who were the opponents?' asked the champion. 'I don't believe he will risk trying to charge me from the first bell. If he does, he gets it right there and then. If he's cautious, I knock him out the first time I get the opportunity. Either way, expect an early night.' To which Klitschko responded: 'They said Hasim Rahman would go in two rounds but it was Lennox who was knocked out. Now they are giving me five. I take it as a compliment. Thank you very much.' A smooth line but delivered by a man rigid with tension.  Lewis, confident in his vast experience of championship fights in hostile environments, is worryingly serene. He is not even paying lip service to the old ring maxim of never talking about the next big fight before winning the one at hand.  All the discussion here, not least among the television and money men, is whether Jones - the first middleweight to win a heavyweight title for more than a hundred years - can be persuaded to pass up substantial pay-days against Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson and go straight to a $25million (Pounds 15m) jackpot tilt at Lewis. Propagandists for Team Lewis are trying to convince Jones that while the ageing Holyfield would give him the most rugged fight and a spent Tyson might still flatten him, his speed gives him the chance of making history by connecting with the champion's suspect chin.  For the moment it is Klitschko who should beware.  The aggression which habitually erupts in Lewis whenever he is confronted by a heavyweight as big or bigger than himself will be inflamed further by his traditional abstinence from sex for several weeks before a big fight.  So, it was as much to kill time as to enhance his uneven popularity in the U.S. that Lewis threw the ceremonial first pitch for the opening of a series of baseball matches now in progress between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants.  Let the year of living dangerously begin.  j.powell@dailymail.co.uk
