The 51-year-old man from Iowa and his who shot him have been pictured in touching photos and the pair appear to be the best of friends. Richard Remme, of Fort Dodge, was encouraging his dog Balew, a cross between a pit bull and a Labrador, to jump on his lap as he lay on his sofa on Wednesday.That's when the dog apparently flicked the safety catch off the 9mm pistol he was carrying in his belt and shot his owner in the leg.          Richard Remme, 51, says he was shot by his dog Balew while horsing around         The pit bull/Labrador mix apparently flicked the safety catch off of Remme's pistol he was carrying in his belt'I was lying on the couch, and we were horsing around, me and the dog. And I was tossing him off my lap, and he was jumping back on my lap,' Remme told The Messenger newspaper after being discharged from hospital.'Apparently he bumped the safety one time, and when he bounded back over one of his toes went right down into the trigger guard,' the injured dog owner said.'It has a trigger safety as well as a thumb safety, and he managed to hit both of them, and it discharged and went into my leg, did no major damage to anything.'Remme called 911 and told the emergency dispatcher: 'My dog shot me.' 'I've never heard of that,' the city police chief Roger Porter said.'I've heard of guns dropping and going off on the floor, and horsing around and guns going off. I can't say I've heard a dog story before.'

 Cory Husske, his assistant, later issued a statement saying that a police investigation 'could neither prove nor disprove the man's statement of events,' adding that no charges were therefore planned.Police and the UnityPoint Health Trinity Regional Medical Center ambulance were called to the home at about 10.50 am. The dog owner was taken to the hospital and released hours later.'Only in America can you get shot by your dog,' weighed in Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, an organization pushing for stricter gun controls in the United States.The incident proved rather too much for Balew, described by Remme as a 'big wuss' who laid down and cried after the firearm went off.'He thought he was in trouble for doing something wrong,' he said.Remme's daughter has set up a GoFundMe to help with medical expenses.           His gun went off and shot Remme in his leg and he was taken the hospital with minimal injuries
