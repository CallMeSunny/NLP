US drone strike kills at least eight in NW Pakistan By Afp   Published: 16:04 BST, 26 November 2014  |  Updated: 16:04 BST, 26 November 2014                e-mail         A US drone strike killed at least eight suspected militants in Pakistan's restive tribal belt on Wednesday, security officials said.The unmanned aircraft hit a compound in Kund Sar village, 60 kilometres (40 miles) south of Miranshah, the main town in the North Waziristan tribal region which borders Afghanistan."The drone fired two missiles, killing at least eight people and injuring two others," a security official in the area told AFP via phone on condition of anonymity.

It has long been a hub for Al-Qaeda and Taliban militants.The area is generally off-limits to journalists, making it difficult to independently verify the number and identity of the dead.Washington pressed Islamabad for years to wipe out sanctuaries in North Waziristan which militants have used to launch attacks on NATO forces in Afghanistan.The Pakistani military launched a major offensive in the district in June and say they have killed more than 1,500 militants so far, with 125 soldiers losing their lives.
