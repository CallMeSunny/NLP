He has enough hits under his belt to last several lifetimes for the average actor.So it seems only appropriate Denzel Washington is to be honoured with the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the 2016 Golden Globes.The dashing 60-year-old Glory actor star already has two of the prestigious paperweights in his collection, so this will mean he has a hat-trick.         One last Glory day: Denzel Washington is to be given the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the 2016 Golden GlobesIt is handed out by the respected Hollywood Foreign Press Associated for 'outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment.'HPFA President Lorenzo Soria said: 'Washington's long and storied career is earmarked by his countless roles in front and behind the camera.'It is the HFPA's privilege to honor his contributions to the entertainment industry with the Cecil B. DeMille Award.'         Completing the hat-trick: Denzel, here with the Best Actor gong in 2000 for The Hurricane, has two trophiesThe award was first handed out in 1952 at the 9th Annual Golden Globe Awards ceremony and is named in after its recipient The Ten Commandments director Cecil B. DeMille.The Golden Globe was one of the first major awards Denzel won, when he scooped the Best Supporting Actor gong for his turn in 1989 American Civil War epic Glory. He later won the Academy Award in the same category for his performance.He was then lucky enough to win the Best Actor prize for 1999's The Hurricane, the biographical boxing film which was criticized for being extremely economical with the truth.         Spoils of war: Hehe scooped the Best Supporting Actor gong for his turn in 1989 American Civil War epic Glory         Who needs the middleweight belt anyway? He fared better than his subject when he got a Globe for HurricaneIn addition he was nominated a further five times, perhaps most notably losing out for Training Day, his Best Actor Oscar performance. The Cecil B. DeMille Award is handed out annually, with the notable exceptions of 1976 and 2008. Judy Garland was both the first woman to receive the honor at the tender age of 39 in 1962 and she is also the youngest honoree.Samuel Goldwyn, of MGM fame, was the oldest to receive the prize at the age of 90 in 1973.          Shocker: He lost out after being nominated for his turn in Training Day, which won him a Best Actor Oscar
