              View  comments        Patient Brigid O'Callaghan was accidentally strangled when staff at her Bupa care home failed to check on her A 74-year-old woman died at a Bupa care home after being strangled in her wheelchair by a lap belt when she was left alone in her room by staff after a Halloween party.Brigid O'Callaghan, known as Vera, who suffered from confusion and communication difficulties, told staff at the care home she could get herself to bed but 'would have needed significant help', Birmingham Crown Court has heard.The three staff members on night duty at the Amberley Court Nursing Home, Edgbaston, Birmingham, 'were all performing under par' and did not check on her during the night, said prosecutor Bernard Thorogood. Bupa Care Homes Ltd admitted failing to ensure the health and safety of residents at the nursing home. The court heard today that the elderly widow was asphyxiated after slipping from her wheelchair some time after she was taken to her room by care workers on October 27, 2005, and was found dead the next morning.'The prosecution says that, having observed her in a wheelchair, they of course should have appreciated that she needed significant help,' he told the court.The prosecutor said there had been previous incidents at the care home where other residents had fallen from their wheelchairs, which should have 'provided an opportunity for the defendant to think; "Hang about, is there something more we should be doing with relation to this incident?"'The court heard that alerts about the potential hazards of lap-belts had been sent to the home and pinned on a notice board, but no specific training was given to staff about the risks associated with such belts.

 Mr Thorogood said: "Nobody was aware of, or alive to, the risk.'Our case is that the defendant, in some effective way, should have ensured that they were.'He added: 'If standards slip higher up the chain, then they can slip lower down.'Bupa Care Homes Limited pleaded guilty to one count of failing to ensure that residents, including Mrs O' Callaghan, were not exposed to risks to their health and safety, contrary to S3(1)(a) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. The company had admitted a second count of the same crime, relating to other health and safety breaches at the home, at an earlier hearing.Simon Antrobus, mitigating, admitted that on the night of Mrs O'Callaghan's death care staff at the home were responsible for "basic and fundamental failings", but added: 'This company has a good record. This is not an endemic issue with the way Bupa runs its business.'This is a reputable defendant with a responsible attitude towards health and safety.'That reputation would not have been earned ... were it not to provide high standards of care to those who reside in its homes. What happened in this case was out of character.'Judge Robert Juckes QC adjourned sentencing to tomorrow morning.
