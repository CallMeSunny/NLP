Mother of hanged teen is OK with federal investigation By Associated Press   Published: 19:29 BST, 18 June 2016  |  Updated: 19:29 BST, 18 June 2016                e-mail         RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) â€” A civil rights group says the mother of a black teen whose body was found hanging from a swing set by a dog leash and a belt that didn't belong to him is satisfied with the federal investigation that determined the death was a suicide.The North Carolina NAACP released a statement saying that 17-year-old Lennon Lacy's mother also received a promise the case could be re-opened if new evidence was found, noting there is no statute of limitations on a murder charge in the state.Lacy was found hanging in August 2014 in Bladenboro about 100 miles south of Raleigh.A day after federal prosecutors announced their investigation was closed, local prosecutors said Friday they also thought the death was a suicide.
