 The renovation, which will also embellish the gardens beneath the tower, is part of a £350 million project announced last year to modernize the 129-year-old tower that has become the most recognized landmark in Paris.The security renovation should be completed by September.'When you are on site, you see that the 3-meter high walls, compared to the scale of the monument, are absolutely not visible,' said Jose Luis Fuentes, an architect at Dietmar Feichtinger Architects, which is in charge of the project. 'It will really look as if the square (under the Eiffel Tower) was open.'Between 6 and 7 million people visit the Eiffel Tower every year.Concrete bollards were put in place on bridges across London, after jihadists drove a van into pedestrians at London Bridge and Borough Market in June. Last year, council chiefs were urged by Government ministers to do everything they can to protect railway, bus and coach stations against vehicle terror attacks.In a report, the Department of Transport said bollards, benches and walls are 'key front line measures' to protect stations from a potential vehicle borne explosive device or a 'vehicle being used as a weapon to deliberately target pedestrians.'
