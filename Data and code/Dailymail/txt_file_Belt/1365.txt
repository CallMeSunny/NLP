Carl Frampton now has an MBE to go with his IBF world championship belt and is 'very proud' to pin that royal decoration to his chest, albeit preferably when he is not stripped to the waist in a boxing ring.The Jackal, as this Belfast boy styles himself, was awarded his gong for services to community relations in his troubled quarter of Northern Ireland but admits that holding out the hand of friendship will be furthest from his mind this Saturday night.Rather, in the Manchester Arena, he will be trying to land enough punches on the jaw of his arch-rival to add three more initials to his name.

'But I've received the award for community relations, not my boxing, and it won't matter in the ring.'

   Maybe not in his intense prize-fighter's mind, although courage is the common denominator in both his tough walks of life.Frampton hails from the fiercely Protestant Tiger's Bay district of Belfast and it takes a brave son of that community to marry a Catholic girl, as he has done.The worst of The Troubles are in the past but some resentment lingers on and although Frampton tends to downplay his contribution to the peace process he does admit: 'I could have gone the other way, coming from Tiger's Bay.'         Boxer Frampton hails from the fiercely Protestant Tiger's Bay district of Belfast, Northern IrelandThat he chose the path of conciliation rather than the streets scarred by bullets he credits to two people close to his heart, his wife Christine and his mentor Barry McGuigan.He says: 'Me falling in love with a wonderful girl had nothing to do with me being a Protestant and her a Catholic. As nearly all young people know now, what goes on with sectarianism is mostly bulls***.'More importantly, if you treat everyone as you want to be treated yourself the world will be a better place. And most working-class people don't give a fiddler's where you come from.'Frampton was strengthened in those convictions by McGuigan, a Catholic who married a Protestant at the height of The Troubles and became an icon for peace in Ulster as well as a world featherweight champion of all-Irish legend.The pair of them are harnessed together now – as fighter and promoter – along with Barry's son Shane as the trainer. But Frampton recalls being over-whelmed when they first met.         Frampton is fighting for domestic bragging rights, to open his route to bouts of greater magnitude abroadHe says: 'We were introduced at an amateur fight night in Belfast. I was in awe. I was talking to my hero, the great McGuigan. A lot of people came a-knocking around the time I turned pro but there was on only one Barry McGuigan.'He did the early work on me before handing over the regular duties to Shane. From day one he kept drilling it into me that I could be the world champion. Whenever I've wavered in that conviction Barry has made me believe again.'Their relationship is as close to father and son as two genetically unrelated people can be and Frampton says: 'It makes me proud to be considered an extended part of the McGuigan family – and that all of them are part of mine.'They are always so good to me. We're very close-knit and it's a great feeling. It's also a huge help when I'm away in training camp and missing Christine and the kids.'         Frampton has said: 'It makes me proud to be considered an extended part of the McGuigan family'That warmth is fundamental, as well, to their working relationship. Frampton says: 'About 95 per cent of boxers don't trust the team around them. But I have complete trust in the McGuigans, as do my family. That helps me focus completely on the boxing. I have no worries getting into the gym or the ring.'Frampton also thanks McGuigan senior for teeing him up psychologically for what he expects to be a memorable victory over Quigg, in what is the biggest fight thus far in the careers of both. He says: 'I'm more of a natural boxer than Scott but when it's come to making the most of my ability, Barry's made me realise that at times I was keeping something in reserve.'He's encouraged me to let it all go and there'll be no holding back against Scott.'         Sportsmail boxing columnist Jeff Powell (left) smiles alongside Frampton, who now has an MBEMcGuigan says: 'Carl can be a better boxer than me. Perhaps the greatest Irish boxer of all time. He's much calmer than I was in a fight. More controlled, more composed but still highly dangerous and very intelligent.'Frampton is faintly embarrassed by such compliments but says: 'Well, I do think I have a better boxing brain than Scott and that will enable me to adapt to whatever he does in the fight.'He keeps saying how much he's improved in the years we've been building up to this fight – but he hasn't improved as much as me.'The accent is as thick as Irish stew but the Frampton-McGuigan brains trust has the clarity of Waterford crystal.Not that there are any glass jaws involved in this potentially epic unification fight.         Frampton thanks Barry McGuigan senior for teeing him up psychologically for the Scott Quigg bout  Frampton vs Quigg will be televised live from 6pm Saturday night on Sky Sports Box Office.
