French finmin says Portugal does not deserve EU deficit sanction By Reuters   Published: 08:37 BST, 11 July 2016  |  Updated: 08:37 BST, 11 July 2016                e-mail         PARIS, July 11 (Reuters) - Portugal has made huge belt-tightening effort and does not deserve EU sanctions on its public finances, French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said on Monday."The (European) Commission is entitled" to launch a disciplinary procedure. But "Portugal doesn't deserve to have exaggerated discipline imposed," Sapin told a news conference.The European Commission began formal disciplinary procedures against Spain and Portugal on Thursday for their excessive deficits in 2014 and 2015. The procedures may lead to fines for the two countries before the end of July.Such sanctions have never yet been applied, and it remains unclear whether they will be imposed this time. The Council of EU finance ministers will decide on the Commission's recommendation at their regular meeting on July 12.(Reporting by Michel Rose; Writing by Ingrid Melander; Editing by Andrew Callus)
