Conor McGregor has revealed a shot at the welterweight title has leapt to the top of his wish list.The Irishman, who holds the featherweight belt, was due to face lightweight champion Rafael dos Anjos at UFC 196 this weekend before the Brazilian pulled out with a broken foot.Instead he will take on Nate Diaz in a hastily arranged fight at 170lb and, should he win, McGregor could then target the belt Robbie Lawler has held since 2014.          UFC featherweight champion Conor McGregor has held an open training session for fans and media          McGregor acknowledges his crowd by spreading his arms wide open prior to the practice session         Irishman McGregor looks on, wearing white boxing gloves and green shorts on Wednesday night'Yeah, that's there,' he said. 'Why not? That's probably the leading option. I mean Dos Anjos is an absolute bum. How can you pull out of a fight with a bruised foot? And he's still complaining; man up and fight. 'I like Robbie, I won't say a bad word about Robbie. He fights with his heart, he's been around the game so, so long. But if we fought, I'd beat him. I'm too fast for him. The size difference is not anything. I've stood beside him, I've seen him [up close].'But I do like Robbie. I respect him as a champion, as a man who drifted off, came back and rose up. He stood up and is welterweight champion. We'll see how it goes; that is an appealing one.'

 With the withdrawal of Dos Anjos, McGregor's bid to become the first fighter in the UFC to hold two belts consecutively has been put on hold. But the 27-year-old dismissed the idea that his allure has been diminished by the late change of opponent while insisting that he could still make the 145lb featherweight limit.'This is always history, every damn time,' he said. 'The gates keep rising, the pay-per-view keeps rising, the attendance; everything keeps rising. It's always history when I step inside that Octagon. I've two belts at home - I've the interim and the unified featherweight and I've the featherweight and lightweight world titles I won in the previous organisation. There's belts everywhere with me.          McGregor takes a selfie with supporters at the Jabbawockeez Theater in the MGM Grand Hotel/Casino'I'm seriously considering making my own damn belt and then I'll decide what weight the flight is at. Why not? Who cares about the belts. [I'm] the money fight. This is the fight everyone wants. They should be chasing me for it, knocking everyone out of their way to get to it, not crying and complaining and saying, "I'm going to wait". 'The thing about making that cut to 145lb, people only see the build-up and the fight. People don't see after the fight, it's a process, a strain to get your body back after a cut like that. This time, I'm waking up at 168lb, I'm waking up under weight. So after the fight I won't have that process to get myself back right again. I'll be just me, normally.'I can go back to 145lb no problem; who is there though? Let me see some of these damn bums get up and make some noise. I just hear crying and complaining, begging, all this s***. I need to see something, they need to build themselves up. I'm sitting pretty up here. They need to fight and make some noise, make me stand up and say, "okay, I'll take him in".          Dubliner McGregor looks focused ahead of his fight against Nate Diaz in UFC 196 on Saturday night'Right now I see a bunch of whiners: "oh, I'm sitting it out, I'm going to wait". When have I ever waited? Never once. The title shot is gone, did I wait? No, I took this fight. [No] title shot after Poirier. Did I wait? No, I took the Siver fight. That's what champions do. That's what generates interest. I'm a hungry mother***** that does not care who is in his way.' And McGregor does not expect Diaz to be in his way for long here in Las Vegas on Saturday night.'If you've been following me or him you'll know that there's been subtle digs over the course of the past year or two years where he's said this and said that,' he said. 'Now all of a sudden he's a scared little brother of some sort.'How many times has he had this swagger about him [in the past]. Last week he sat there and he done nothing. He shouldn't have said anything [because] as soon as he said something, I picked his bones off him.'He's trying to say people are afraid to fight him. I hunted him down, stalked him, and now I have him trapped on Saturday.                McGregor, who is a heavy favourite to win the fight with Diaz at odds of 4/1, practices his hammer fist         Fighter McGregor (right) prepares for his latest bout with a trainer in Las Vegas, Nevada         The flexible 27-year-old mixed martial artist gets into a fighting position as he puts on a show for fans         McGregor flares a kick at his padded-out trainer at the event prior to his clash with 30-year-old Diaz'I'd love to see it play out a little longer, so I can show the fans the improvement I didn't get to show in that last fight because it was over so quickly. But I just can't see him taking the shots. He's going to feel a new level of precision, a new level of power and a new level of unorthodox fighting that he's never experienced before. I hope he'll last until the end of the first but I don't see it.'Diaz, meanwhile, claimed he is finally getting the recognition he has long sought from the UFC and that he talked the talk long before McGregor.                Diaz also took part in an open training session in Las Vegas ahead of his fight with McGregor at UFC 196'I've been saying that for years but they tried to shut me down,' he said. 'They kind of put me in the shadows and said keep that big money s*** on the low. 'When he says it, it's this new thing [but] I was talking that before he was even in the UFC. It's in every article and every headline because he’s from Ireland. I’m a big fan of what he does, he puts it out there, the real s***, just like I did.'They didn’t want my stock getting any higher especially when I started pitching about a bigger pay day because I’ve put in a lot in. 'I’ve been in this career a good little minute. I was like 'hold on I'm putting a lot in and when's it going to pay back'. 'Unfortunately it was on a week’s notice but finally I'm getting something back. I knew this was going to happen sooner or later.'         Diaz says that he was talking the big-money talk long before McGregor came on to the scene
