   Later Alvarez added: 'I promise you I would beat Billy Joe Saunders with one hand tied behind my back and my eyes closed.' Saunders turned on Golovkin , holder of all the other middleweight alpha-belts, saying: 'Why did you pullout of fighting me twice this summer.?'            Golovkin said he wanted to fight Saunders as a warm-up for 'the real drama' fight with CaneloGolovkin smiled and said: 'I wanted you as an opponent for a June or July fight in my country (Kazakhstan) to help me focus on the real drama fight with Canelo.'Both times your team told me you had no chance of you being fit and ready. You talk too much instead of fighting.' Saunders is hoping to clinch a fight against the winner but Golovkin added: 'I've wasted too much of my time on you already' In any event, Golovkin and Canelo are talking rematch or even trilogy if the night of September 16 in Las Vegas lives up to Golden Boy Promoter Oscar De La Hoya's expectations as 'one of the great middleweight title fights of all time'.He and both boxers are confident that if it comes to a financial pay-per-view the public will watch this event rather than Floyd Mayweather's 'showbiz' comeback against UFC star Conor McGregor three weeks earlier on the Vegas Strip.          Promoter Oscar De La Hoya talked down Floyd Mayweather's fight with Conor McGregorGolovkin says: 'The public understands the difference between a true fight and a money show. To everyone who wants to see a great fight, I say watch our fight.' Canelo : 'Ours is the huge fight all the fans have been demanding. No question. Mayweather? No comment.' De La Hoya added: 'Mayweather vs McGregor? Well, Mayweather-Pacquiao was a let down.'Canelo v Golovkin - between two elite warriors - is the only fight 100 per cent guaranteed to deliver a tremendous fight.' Golovkin and Canelo battle for WBC, WBA, IBF and IBO middleweight supremacy on September 16. It will be televised live late that night as the first pay-per-view event on the dedicated BoxNation channel.Saunders is expected to make a curtain raising appearance earlier that evening on a regular BoxNation broadcast in a London defence of his title.
