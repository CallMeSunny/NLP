Iraq forces foil attack by would-be teenage bomber By Afp   Published: 14:59 BST, 22 August 2016  |  Updated: 15:00 BST, 22 August 2016                e-mail         Iraqi security forces apprehended a teenager wearing a suicide belt before he was able to detonate it in the city of Kirkuk, security officials said on Monday.The foiled attack late Sunday was one of a series of security incidents in Kirkuk and came a day after a child suicide bomber killed more than 50 people in Turkey."Police forces managed to stop a bomber who was wearing a suicide belt. He was born in 2001," Kirkuk police chief Brigadier General Khattab Omar Aref told reporters.
