Waymo, Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit, would start testing its self-driving vehicles in Atlanta, it said on Twitter on Monday.'Atlanta is a major hub for technology and innovation, and a natural fit for Waymo's testing program,' Waymo said on Twitter. With over eight years of testing under its belt, Waymo is a pioneer of self-driving technology, and is already testing vehicles in suburban Phoenix, Michigan, Silicon Valley and San Francisco.Scroll down for video          Waymo, Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit, would start testing its self-driving vehicles in Atlanta, it said on Twitter on Monday. The latest step marks the 25th city Waymo has tested in, according to the firmWhile self-driving car companies test their vehicles in public, they routinely have a human in the driver's seat ready to take over if the technology fails.Waymo announced the plans on Twitter today, revealing the move follows the success of its recent trials in Arizona - where there are no restrictions on self-driving cars.The firm launched their Phoenix program back in November 2017. 'Hello ATL! Metro Atlanta is the next stop for Waymo's test program,' the firm wrote on Twitter.'Now that we have the world's first fully self-driving vehicles on public roads in AZ, we're looking to take our tech to more cities.'    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       The universe may be filled with ALIEN VIRUSES - and they...

 The latest step marks the 25th city Waymo has tested in, according to the firm. 'With Atlanta, Waymo has now officially tested in 25 cities across the US,' the firm said on Twitter.'That includes complex places such as the foggy hills of SF, the snowy streets of Michigan, and the rainy roads of Kirkland, WA.'         With eight years of testing under its belt, Waymo is a pioneer of self-driving technology, and is already testing vehicles in suburban Phoenix, Michigan, Silicon Valley and San Francisco. Pictured, John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, debuts a customized Chrysler Pacifica HybridThis past fall, Waymo launching a ride-hailing service for the general public in Phoenix, Arizona with no human driver behind the steering wheel.Leading up to the decision, the firm tested such fully self-driving cars on public roads in Arizona, Chief Executive John Krafcik said.The announcement by Krafcik at the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon marked a major advance in the roll-out of fully autonomous vehicles.HOW DOES WAYMO TEST ITS SELF-DRIVING CARS BEFORE PUTTING THEM ON PUBLIC ROADS?Waymo built 'Castle,' a hidden mock city that can quickly be configured to test different scenarios.It's located north of the Merced metro area where the Castle Air Force Base used to be an has been rented by Google since 2014.As part of the initial two-year lease, the firm rented 80 acres from Merced Country for $456,000, being paid in $19,000 monthly installments.It has different driving environments including residential streets, expressway-style streets, cul-de-sacs, and parking lots.         The Waymo test site is located north of the Merced metro area, where the Castle Air Force Base used to beAt Castle, the roads are named after famous cars, such as DeLorean, Bullitt, Thunderbird, Fury, and Barbaro.For the structured testing, Waymo looks at how self-driving cars perform on real roads to determine how they need to practice - then they build what's required at Castle.The fake city has no buildings except one - a converted military dorm Waymo employees sleep in when they're too tired to make it back to San Francisco.It's hidden, and you need GPS coordinates to find it.          Castle is located north of the Merced metro area where the Castle Air Force Base used to be, 2.5 hours from the company's headquarters. There, Waymo is testing several types of self-driving cars, including Chysler Pacificas minivansWhile self-driving car companies test their vehicles in public, they routinely have a human in the driver's seat ready to take over if the technology fails.Large tech companies, established automakers and well-funded startups are all vying for what they expect to be a new era for vehicles and a lucrative opportunity.At the time, Waymo said that members of the public would begin riding in its fleet of Fiat Chrysler Pacifica minivans outfitted with Waymo technology - and without human drivers - in the next few months.At first, the passengers will be accompanied in the back seat by a Waymo employee, but eventually the passengers will travel alone in the robotic car.
