  2. Stay away from ripped garmentsBelieve it or not, denim distressing is an art that takes times time and skill. While jeans with holes almost always look cool, a style from your favorite budget retailer will most likely appear worn out. Distressing techniques are often less convincing at lower price points. So if you're not shopping premium denim, stick to clean, rip-free styles.               Super Skinny Regular Jeans by H&M3.  Replace buttons An inexpensive garment will come with cheap plastic buttons. To make your jacket, blouse or blazer look more upscale, replace the chintzy closures with more ornate versions.The simple swap can also breathe new life into a tired wardrobe go-to that you love too much to get rid of.Quality buttons can be found at your local 'trimmings' shop, Goodwill, amazon or even eBay.          10 piece Assorted Gold Rhinestone Buttons, $25.99; amazon.com4. Opt for a classic black shoeWhile feather details, embellishment and platforms are all en vogue, resist the urge to buy a statement shoe unless you have the $$$ to drop on a designer pair. Choose a clean, classic shape in black (black looks richer than brown and other earth tones like moss green and mauve) in your correct size. Less is more when it comes to an inexpensive shoe,  so avoid unnecessary hardware. You can never go wrong with a sleek pair of patent leather pumps.          MILIA-159X Pump by Cupid, $43; amazon.com5. Create a smooth silhouette Just because you're shopping on a budget, doesn't mean you have to look like you are. Cheap clothes tend to be ill-fitting because they are constructed out of flimsy material. To make your wardrobe look instantly more luxe, you must create a solid foundation. Lightweight, seamless shape wear can minimize unwanted bumps and distractions.              Nude Molded Firm Control Body Shaper by , $24.28; dhgate.com
