He's Dangerous! Blue-belt Blanket Jackson hones his karate skills as he hits a class flanked by security By Daily Mail Reporter   Published: 12:05 BST, 13 November 2013  |  Updated: 12:44 BST, 13 November 2013    


         e-mail          70 View  comments    He has had somewhat of an unconventional childhood to date due to his father being the late Michael Jackson. But on Tuesday Blanket showed he was just like any other 11-year-old boy as he hit his weekly karate class.Wearing his impressive blue belt, Michael’s youngest child was flanked by his security team, although judging by the amount of classes he’s putting in it won’t be long until he can protect himself.       The karate kid: Blanket Jackson headed to a martial arts class with his security team on Tuesday in Los Angeles  Clutching a bottle of water the raven haired young boy was clearly taking his training seriously.  


         e-mail          70 View  comments    While Blanket is often accompanied by his 16-year-old brother Prince, who practises jiu jitsu, on this occasion it was a solo expedition. Prince is known to attend the renowned Gracie Academy in Beverly Hills -- where there are only five belts to be earned in their colour hierarchy, and there's no fast-tracking to move up ranks.                Impressive: Blanket has managed to earn himself a blue belt in karate after attending classes regularly   And so far Prince has done extremely well – he’s gained a blue belt after her learnt another 34 different manoeuvres each with approximately four alternative techniques.In terms of self defense jiu jitsu and karate are not so different, as they both derive from the same eastern country, are empty handed and focus on technique and power with similar moves.In recent months Prince has taken his little brother under his wing, while their sister Paris, 15, is getting treatment in a facility in Utah after attempting to take her own life back in the summer.       Keeping hydrated: Blanket sensibly carried a bottle of water with him as he headed to his class  While all three Jackson children are still under the care of Michael's mother Katherine Jackson, who they live with in the LA suburb of Calabasas, Prince clearly takes his big brother duties very seriously.It has been sometime since an update has been released on their sister’s well-being, however back in August Katherine opened up about Paris.She said: 'She is in a good place, getting the help she needs. She's doing much better. The treatment is going good, really good. She's my baby. It's hard for me, really hard. All I wanted these kids to be is happy.'Meanwhile according to reports Katherine is not keen for Dr Conrad Murray to regain his medical license, following his stint in jail for involuntary manslaughter of her son Michael.According to the New York Daily News sources close to Murray are calling her a hypocrite because just 12 months earlier she was said ‘she believed he was not a threat to others and deserved to be out of out of prison on bail during his appeal.’      The team: If Blanket keeps up his classes it won't be long until he can ditch his security team
