MyZone MZ-3                                                                        myzone.org, £129.99 Rating: I always love it when fitness gadgets tell me that I have a heart rate of 147, a blood oxygen level of 97 per cent and a ‘split’ time of 0.37. Frankly, this might as well be in Old Norse runes for all the sense I can make of it – so I mentally translate it to ‘A+, well done, sit at the front of the class’. I understand just about enough of the data from the various fitness bracelets I’ve tested to know that my resting heart rate means that a) I am alive, and b) I’m likely to remain so until Christmas.          You log in with your height and weight, strap the thing on to your chest and wait for a beep. The MyZone MZ-3 does the rest, transmitting data to a phone app. This also, sadly, means there’s no cheatingWell, that’s enough, isn’t it? Hence my occasional jogs have remained at the same, listless pace for decades – and I’m still overtaken by people 20 years my senior and young parents with those irritating jogging prams. But a new fitness chest strap promises to make sense of the whole affair, and possibly accelerate me above 2mph for the first time in my life. The MyZone belt is a big idea and already used widely in gyms in America. It offers readings that remove the endless gibberish about heart rates and lap times and replaces them with a clear readout showing how much effort you’re making, based on a percentage of your own maximum heart rate. Sadly for slackers such as myself, strapping on the MyZone is a rather different affair from counting daily steps on my phone’s pedometer and assuming that getting to 10,000 somehow entitles you to a doughnut.          The MyZone band is merciless, updating its numbers based on your current maximum heart rate, so that as your own fitness improves, the amount of effort you have to put in goes upYou log in with your height and weight, strap the thing on to your chest and wait for a beep. The gadget does the rest, transmitting data to a phone app. This also, sadly, means there’s no cheating. When you’re exercising, you’re awarded four MyZone Effort Points a minute for staying in the highest red and yellow effort zones, but a mere one point a minute for staying in the grey zone. Seems I have spent my life in the grey zone. The MyZone band is merciless, updating its numbers based on your current maximum heart rate, so that as your own fitness improves, the amount of effort you have to put in goes up. Even over a couple of weeks, it’s noticeable. What’s good is that both a pro and a slacker like me can enjoy the same ‘green’ rating – despite the fact that if I did the pro’s workout would probably kill me. In a world infested with gadgets for the hardcore Lycra brigade, this can only be a good thing.
