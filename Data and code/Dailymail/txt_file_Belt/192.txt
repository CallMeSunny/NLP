The company behind a corset-like belt that claims to make women 'look thinner in seconds' is facing backlash from social media users who have labeled the item as 'sexist', 'painful-looking', and 'terrifying'.Called Miss Belt, the contraption cinches around waists to flatten and suck in stomachs at the middle, resulting in an exaggerated hourglass shape for the wearer.However, many women - and some men - have a problem with the product's claim that it gives ladies 'the perfect waistline', arguing on Twitter that the belt's results look unnatural and ignore the progress that women have made from oppression over the past couple centuries.Scroll down for video         Belt ban: Many Twitter users are complaining about a commercial for a corset belt called Miss Belt         Getting skinny: The belt claims to slim a woman's waist in seconds and give her an hourglass figure         For new moms: The makers advice women to use it for everyday purposes and to hide a baby body              Wear at the beach? The commercial notes that the Miss Belt can be worn at any time - even while lounging by the poolUsing compression technology, Miss Belt purports to be able to make women look two sizes smaller by tucking in bellies, reducing waistlines, and providing back support.The brand's website says the $19.99 product can be used at work, while exercising, and even while relaxing - the time that most women prefer to unwind and take off constricting undergarments.Their commercial also claims that supermodels and celebrities use Miss Belt, and quotes several apparently happy customers. 'No one will know you're wearing it - but he will notice,' teases the voiceover, also adding that the belt is a great tool for hiding a 'baby body'.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Comedian teaches men 'almost acceptable' cat calls to yell...
