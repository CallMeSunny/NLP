Josh, who is half-Italian, said he loved to eat big portions of food - but after joining a slimming club he cut out oil and fat and started playing football'So I had to ask to swap seats with my aunt because she had an extended seat belt. My mum saw the man next to me pull a face in disgust so she started crying.'She only told me three weeks ago. I didn't notice at the time because I was so embarrassed I just looked straight on.'Josh vowed to start losing weight after Christmas, but then an incident while he was playing football with a friend prompted him to act quicker. He said: 'One day I got bitten by an insect. I thought nothing of it but my leg started to swell up, so I took some antibiotics.'I was told it was called cellulitis and it was caused when the antibiotics can't get into the system - and it can cause diabetes. 'When I heard that my jaw dropped and my face went pale. That was the moment I decided to change.'Josh then joined Slimming World in his hometown, along with his parents.He said: 'My dad also had a lot of health problems so me and my parents all joined together.               John, pictured before he joined Slimming World, had another scare when he suffered a swollen leg and cellulitis.

Now they've lost some weight too, but not as much as I have.'Josh has lived with his girlfriend Chloe Yallop, 20, for more than a year, and said she has been a great support.He said: 'My partner Chloe has been great. She's done a hell of a lot for me. She doesn't come to the classes but she eats the same food as me because she's trying to keep healthy. 'She's nothing like the size I was. She's beautiful in every way already.'I'm half-Italian and of course Italians like to eat a lot of food. I used to eat quite big portions. Now I've realised you can have a big portion, but a healthy portion.'It took me 32 weeks to achieve my new weight of 18 stone. I'm happy with the way that I look now. I'm quite tall and broad so now I'm just trying to get toned up.'I never touch oil these days and I don't have any fatty foods at all. I don't eat out in restaurants either. It's saved me a hell of a lot of money - I've even got a new car! It's brought a lot of bonuses.
