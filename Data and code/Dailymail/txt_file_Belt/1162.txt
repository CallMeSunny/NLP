 ‘It was never my plan to shoplift – I know it’s silly. I’ve always wanted to be a hairdresser so that’s what I’m going to do next.’During a rebuke of the two young women, magistrate Suzanne O'Connell told them off for grinning in the dock as they admitted charges of theft.And she warned them: 'Do you understand the fact that you two young ladies who could do very well for yourselves but went out to a shop and stole and got a criminal record that will affect the rest of your life?'She asked Akhtar - who had two previous shoplifting convictions: 'What is your excuse? When was the last time you worked? Why haven't you worked since? You may have heard that prison is easy but trust me it is not.         Akhtar (left) and 18-year old Anashra Ali were caught stealing designer clothes worth £380 and £386 of cosmetics from the shelves of Harvey Nichols in Manchester on December 12, last month'That is your choice, you can get a grip on your life and work with probation but if you don't then the likelihood is that you will go to custody.' Miss O'Connell also asked Ali - who has a caution for shoplifting and lives off her mother: 'What possible explanations do you have?'Why did you steal? You've got no job you go to Harvey Nichols to steal, do you think that is acceptable? Do you know the effect it has on the stores and everybody in this court room?'You shoplifting and taking things comes at a loss to the company and they will have to raise prices to recover that money.         The pair, from Cheetham Hill, Manchester, were caught by a security guard who saw them 'shielding each other from members of the public' as they put goods in a bag'Everybody who goes to Harvey Nichols will have to pay more money in that shop. That may even effect members of your own family.'The situation at the moment is that if you carry on like this then you will find yourself in prison. This a serious matter. There is little mitigation on your behalf. 'The pair, from Cheetham Hill, Manchester, embarked on their shoplifting expedition last month on December 12 after the store which is a favourite of Premier League footballers and TV soap stars opened late for Christmas shoppers.Prosecuting Miss Risha Seth told Manchester magistrates court: 'The on duty security officer Will Foster describes witnessing two females acting suspiciously on the cosmetics floor at 8.34pm. Both of them seemed to be shielding each other from members of the public and selecting items from the back of the shelves which he described as unusual.         Above, the Harvey Nichols store in Manchester where Nafisa Akhtar and Anashra Ali were caught stealing cosmetics and designer clothing'He continued to watch both of the females. One of them put cosmetic products in a bag that she was carrying. That female was identified as Nafisa Akhtar. She put the items in her bag and he was of the opinion that she had no intent on paying for these items.'The other female was Anashra Ali. He watched both of the girls make their way around the store on the CCTV systems, picking up items.'The girls made their way towards the exits not going near the tills with no intention of paying for any of the items.'They attempted to exit but were approached by the security guard and asked to go back inside where the items were recovered. They were able to be resold and there was no loss to the company.'Ali, from Cheetham Hill, Manchester, has a previous caution for shoplifting in March 2017, and Akhtar from nearby Harpurhey has two previous convictions for shoplifting in October and December of 2017.Akhtar previously stole £1,000 worth of Apple products from a store in Sheffield and was handed a 12 month conditional discharge.In mitigation for the two girls, defence lawyer Mr Nnamdi Inegbo said: 'Ultimately I think both these parties, they are genuinely good friends.         Ali, from Cheetham Hill, Manchester, had a previous caution for shoplifting in March of 2016, and Akhtar from nearby Harpurhey has two previous convictions for shoplifting in October and December of 2016'The CCTV is quite damning which is all I can really say. Miss Akhtar relocated to Sheffield which is where one of the other offences took place, but she has had to move back to Manchester.'There seems to be a more settled family life for her now. She accepts what she has done and that she needs to work with probation.'Miss Ali has no previous convictions and admits that she was there. The amount is high. 'All I can say is that the items were recovered. The CCTV speaks volumes and they have accepted their parts in the joint enterprise.'Akhtar was ordered to complete a 12 month community order and 150 hours unpaid work whilst Ali - who claimed she carried out the offence due to 'peer pressure' - was conditionally discharged for 12 months.Both were each ordered to pay £105 in court costs and surcharges.
