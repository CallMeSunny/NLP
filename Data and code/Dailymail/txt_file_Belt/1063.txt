Economic recovery 'will be slower than forecast' CBI warns   Updated: 13:12 BST, 22 September 2010                     9 View  comments   Government belt tightening will mean the pace of economic recovery in the UK will be slower next year than previously forecast, the CBI has warned.The business group downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for 2011 to 2.0 per cent, from 2.5 per cent in its last forecast in June.It said the revision took into account a weaker outlook for consumer spending next year as households will have less disposable income due to ongoing high inflation, resulting from January's VAT rise, and modest wage increases.

But the group's latest forecast was not all doom and gloom, with growth forecasts for this year revised upwards to 1.6 per cent in 2010, from 1.3 per cent in June. The slight upward revision reflects better than expected growth in the second quarter of this year as companies began rebuilding their stocks, the CBI said. It also believes the UK is likely to avoid slipping into a double dip recession. Richard Lambert, CBI director-general, said: 'The degree of uncertainty around the outlook remains high, but our view is that the UK's tentative recovery will be sustained, albeit with weaker levels of growth. 'The fragile nature of the recovery is why, in the forthcoming spending review, the Government must focus its scarce resources on those areas which most galvanise growth, namely infrastructure and capital investment.' The CBI has forecast consumer spending growth of 0.9 per cent in 2010, followed by one per cent in 2011. With VAT increasing to 20 per cent from January, inflation is expected to remain above the Bank of England's two per cent target through to the end of next year. But the CBI said the Bank was likely to start increasing interest rates later than previously expected, forecasting a rise to 1.25 per cent by the end of 2011. UK exports are expected to grow by 3.5 per cent in 2010 and 6.4 per cent in 2011, with net trade predicted to make a positive contribution to GDP growth rates throughout the forecast period, the CBI added.  Unemployment will rise from an expected 2.49m at the end of this year to 2.62m at the end of 2011 and public sector net borrowing is forecast to reach £141bn in 2010/11, before falling to £116bn in 2011/12, according to its report.
