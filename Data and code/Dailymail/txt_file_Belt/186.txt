A report in yesterday’s paper said that the number of homes built on Green Belt land had risen by a quarter to 275,000 last year. In fact this was the number of homes proposed for Green Belt land rather than the number of homes already built.   If you wish to report an inaccuracy, please email corrections@dailymail.co.uk. To make a formal complaint under IPSO rules please go to www.dailymail.co.uk/readerseditor where you will find an easy-to-use complaints form.You can also write to Readers’ Editor, Daily Mail, Northcliffe House, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT or contact IPSO directly at ipso.co.uk
