SHOW me a man who does not have the occasional bet and I'll wager he wears both braces and a belt, carries his loose change in a zip-up purse and washes his own socks in hotel bathrooms.  No crime in that, of course, but he's missing out on a lot of fun. Punting, the eternal optimism of getting plenty for a minimal investment, can also be pernicious if the old lady is buying lottery tickets instead of bread, but it's been with us since Diomed won The Derby at 6-4 in 1780.  In football, it's been going on since March 16, 1872, the date of the first FA Cup Final at Kennington Oval when the Royal Engineers, odds-on 4-7 favourites, were beaten 1-0 by Wanderers.  That's the story of my betting life. In November 1996, I flew into Las Vegas to discover that Evander Holyfield was being offered at 22-1 to beat Mike Tyson in their first fight.  Unimaginable odds in a two-horse race yet I did not have a single dollar on it. Holyfield won convincingly.  Inside information is the name of the game and that has been offered to me only once.  In the Sixties - I shall conceal the actual date to protect those still living - I received a phone call from a friend travelling with the Australian cricket team then playing in Nottingham. He implored me to back a certain horse running nearby that day. I checked with the Daily Mail's racing expert of the day. 'Three legs,' he said. 'No form, no chance.' It won at a very high price. The race was fixed. Several Australian cricketers were considerably enriched and so, for a day or two, was I.  But where, in other circumstances, does this inside information come from?  For example, what caused the phone lines to Britain's bookmakers to grow hot on Thursday morning following England's 2-0 defeat by France at Wembley?  The unreasonable expectation that Howard Wilkinson, the caretaker coach, could transform a bunch of stiffs into a team to beat the world champions inside a week had weakened him in the betting to become Glenn Hoddle's permanent successor, an assessment endorsed only by Mr Wilkinson's almost incoherent analysis of the match on BBC radio next morning.  Clearly he would have loved the floodlighting cables to have been sabotaged at halftime, but no such luck.  Anyway, Kevin Keegan's name was now dominating the frame, despite the fact he had already pledged himself to continue the miracle he is working with Harrods FC at Fulham.  Graham Sharpe, the appropriately named odds-maker for William Hill, had priced Keegan at 10-1 for the England job long before Hoddle shared his oriental religious convictions about reincarnation with a Times reporter.  On the eve of the Wembley match, with Hoddle now fired, the odds against Keegan taking over had come down to 6-1. When betting opened on Thursday morning, Sharpe had cut them to 5-1. Midmorning, he had lowered them to 3-1. Suddenly, even at that price, switchboards lit up and money was being deluged over counters to back Keegan as the next boss of England. At 2pm, Sharpe closed the William Hill book. Keegan, by then, was 4-6 favourite.  Within 30 minutes Keegan reiterated to a Press conference that he would stay at Fulham for the remaining 18 months of his contract. 'I am,' he said, 'a man of my word.' I don't doubt him. Only a moron would want to become coach of an England team still struggling to qualify for the finals of the European Championship.  Who promulgates this information? I am not sure. But cascades of money will change hands.  Remember, the bet is on who is appointed the new permanent England coach. Having missed out on Holyfield to beat Tyson, I might go out and have a few quid on Keegan this morning.  It is an impossible job, of course, but if the Football Association accede to media pressure to announce a permanent appointment within the next few days, they will be even more ridiculous than they have appeared in recent months.  Did one of their number leak the information which caused such a huge fluctuation in the betting market?  Take no advice from a column so fiscally stupid that it joined Lloyd's in the mid-Eighties. But discard the braces, unzip the purse and have a flutter on Kevin Keegan.  Something tells me that, eventually, he will be the man.  THIS SLEDGING war in cricket has reached a new dimension. Now you deliver a mouthful of abuse and obscenity to an opponent and then turn smiling towards the TV cameras as though you have been exchanging compliments.  Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne, Australia's near-omnipotent bowlers, have perfected the art of this deception and England's batsmen are falling for it, drawn into verbal retaliation or, more seriously, attempting to play retributive shots which frequently prove fatal.  Sledging on this scale was encouraged by the former Australian captain, Ian Chappell, who is a close friend. I despise him for it. He tells me, in abusive terms, where to get off.  It is that sort of relationship, but he is wrong.  Obscenities fly around all the time. And who's to blame? Well, obviously the players who indulge in it are to blame, but so are the umpires who do nothing to stop it.  Several international umpires are now basking in television fame hoping, perhaps, to emulate the now retired Dickie Bird in writing a massively profitable best-selling book.  Book-writing is not their task.  Keeping control of international cricket matches is. A few sendings-off would not go amiss.  It would soon put a stop to this cancer in the game but, until empowered to exercise their authority, the umpires will continue to allow this obnoxious exchange of vile obscenity to go on.
