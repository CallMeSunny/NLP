DAILY MAIL COMMENT: Stop the party games and speak for Britain   By Daily Mail Comment   Published: 00:50 BST, 31 October 2012  |  Updated: 00:50 BST, 31 October 2012                     38 View  comments   Ask voters of any political persuasion whether the EU’s bloated budget should go up or down, and 99 times out of 100 you’ll get the same answer.When national governments all over Europe are cutting their spending – and family incomes are squeezed to the bone – Brussels must tighten its belt, too.Indeed, millions think it monstrous that the European Commission has the arrogance to demand an inflation-busting 5 per cent increase in contributions to its wasteful, growth-stifling bureaucracy.      99 out of 100: It is not hard to gauge the voter's feelings on whether the EU budget should continue to rise or be cut back Over the past few days, Labour MPs have made a political guessing game of the issue, hinting they may support Tory rebels in demanding budget cuts, rather than the real-terms freeze for which David Cameron has argued.Indeed, so glaring is the opportunistic hypocrisy of a party that sold Britain down the river to Brussels that some Tories are said to have been put off rebelling by the thought of voting the same way as Ed Balls.Tonight, when the Commons debates Britain’s negotiating stance over the budget, the games must stop.MPs must speak for their constituents. That means giving Mr Cameron the strongest mandate to face down the commission – and veto any deal that is bad for Britain (and Europe). Victory for sanityWith the prospect of a moratorium on building onshore wind farms, this paper is hugely relieved that one of the most fatuous and expensive political vanity projects of our time is to be halted.We take with a pinch of salt John Hayes’s claim that he is winding the policy down because enough turbines have already been approved to meet ‘green’ targets.      Do we really have enough wind turbines in planning to meet our energy targets or is there another reason for this announcement?         More from Daily Mail Comment...     DAILY MAIL COMMENT: 1,000 days of incompetence, betrayal and now national humiliation... how DID victory turn to this? 19/03/19     If MPs back May's Brexit deal, we can leave the EU, unite the country and end the political paralysis holding Britain back.
