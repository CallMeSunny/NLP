When I first spotted the trend for statement belts coming over the horizon, I’ll admit I was nervous. For while belts may be back in business, my waistline isn’t.At 48, and after having two small giants — OK, quite some time ago (the eldest is ten, the ‘baby’ is eight) — my waist has settled into what can only be described as middle-aged spread. Isn’t nature maddening, with its yearly incremental gathering of flab that no amount of yoga, Pilates or frantic early morning jogs around the park can dent?Now, belts are back. Hmmm.You probably think you’re sorted in the belt department. One black, one tan and maybe a leopard-print one for when you’re feeling really brave.         Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is among the celebrities sporting Gucci's ‘double G’ bucklesI have to tell you, however, that the era of the boring belt is over. This summer’s belt is sexy! And decorative, too. I’m talking polka dots, colour pops, studs, chains — you name it, it’s got it, with bells on.The point is to give whatever outfit you’re wearing a kick. And after a little dithering, I’ve decided I’m not going to hide from the trend.After all, if I don’t need a belt to be functional and hoist up my trousers (my midriff is doing that very efficiently, thank you very much), then it may as well be beautiful.

 Note the belt’s catwalk rebirth, everywhere from Prada’s multiple studs and Versace’s gilt Medusa buckles to Celine’s giant waist-claspers that resemble horse-shoes-cum- doorknockers.But no designer has done more for modern belt worship than Alessandro Michele, creative director of Gucci.You may gasp in wonder at the sheer theatricality of his fashion, but for every oddball costume seen on the runway, there’s a desirable and do-able belt on gucci.com — 65 of them to be precise.         Pictured is a statement belt seen during Celine's Spring/Summer 2018 show in Paris And these, with their distinctive interlocking ‘double G’ buckles — bejeweled (£450) or plain (£270) — are what all the fashion world is wearing.Sales of designer belts are going through the roof. Tina Lamb, buying manager of women’s shoes and accessories at Harvey Nichols, says sales have rocketed for belt brands, but particularly Gucci: ‘The classic GG buckle belt in leather is this year’s sell-out style.’Designer website Net-a-Porter also sees Gucci’s double G belt among its bestsellers and has had to boost its selection of belts by more than half due to the high demand.Meanwhile, online retailer ShopBop says Moschino and Balmain belts are its most popular brands.But for those who don’t want to flaunt their designer credentials with a bold logo — still a daunting prospect for those of us who came of age in the logo-loving Eighties — or splash that much cash on a single belt, there are economical alternatives out there.Both River Island’s light blue stirrup buckle belt (£14, riverisland.com) and Jaeger’s animal-print belt (£45, jaeger.co.uk) will provide a stylish accent to any pair of jeans or summer dress. STATEMENT BELTS: THE RULES  Boring belts are out this season, so there’s no excuse for plain black.Play with textures — try a suede belt with a wooden buckle.Consider a statement belt instead of jewellery for an evening look.This spring’s belts are worn on the hips rather than as waist cinchers.  Note the belt’s transformative powers: try one that resembles jewellery to convert your plain day dress into a head-turning evening-worthy look, such as Uterque’s sculptural gold chain belt (£69, uterque.com).On a styling note, the new belts look best sitting on the hips. Thank the Lord! A wasp waist is totally unachievable at this stage anyway.What looks really modern right now is the belted jacket. Take any tailored jacket and belt it with a contrast colour, print or fabric.See my two favourite High Street haunts for brilliant examples: Mango’s linen-blend midi-dress (£59.99) strapped with a wide wooden buckle belt (£17.99, mango.com) and Zara’s check blazer (£89.99) belted with chocolate leather (£29.99, zara.com).Above all, remember that belts are wardrobe classics and don’t really date.
