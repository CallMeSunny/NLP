Main man: Frankie Gavin celebrates after winning the British and Commonwealth welterweight titles The British champion dominated the opening three rounds but was forced back onto the ropes in the fifth as Vassell briefly came into the bout.Gavin was causing havoc with his trusty left hand, though, and reasserted his dominance in the next two rounds.And a fearsome shot to the jaw saw the fight stopped, following a doctor's inspection after the seventh round.      Dominant: Gavin was on top from the first bell as he forced Vassell to retire at the end of the seventh round       On the undercard, Paul Butler defended his Commonwealth super-flyweight title and raised hopes of a world title shot with a fourth-round stoppage of late stand-in Najah Ali.The Merseysider put his opponent on the canvas early on and finished him off with a brutal left hook in the fourth.
