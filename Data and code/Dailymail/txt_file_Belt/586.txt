Capital to get a liberal dose of laughing gas  By Nikita Puri   Published: 00:16 BST, 22 June 2012  |  Updated: 00:59 BST, 22 June 2012                     View  comments   This weekend, keep those tissues handy and grab a seat with a seat belt lest you roll on the floor laughing with tears in your eyes. As the Capital sees 16 of the best comedians sharing the spotlight backed by Shoelace Productions over two-days, it's rightly titled, a 'Losers' Night Out.' Deepak Dhamija, the Delhibased IIM Calcutta graduate who read scripts as he pretended to be a venture capitalist says, 'After the fabricated success of 'Bar Boys,' we wanted to give people the biggest line-up of comedians Delhi has ever seen.'       Along with Raghav Mandava (above), 15 stand-up comedians promise to have Delhi in splits during the Losers¿ Night Out Neeti Palta, one of the few female stand-up comedians in the country, talks about how comedy may not pay you enough to get you a seafacing house in Bandra, but it didn't stop her from sneaking around her parents back to perfect her stand-up act. Also performing this weekend is Raghav Mandava, who has given the city a good dose of social satire and dark humour. For him it's a challenge to know when to stop - the line between offstage and onstage lives is a blurry one. 'I always have to have the last word since 'I got involved with comedy,' he forewarns as you get ready to watch his act.  'Losers' Night Out' will be on at LTG Auditorium on June 23 and 24.
