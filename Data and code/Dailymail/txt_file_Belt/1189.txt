With an impressive 12 Olympic medals under belt, Natalie Coughlin, 33, is (rightfully) known for her swimming prowess, not her make-up skills. Still, with the amount of time she spends in the pool, we can think of few people better suited for putting waterproof cosmetics to the test.Apparently, we're not the only ones.After Natalie dropped out of the running to go to this year's games, Buzzfeed tapped her for a video in which she applies various mascaras, eyeliners and lipsticks to see which ones really hold up in the water.Scroll for video              Girl you don't need make-up: Twelve-time Olympic medalist Natalie Coughlin, 33, says she has never worn cosmetics at the games         Dive in! After withdrawing from this year's competition, Natalie teamed up with Buzzfeed to test waterproof make-up at a pool in California         Is it running down my face? Natalie puts mascaras, eyeliners and lipsticks to the underwater challengeDespite her affinity toward bold make-up when she's not in the water, Natalie admits she's never worn it during Olympic competition.'There was this girl when I was younger who would wear mascara and it would run down her face after every race, so that's kind of been a fear of mine,' she says in the video.Sunscreen, though, is a different story. Before she begins her make-up testing, she whips out an Amore Pacific cushion compact foundation that contains SPF. 'I need my sunscreen when I get in the pool,' she says. 'Also, it'll cover up this zit that I picked this morning - bad idea.'         Two thumbs up: Natalie was impressed with the way the first two products stayed put                SHOP THE LOOK, FROM LEFT    Kat Von D Beauty Tattoo Liner ($20, sephora.com)Dior Diorshow Iconic Extreme Waterproof Definition Lash Curler Mascara ($29.50, nordstrom.com) While applying the first product, a tattoo eyeliner from Kat Von D Beauty, Natalie says,  'I feel like a little kid using a crayon, and I'm like coloring outside the lines right now.'She pairs the eyeliner with a Dior Diorshow waterproof mascara, really going for it by coating both her top and bottom lashes.'You're not putting mascara on right unless you're making a funny face,' she says.When she emerges from her dip in the pool (complete with dive and underwater swimming), she's pleasantly surprised by the results. The results: 'Actually this held up really well - like really, really well. And I even rubbed this eye quite a bit. I'm impressed. Two thumbs up on both the Dior and the Kat Von D. My lashes look kind of chunky right now just because they're wet, but it's not dripping down my face like I was worried about.'           No feeling blue for her: The Olympian said she'd wear this look poolside in Las Vegas                SHOP THE LOOK, FROM LEFT    Sephora Collection Long-Lasting 12 HR Wear Eye Liner in Fancy Blue ($12, sephora.com)Too Faced Better Than Sex Waterproof Mascara ($23, ulta.com)   Next up is a Sephora Collection electric blue liquid eyeliner and another cult-favorite waterproof mascara from Too Faced.'This is definitely a fun [look]. Maybe for festival season or poolside in Vegas,' Natalie says of the vivid liner. 'I got some all over my eyelashes, but I think that's user error more than anything.'The results: 'It held up pretty well. None of the blue seemed to move. Again the mascara got all clumpy from me being in the water, but the eyeliner didn't seem to budge at all.'                Red hot: Both the prestige and drugstore liquid lipsticks Natalie tried didn't budge in water                SHOP THE LOOK, FROM LEFT    Kat Von D Beauty Everlasting Liquid Lipstick in Outlaw ($20, katvondbeauty.com)Revlon ColorStay Ultimate Liquid Lipstick in Top Tomato ($10, walgreens.com)   Natalie tried two liquid lipsticks, one from a high-end brand and one from a mass brand, for her last challenges.Swiping on a bright red Kat Von D color, she says, 'This would be good for me because my lips turn blue because I'm always so cold in the water.As for a Revlon version, Natalie liked the deep red color and its accessibility, saying, 'This is nice because it's a drugstore brand, so you can get it pretty much anywhere.' The results: Neither lipstick smudged or budged. 'I've never worn lipstick while swimming, but I think this one's a winner,' Natalie says after her Kat Von D test.               Go bold or go home: The swimmer, who has also competed on Dancing with the Stars, has been known to rock a red lip (left) or blue, smoky eye (right) when she's not in the waterSo does this mean she'll start regularly wearing make-up while swimming now? Probably not.'I traditionally have not looked for waterproof make-up just because I don't tend to wear make-up when I'm in the pool,' she says. 'But if I was going to lounge by the pool with my friends or I was going to the beach and I wanted to add a little something, I will now check out some waterproof stuff.'Too Faced might have been my favorite one. And this [blue liner] stayed really well; I'll just have to get a professional to put it on for me.'
