 Anthony Joshua can add the WBA heavyweight title to his IBF belt when he fights Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium on Saturday. Here, Press Association Sport takes a statistical look at the Briton’s career. 18 – Joshua has had only 18 professional fights, yet is the favourite to beat one of the finest heavyweight champions in history. 100 – per cent of wins he has achieved by knockout, having stopped all 18 of his professional opponents inside the distance.        Anthony Joshua, right, knocks down Charles Martin (Nick Potts/PA)  3 – the number of world heavyweight title fights he has been involved in – against American trio Charles Martin, Dominic Breazeale, and Eric Molina. 3 – the number of recognised professional titles Joshua has won. He is the reigning IBF heavyweight champion, and once held both the British and Commonwealth titles.        Anthony Joshua, left, in action against Michael Sprott (Peter Byrne/PA)  5 – five of Joshua’s 18 opponents were stopped inside a round. Emanuele Leo, Hector Alfredo Avila, Matt Legg, Michael Sprott and Gary Cornish were all unable to survive even three minutes with him. 7 – the highest number of rounds any of Joshua’s fights have lasted. First Dillian Whyte and then Breazeale proved his most resilient opponents.        Wladimir Klitschko won gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics as an amateur for Ukraine (John Walton/PA)  6 – Joshua’s age in years when Klitschko won Olympic gold at Atlanta ’96. 1 – Olympic gold medals won. Joshua’s came at London 2012. 44 – the number of rounds he has boxed as a professional. Klitschko surpasses that in his five most recent fights alone. 90,000 – the number of spectators expected to attend Saturday’s fight, a post-war record for a boxing event in the UK.
