Now majority of councils plan to concrete over the green belt - even after being told to do so only in 'exceptional circumstances'Just over half of councils with green belt 'likely or very likely' to develop it By Ben Spencer for the Daily Mail   Published: 01:19 BST, 19 December 2013  |  Updated: 08:49 BST, 19 December 2013    


         e-mail          23 View  comments    More than half of councils are planning to build on green belt land, casting doubt on Government claims that protected areas would only be developed in ‘exceptional circumstances’.Research for the National Trust has found that 51 per cent of English authorities with green belt land were ‘likely or very likely’ to allocate it for development within the next five years.More than half of the 147 local authorities that responded to the survey said they had brownfield sites available that could help meet housing targets, but developers did not see them as viable locations for projects.         A cow stands in green belt land at Radlett, near St Albans: More than half of English authorities with green belt land were ¿likely or very likely¿ to allocate it for development within the next five years, a survey found  Sir Simon Jenkins, chairman of the National Trust, said last night: ‘The green belt has been the star feature of town and country planning for half a century.‘In one of Europe’s most congested countries, it has prevented urban sprawl, protected a vision of rural England and retained access to green spaces for urban dwellers that has been admired worldwide.’ Just over 12 per cent of England is designated as green belt, a status introduced in the 1950s to protect the countryside around major towns and cities from urban sprawl.The survey, carried out by the Local Government Information Unit, comes 18 months after the Government put in place its National Planning Policy Framework, which aimed to speed up decisions and boost housebuilding.Councils were told that green belt land could only be developed in ‘exceptional circumstances’. But they were also ordered to allocate sufficient land to meet future housing needs. Crucially, the guidance shifted the ‘presumption in favour of sustainable development’.Earlier this year, the Campaign to Protect Rural England said the number of houses planned for Green Belt land had nearly doubled to 150,000 in the previous 12 months.Sir Simon said: ‘The Government’s definition of “sustainable” is in practice being interpreted as “profitable”, and has effectively killed the former planning presumption in favour of brownfield land.‘What is now happening is a policy of let rip, leading to steady erosion. For the first time in British planning history, planning control is now the slave not the master of profit.’         Natural beauty: Just over 12 per cent of England is designated as green belt, a status introduced in the 1950s to protect the countryside around major towns and cities from urban sprawl  Labour’s shadow planning minister Roberta Blackman-Woods said last night: ‘David Cameron and [communities secretary] Eric Pickles significantly weakened Labour’s brownfield-first policy which actively prioritised building on brownfield sites.‘The Government needs to strengthen the brownfield policy and explain how it will continue to protect our valuable countryside and green spaces given the findings of this survey that show land of high environmental value being put at risk from inappropriate development.’        Liberal: Planning Minister Nick Boles said the Coalition was doing more to protect the green belt than the previous government under Labour  But Planning Minister Nick Boles, defending his policies, said: ‘The coalition Government has safeguarded national green belt protection, abolished Labour’s regional strategies which threatened to rip up the green belt, and introduced a new protection for valuable green spaces.‘The biggest threat to the green belt is Ed Miliband’s plans to allow urban councils to dump development on their rural neighbours.’ The survey, carried out by the Local Government Information Unit, asked 147 senior planning officers and councillors their plans.Of those, 59 respondents had green belt land in their local authority area, of which 51 per cent said they were likely or very likely to allocate it for development within five years.More than half of the 147 local authorities that responded to the survey said they had brownfield sites available that could help meet housing targets, but had not been considered viable.Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the Local Government Information Unit which carried out the survey, said: ‘This research shows that the National Planning Police Framework and targets around housing supply are putting significant strain on councils’ ability to protect the green belt.’ Ingrid Samuel, historic environment director at the National Trust, added: ‘What councils are saying is alarming.‘We need more homes and, if agreed in approved local plans, some of these may be built on previously undeveloped land, but the priority should remain brownfield first.’ Conservative MP Nick de Bois, who has fought to protect green belt land in his Enfield North constituency, added: ‘Ministers were right to promise to protect the green belt and prioritise brownfield site developments but competing interests, pressure on housing supply and the presumption of sustainable development mean reckless councils are clearly planning to build over the green belt as the easy more profitable option.’
