How do you stay looking so blah blah blah.” I've had plastic surgery. I've talked about that. That doesn't matter.‘What matters is realising you can always get better.

Aging gracefully: The icon believes that older people ‘have a greater sense of well-being,’ and it seems to show‘It started maybe six or seven months ago,’ she said. ‘I have to be very intentional about keeping myself grounded and centred.

I took my cues from him and threw myself into the threesome with the skill and enthusiasm of the actress that I am.’Jane confessed: ‘I’ll tell you what I did enjoy. The mornings after, when Vadim was gone and the woman and I would linger over our coffee and talk.          Lovely ladies: The mother-of-three posed with Michele Elizabeth, while wearing an exotic black and gold outer garment over sleek black trousers and gold pointed-toe flats 'For me it was a way to bring some humanity to the relationship, an antidote to the objectification.’Meanwhile, Jane can next be seen in the Netflix series, Grace And Frankie, which debuts in May.She and Lily Tomlin play two women whose husbands come out as gay and leave their wives for each other.The mother-of-three finds the story refreshing.‘You so often see women in our media competing with each other,’ she said. ‘I like that [Grace and Frankie] is two women befriending each other.
