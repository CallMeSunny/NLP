 ‘Where local councils come forward with sensible, robust local plans – and are willing to take the tough decisions – I will back them all the way,’ he said.‘For example, Birmingham City Council has put forward a plan to meet some of its local housing need by removing green belt designation from a small area of land.‘They’ve looked at all the options. They’ve considered all the implications. They want to build homes for their children and grandchildren. And Westminster politicians should not stand in the way of that.’         Sajid Javid, the Local Government Secretary, has indicated he backs the plans for land swapsAndrew Mitchell, the Tory MP for Sutton Coldfield where the green belt homes near Birmingham will be built, criticised the plan: ‘We face horrific proposals from the Labour council and are frankly astonished that Sajid Javid has not stood by the Conservative’s manifesto commitment to defend the green belt.‘He himself said the green belt is absolutely sacrosanct. We are therefore at a loss to know why the Government is unable to protect us from these iniquitous proposals. There is nothing that causes more anger among the electorate than being let down in this way.’Nigel Mills, the Conservative MP for Amber Valley, said: ‘We have always said that green belt land is untouchable except in exceptional circumstances, that’s what we should stick to.’Paul Miner, planning campaign manager at the Campaign to Protect Rural England said: ‘We are concerned that his could be charter for developers and encourage local authorities to release large swathes of green belt with little justification.‘Once it’s gone, it’s gone forever. It’s generally found that the green belt is performing an important function in stopping urban sprawl.’          A row over the green belt has broken out in Theresa May’s own constituency of MaidenheadA row over the green belt has broken out in Theresa May’s own constituency of Maidenhead, where eight out of ten new homes planned are due to be built on protected areas.The local authority there has set itself a target of building 700 new houses a year until 2032.But plans to erect the buildings on the green belt are opposed by local Lib Dems, who have set up a petition urging residents to oppose it.A post on Mrs May’s website, made before she was MP, said she had campaigned against ‘excessive development’: ‘Maidenhead and the surrounding areas face immense pressure for more residential development. 'This part of Berkshire is a great place to live and we want to keep its character. That’s why Theresa has a track record of campaigning against overdevelopment. Theresa opposes any weakening of the rules which protect the countryside from excessive development, such as regional development targets.’‘Theresa is regularly in touch with both Wokingham Borough Council and the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead to ensure they are listening to local residents’ views on development proposals. 'She meets local residents to discuss development issues and she has campaigned against inappropriate large-scale developments and will continue to fight to preserve the character of our local area.’ g.peev@dailymail.co.uk
