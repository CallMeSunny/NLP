   Fury said: ‘There’s lots to exploit about Joshua, there’s a lot of weaknesses and vulnerabilities and I believe I can take advantage of that.‘It’s the fight I’m dying for, and when I get past Pulev I believe I’ll be victorious against Joshua. I was rubbing my hands seeing that fight.’Fury’s thoughts largely echo those of his cousin, who is due to step into the ring to fight Deontay Wilder in December – the winner of which being favourite to face Joshua at Wembley on April 13.         The Stockport-born fighter suffered a tight points defeat to Joseph Parker in September 2017Fury, 24, has lost just once in 22 bouts since turning professional aged 18 in 2013, in a tight points decision to Joseph Parker in September 2017. A win against Pulev would push him towards the front of the queue for a bout against IBF, WBO, WBA and IBO champion Joshua.The Stockport-born fighter believes he is in the shape of his career and is ready for another title shot – going as far as offering to fight Joshua at the booked Wembley date.Fury said: ‘I feel a different person to when I faced Parker a year ago and I’m doing everything to get back to the top.'I believe I’m ready right now.‘I want that fight as soon as possible and if he’s got a date in April I’ll take it.‘All I’ve got to say to him is I’m coming for you, you can’t duck me for ever. I’ll be coming for you, don’t worry about that.’              Fury believes that Joshua has several weaknesses he can take advantage of in the ringBefore the prospect of Joshua though, Fury must negotiate 37-year-old Pulev, who’s only defeat in 26 fights came against Wladimir Klitschko in November 2014.Pulev was also forced to pull out of his own title fight against Joshua a year ago due to injury, with Carlos Takam taking his place and losing by knockout.While it’s widely considered a risk to fight Pulev in his own backyard, Fury has no qualms about the location.He added: ‘I’ve got my chances by letting my fists do the talking.‘I’m going to go over to his back garden, and we’ll see on October 27 there’s no reason for me to speak.‘I believe I’m the best and if you’re the best you’ll fight anyone anywhere.‘I don’t care about money or fame I just want to get to the top and win world titles and I’ll go wherever I have to to get there.‘I’m not underestimating Pulev whatsoever but I’m going to take full advantage of him.‘I hope he brings his best but believe me I will have an answer for everything he brings.’Fire & Fury: Pulev vs Fury will be broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5 on Saturday, October 27.          Before a shot at Joshua, Fury takes on Kubrat Pulev in the IBF mandatory eliminator in Bulgaria   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Anthony Joshua has everyone where he wants them, he is able...
