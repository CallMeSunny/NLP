 'I want to be undefeated and retire undefeated,' she said. 'Maybe I will hold two belts in the future and maybe that will happen next year.'We need that division. I heard about it a long time ago but it's finally happened.'For me, making weight is easy but if you want to think about the future - about being a mother, a partner, a fighter and an athlete - we must be serious about our bodies and our health.'It's a good idea to open the division - so many from bantamweight will drop down and so many from 115lb will go up.         She fights Claudia Gadelha on Friday night in Las Vegas as she aims to retain her strawweight title         Jedrzejczyk took part in an open training session for her supporters at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino'JoJo prepared really well and she finished the fight.'Since eking out a split-decision victory over Gadelha in 2014, Jedrzejczyk stopped Carla Esparza and Jessica Penne before Letourneau took her the five-round distance last November.Her fight with Gadelha will bring a conclusion to the pair's feud which reached a crescendo during the most recent season of The Ultimate Fighter.'The preparations have gone pretty well and smooth and without injuries,' Jedrzejczyk said.'I challenge myself day-by-day and this camp was pretty tough. I know I'm ready and I cannot wait until Friday.         She believes that the UFC division should be opened up so that fighters can take part in more fights'The Ultimate Fighter was all real, I was not playing. I said what I said and I did what I did.'But in our regular lives, we accept people and some of the people we don't accept.'I know that she wants to take my belt, my life, my dreams and my goals away from me and I can't let her do that.'I feel stronger, not just physically but mentally as well. I'm getting more and more confident for this fight. I hope it will be Fight of the Year.         She adds that she knows Gadelha will be aiming to take her title from her but she will refuse to back down'Our first fight was close but it was 19 months ago. I've fought three times since; I did 10 rounds and she has had just one three-round fight [a unanimous decision victory over Jessica Aguilar].'I have more experience and I feel strong enough to beat her.'I really respect her and her skills but it's time to prove once more to her, her coaches and her team that I am the only one at strawweight.'Some people think it's about the hype and the fame but it's all about being the best and challenging myself every day.'
