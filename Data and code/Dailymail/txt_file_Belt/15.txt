 BEIJING, April 25 (Reuters) - China aims to make the Belt and Road Initiative sustainable and prevent debt risks, finance minister Liu Kun said at a forum on Thursday, adding that Beijing will support financing via multiple channels. Yi Gang, the central bank governor, said at the Belt and Road Forum that local currencies will be used for investments related to China's Belt and Road Initiative to curb exchange rate risks. China will follow market principles and rely on commercial funds for Belt and Road financing, Yi said. (Reporting by Kevin Yao Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
