She's previously been hailed a style icon because of her extensive collection of sharp-cut floral blazers. But now Mary Berry has been labelled a 'gangster' for wearing a £495 Hermès Vintage H buckle belt on The Great British Bake Off. One fan joked that the 80-year-old, who is usually spotted in less showy garments by the likes of Marks & Spencer and Zara, must have 'left her Birkin & Louboutins in the other little tent'. The gold buckle belt by the luxury French fashion house has previously been seen on professional boxer Floyd Mayweather, flashy TOWIE star Joey Essex and attention-grabbing TV presenter Rylan Clark. Scroll down for video          Mary Berry has been labelled a 'gangster' for wearing a £495 Hermès Vintage H buckle belt on The Great British Bake Off

 Another praised the look adding: '#GBBO Mary Berry is literally the only person who could wear a H logo Hermes belt and look classy.' While another eagle-eyed audience member joked: 'Mary berry is so gansta with a hermès belt on. [sic]'.         The gold buckle belt is from luxury French design house Hermès vintage range and can be found on boutiques online                                     One fan joked that 80-year-old Mary, who is usually spotted in less showy garments by the likes of Marks & Spencer and Zara, must have 'left her Birkin & Louboutins in the other little tent'         Those hoping to emulate the petite cook's look can find it in an array on colours on online outlets such as Farfetch, second-hand boutique Vestiaire Collective and auction site eBayMary's extravagant belt is made of black leather and features the Hermès 'H' logo in gold. It is from the design house's vintage line. Those hoping to emulate the petite cook's look can find it in an array on colours on online outlets such as Farfetch, second-hand boutique Vestiaire Collective and auction site eBay. Other fans commenting on Mary's statement buckle said she was 'trendy', 'Miss fancy' and 'legit style goals'.   'Mary Berry rocking the Hermès belt, she is legit style goals', said one admirer.  'Check out Mary Berry and her Hermès belt! Miss fancy! #GBBO15,' joked another.While one Berry lover said: 'Is Mary Berry wearing a Halston or Hermes belt? Which ever, she is way trendier than me. #GBBO.'         It is not the first time that Mary's clothes have courted more attention that the contestant's cakes.  In 2012 she caused a frenzy after stepping out in a £29.99 silk bomber jacket by Zara. The neon floral-print number sold out nationwide and attracted bids of up to £200 on auction site eBay.Last year, Marks & Spencer reported that their 'Limited Edition' stork-print bomber jacket sold out online in less than 60 minutes after Mary was spotted wearing it on the Bake Off. Speaking about her statement style Mary told Glamour last year, ‘Well, I hope that I dress for my age. Because there’s no need to be dowdy, is there?‘But most things are totally unsuitable for somebody of 79. You have to really hunt at my age because an arm is not beautiful at this stage. Also a fairly high neck is a good thing.’ Paul Hollywood's pal hinted that she'll bring out her own line in the future which would feature 'stylish cuts in durable fabrics that hem well and don’t crease'.          The Only Way Is Essex star Joey Essex was spotted wearing the luxury belt but with a silver buckle in 2014              Professional American boxer Floyd Mayweather, pictured left, and TV presenter Rylan Clark, right, have also been spotted in the design
