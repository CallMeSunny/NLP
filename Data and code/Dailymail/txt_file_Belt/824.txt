If you open your suitcase after leaving the airport with damaged goods inside, this might be the reason why.An airport luggage conveyor belt has a novel way of separating bags into the correct queues - but it's a somewhat cut and thrust job.As the suitcases whizz round on the belt, out of nowhere a mechanical arm slams into the bags and and thrusts them onto a lower track.                The red and black luggage moves along the conveyor after being taken from the plane         Suddenly the mechanical arm springs into action giving the luggage some brute force         And with a sharp movement, the red and black case is passed down onto a lower conveyor beltThe mechanism appears to work on a sensor system, ensuring it strikes out at the centre of the luggage so as to not spin it, but what might shock is the force of the action.It is not known where this video was taken, although it is believed to be an international airport.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Welcome to Utah's incredible Goblin Valley where erosion has...

 However baggage pushers like this are used at airports all over the world, with Dutch company Vanderlande market leaders in the machinery.Their 'Parallel Pusher,' similar to the one in this video, is a widely used horizontal divert pusher that sorts single bags to one destination only. When the pusher is activated, a pusher plate operates at 90 degrees to the transport direction and pushes the bag into a destination or onto a connection conveyor.          This suitcase is set for a ride on a different conveyor in a matter of seconds         The arm extends out to separate the luggage in the hope it arrives with its ownerThe video, after being uploaded to YouTube, has been met with mixed responses.User Stephanie O wrote: 'This is the real reason why your baggage is destroyed at the airport', while Sarah Cartwright added: 'Vicious airport baggage packer.' DMTRYP says what most people would think on viewing the video, writing: 'Hope none of the souvenirs were made out of glass or ceramics.'
