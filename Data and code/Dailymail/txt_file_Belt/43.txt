China said on Tuesday said 'the door will always remain open' to India joining its One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative, but did not offer any new ideas to resolve the issue of the 'flagship' project, the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), passing through Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK).China also questioned India's statement on Saturday that called for 'meaningful dialogue' with China on the issue, saying that China was 'always waiting' for talks.'I do not know what the Indian spokesperson was trying to say,' Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said.         Chinese President Xi Jinping waves with leaders attending the Belt and Road Forum (Pictured -Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Xi, Indonesian President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo and Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, and second row from third left to right, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desaleg)         The national flags of Pakistan, left, and China are displayed on the side of a mountain in Gwadar, Balochistan,'What kind of dialogue is meaningful dialogue? What kind of positive attitude does the spokesman want China to hold? I think our position has also been clear and we are always waiting. If they have the answer, they can give me the answer in a public or private way.'At the same time, Hua said China 'welcomes the participation of India to the Belt and Road Initiative', when asked about India being the only major country absent at Sunday's first Belt and Road Forum (BRF) in Beijing.         Satish Acharya on One Belt, One Road One Belt, One RoadÂ   Gwadar is the cornerstone of Chinese President Xi Jinping's so-called One Belt, One Road project to rebuild the ancient Silk Road, a trading route connecting China to the Arabian Sea that slices through the Himalayas and crosses deserts and disputed territory to reach this ancient fishing port, about 500 miles by boat from Dubai.  'Now it depends on what attitude the Indian side holds,' Hua added.'We know more than 130 countries attended the forum. Our door will always remain open and we will always welcome the participation of the Indian side.Over past four years since we proposed the BRI, we have always held the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. Our ideas and actions are clear to all, and you can see that from the response from the international community.'In a statement to India Today on Monday, China similarly said that 'the international community's support speaks volumes' as it dismissed the concerns voiced by India's ministry of external affairs in a statement on the eve of the summit, which in addition to India's concerns on CPEC also questioned the wider principles underpinning OBOR, stating that 'connectivity initiatives must be based on universally recognised international norms, good governance, rule of law, openness, transparency and equality' and 'avoid projects that would create unsustainable-debt burden for communities'.
