Death is an expensive business. The cost of a basic funeral is now about £3,600 – double the price of a decade ago. The Mail on Sunday shows how you can avoid a conveyor belt funeral service and opt for a more personalised send-off, while still saving money.The cost of funerals is soaring – fuelled by big chains eager to boost their profits, and increasingly cash-hungry local authorities. These organisations are exploiting the fear surrounding one of the two certainties of life – death and taxes.Death is a time of grief and upheaval. It means family rarely bat an eyelid at the cost of a funeral. But shopping around can save you money and ensure your loved one gets a more personal funeral service.

The largest is the 1,100-strong chain run by Dignity while The Co-operative Funeralcare has 800 branches. There are also more than 1,000 independent funeral directors – businesses that have often been in the same family for generations.Margaret Armstrong, 65, from Liverpool, organised the funeral for her 87-year-old mother Peggy Blair, when she died three years ago.   More...

Find expert advice   The retired secondary school teacher says: ‘Fortunately, I did not use the first funeral director I contacted but found a local independent director, Peter Coyne, who provided a good value, personalised service without forcing me to pay unnecessary extras.’         Personal: Margaret Armstrong paid £5,000 for her mother’s funeralMargaret says the cost was still more than £5,000. This included the burial of Peggy’s ashes alongside her husband Leslie, who died aged 73 in 1997, at Anfield Cemetery in Stanley Park, which lies close to the famous stadium of Liverpool Football Club.Margaret adds: ‘At my father’s funeral there was a home match being played and you could hear the crowd in the Kop singing “You’ll never walk alone”. He was a Liverpool fan and it was a special moment – it made my hairs stand on end.’Independent funeral directors are likely to be more flexible than big national chains that often try to sell unnecessary ‘luxuries’ as part of funeral packages – such as brass handles and solid wooden coffins.Contact The National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors for more details. Comparison website Funeral Choice can also help you find good value directors.Over the last year the cost of a cremation has risen more than 6 per cent to an average £662 as cash-strapped councils look for new ways to rake in money. With space a premium in overcrowded cemeteries, a burial plot now typically costs about £1,750. Add to these charges the costs for handling the body of a deceased person, coffins, funeral directors’ fees plus a ceremony, and the bills soon mount to nearly £3,600. If you include ‘extras’ – memorials, flowers, catering and legal fees – a funeral will cost nearly £8,500, according to research by insurer SunLife.The ‘extras’ can be the easiest items to cut back on. These include a typical £230 for additional limo hire, £150 for flowers, £140 for death and funeral notices, £772 for a memorial stone, £60 service orders, £370 for catering and £110 for the hire of a venue for the wake. Instead, you can use your own vehicles, create and print your own order of service, provide the pallbearers and sort out your own wake, perhaps at the local pub. Dean Lamble, managing director at SunLife, says: ‘Unexpected bills often come at an emotional time when families might not feel up to taking control and planning all the details of the funeral.’  THE 10 QUESTIONS WE ARE AFRAID TO ASK When will I die?Hard to predict. For men, average life expectancy is 79 and for women 82. Websites such as Deathclock and Deathtimer provide estimates – but plan ahead.How much will a funeral cost?About £3,600 will get youa basic funeral. If you want all the trimmings – memorial, flowers and a solicitor to administer the estate – it may total nearly £8,500.Can I choose between a cremation and burial?The number of people cremated overtook those buried in 1968 – and now accounts for 70 per cent of funerals. You may get cremated unless you have planned ahead.Do I need to book a burial plot now?Yes. Contact your local authority. It may cost £1,500 but in areas such as London all cemeteries are expected to be full by 2030. A ‘Grant of Exclusive Right of Burial’ typically lasts from 25 to 100 years. After then you could be dug up and moved to other consecrated ground.What about a tailor-made send off?Absolutely. Do not get bullied into a packaged deal promoted by one of the large funeral chains. Opt for a private funeral company that is happy to offer a full breakdown of options and fees.Can I be buried under a tree?Yes. It can also work out a lot cheaper than being buried in a cemetery. Contact The Natural Death Centre for details of local woodland burial grounds. You can be buried in your back garden – but contact the Environment Agency for guidance.What is the cheapest option?You can have a ‘disposal-only’ cremation for about £1,000 that can be just as respectful and does not involve any ceremony. A wake can be held later on.Do I need to budget ahead?There are two main ways people tend to plan for a future funeral – either through a pre-paid plan or opting for an insurance policy to cover costs. A plan enables you to pay for a tailor-made send off at today’s prices while insurance targeted at the over-50s is best value if you do not live long, but the policy can lapse if you fail to keep up payments.Will I get a pauper’s funeral if I have no money?Around one in seven people struggle to pay for a funeral. The State offers £700 towards costs and funeral directors might push you to the unpopular ‘9 o’clock cemetery slot’ if there are financial issues.What about writing a will?It is important to write a will so final wishes can be made about how your estate is divided. Campaigner Will Aid is offering a free will-writing service this month to those willing to give to charity.There are certain costs, such as a doctor’s death certificate, cremation or burial fees that cannot be avoided but embalming is unnecessary.Natural burial sites are increasingly popular with families who prefer a simple funeral in woodland and they can work out cheaper than a gravestone and plot in a cemetery. Details of 270 natural burial sites, plus funeral advice, are available from The Natural Death Centre website.Rosie Inman-Cook, manager of The Natural Death Centre in Twyford, Hampshire, says: ‘The funeral industry often tries to make people feel guilty about skimping but even then you can end up with a production line funeral service that has no resemblance to what was really wanted.’ She adds: ‘Often the big expense is a plot at a cemetery which is almost full. For far less money you can choose a peaceful rural location.’For example, a countryside plot in Dorset might cost you £450 compared to a cemetery plot that is likely to cost more than three times as much. Rosie says: ‘Rather than buying a wooden coffin you could also consider a cheaper cardboard version for just £170 – or an English wicker coffin costing £550.’         Wacky: The coffin that is shaped like a skipA green send-off is not the only alternative twist you can add to the funeral arrangements. Coffins now come in all sorts of shapes and designs – everything from one decorated in the colours of a favourite football team to one shaped like a Viking burial ship or even a rubbish skip. Specialist coffin makers include Crazy Coffins of Bulwell, Nottingham, which also offers handmade urns in different shapes – from beer bottles to owls.For the most straightforward funeral with a minimum of fuss and cost, a so-called ‘express’ funeral can cover all necessities for under £1,000. Funeral directors also refer to these as a ‘disposal service’ but rarely promote this option as it offers them less opportunity to make profits. The price includes collecting the body, cremation and returning the ashes in a simple urn. It may sound impersonal but it can suit those who do not want a crematorium ceremony.Gordon Tulley, funeral director for Respect Funeral Services in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, says: ‘Although it may be called a disposal service, everything is done with the utmost respect.’ He adds: ‘Often family and friends will mark the death later with a special personal event.’The cost of legal fees can also be cut if you are willing to do much of the legwork yourself – especially if you are the named executor – with charities such as Citizens Advice offering free help.
