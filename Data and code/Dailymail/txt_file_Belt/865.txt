 Reacting to the High Court decision, she said: 'It just makes a mockery of the whole planning system, that decision just gives the green light to travellers everywhere.'As for us I'm really concerned, that's an appalling decision as it is on Green Belt land.'It's an absolute joke.'Another local, who did not want to be named out of fear of reprisals, said: 'I'm absolutely disgusted, it's an injunction after all.'I just can't believe it, this means to me that anyone can do what they want planning wise on Green Belt land.'They can just go there, live there and do what they want while we deal with the consequences.'         Mr Justice Singh's decision has been slammed as 'appalling' by angry campaignersThe site was covered by an injunction on October 18 2016 preventing development of the land, but in February this year work started.Footage filmed by angry locals captured lorries flying on to the sprawling site, which has now been covered in hardcore and asphalt.Septic tanks have also been buried deep into the ground and wooden fencing has sprung up around the edge of the land.Council chiefs have slapped the travellers with planning breaches but there was no time for their case to be argued in court.Basildon Council's injunction also restricted occupation of the land to those living there at the time, but this was changed.This was secured against the Tidd family, John Hilden, George Davis and 'persons unknown' but a parcel of the relevant land was subsequently sold to Michael Smith, who moved onto the site with 10 others.The group applied to the court to vary the injunction, allowing them to stay, and for the changed layout of caravans and mobile homes, wooden sheds and the fencing surrounding the pitches to remain in place.A spokesman for the council said: 'This application was heard ahead of the committal proceedings brought by Basildon Council against the defendants for breaching the injunction and a further application seeking the court's authority to enter the land and remove the offending caravans, hardstanding and fencing.         Locals fear more building work is imminent on the traveller site with more than 50 families expected to pitch up'Despite the council's strong objections, Mr Justice Singh allowed the injunction to be varied which means that the travellers can remain on the site, substituting their names on the order for the Tidd family, who no longer occupy the land.'The time spent dealing with the defendants application meant that there was insufficient court time available for the council's own applications to be heard and the judge felt it was appropriate to give further directions to deal with this application.'A further hearing will be arranged for this to happen, which will not take place before 23 June.'Some fear the completed site could eventually dwarf Dale Farm, in nearby Crays Hill, which at its height was home to more than 1,000 people.         TheWickford site is roughly 3.5 miles away from the infamous Dale Farm which cost Basildon Council more than £7million to clear after a pitched eviction battle.The council is still reeling from the pitched battle it funded to remove the travellers from Dale Farm.It was once the largest illegal travellers' site in Europe and in October 2011 the six acres of land were finally cleared amid scenes of violence as travellers and campaigners clashed with bailiffs and police.The final cost of the eviction was nearly £7million, with Basildon Council picking up a bill for £4.3million whilst Essex Police spent £2.4m on their involvement.The embittered authority sent invoices to the travellers, demanding payments to cover the costs of the operation.The average bill was about £60,000 - although the highest demand was £350,000 - but not a single penny has been paid.
