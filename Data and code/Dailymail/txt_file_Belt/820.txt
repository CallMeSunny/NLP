   Joshua, who fights Raphael Zumbano Love in his 12th professional bout in Birmingham on Saturday, said: 'I think Fury will vacate the British title. Or, if there's a big fight for him, against a contender like myself, he might take it.'He's undefeated and at the stage where he's probably going to be competing for a world title.'He's stuck between a rock and a hard place. I think he's got that mandatory shot against Klitschko and that's why he'll vacate the British belt, because he's got bigger opportunities.'Joshua, 25, has won all of his 11 professional fights so far inside the distance and aims to make it 12 against Love on Saturday.He then fights again just three weeks later when he steps up in class against American 'gatekeeper' Kevin Johnson in a bout which may give pundits an insight into his world title credentials.              Joshua believes future fights against Deontay Wilder (left) and Tyson Fury (right) are inevitable The humble Watford fighter hopes to come through that and eventually clash with Fury for the 'richest prize in sport'.'It would be amazing to fight him for the world title, especially if it was in the UK, rather than having to go abroad and fight the likes of Klitschko,' Joshua said.'Deontay Wilder (WBC champion) would be good for me because it's in America, the Mecca of boxing.'If Fury was to win against Klitschko it would be great for boxing and for me to fight him for a world title would obviously be bigger than fighting for the British.'It would be huge. Heavyweight boxing is different, it's a league of its own and creates that interest.'If he's got the world title belt it's good because there's lots of young talent he can face which will create interest in the division. We're in a good place in the heavyweights in this country.'
