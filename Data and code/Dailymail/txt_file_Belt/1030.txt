         e-mail          94 View  comments    She's already got over twenty years of partying under her belt, but that didn't stop Kate Moss going hard for her 40th birthday.The model stumbled home around 1.30am, wearing sunglasses to hide her eyes, while her blonde hair looked a little dishevelled.Leaning onto a car for support as she made her way into her Primrose Hill home, it clearly was a good night for Kate.Scroll down for video        Hold steady! Kate Moss wears her sunglasses to hide her tired eyes after partying hard for her 40th birthday                      Glam rocker: The model wore her trademark leopard print coat to enjoy her birthday on Thursday night        Fun night: The model was joined by a host of famous faces including Nick Grimshaw, Naomi Campbell and Stella McCartney Quaffing champagne, vodka and cocktails with friends at the exclusive 34 restaurant in Mayfair, Kate was heard to insist: ‘I might be 40 but I still know how to party.’Her group, who included Naomi Campbell, Stella McCartney, Jo Wood and Sadie Frost screeched with high-pitched laughter as they downed champagne, Bellinis, mojitos, Moscow mules, vodka and wine – including Chateauneuf-du-Pape and Sancerre costing up to £70 a bottle.        Where's Jamie? Kate's husband didn't seem to be around to help his wife into their home                      Can't hide: Even with the sunglasses on it was clear to see Kate Moss had really gone in for her birthday          So many gifts: The model's presents were carried out by hotel staff after her party    With other guests, among  them fashion designer John Galliano, photographer Mario Testino, hairdresser James Brown, Shanghai Tang founder Sir David Tang and Radio 1 Breakfast Show host Nick Grimshaw, they ran  up a bill believed to have been around £5,000. Onlookers said they ordered very little food, only starters and a few nibbles, in two and a quarter hours at the restaurant.          Where's the party? Oh yes, I'm already at it! Kate totters out of her bash            The party's over! After a very long lunch Kate leaves the 34 Restaurant                      Steady as she goes! Kate looked as if she'd had a little too much party on her birthday          Holding on! Kate gets a helping hand as she leaves the restaurantThat might explain why Kate looked ever-so-slightly the worse for wear – and even a little wobbly on her feet – as she left at 6.30pm.The supermodel, who wore her trademark leopard print coat, high-heeled black brogues and carried a powder pink Chanel handbag, looked less polished than when she had arrived from her Highgate home at 4.15pm with husband Jamie Hince, singer and guitarist with rock band The Kills.Indeed, onlookers were struck not only by her unsteadiness on her feet but also by the fact that her short black dress did nothing to disguise the effects of ageing on her somewhat knobbly knees.Kate was overheard to say she was thinking about going to the Playboy Club.        Supermodel exit! Naomi Campbell left the restaurant dressed entirely in black                    '70s style: Naomi wore a furry jacket with flared trousers for the birthday party       Sunglasses are the one: Many of the guests wore shades as they left the party                        Black is the new 40? Like Naomi, Sadie Frost (left) and Stella McCartney (right) were dressed in darker shades        He'll need it: Nick Grimshaw carried a bottle of water as he headed home after Kate's birthday at The Dorchester    However, she and her party – which also included her mother Linda Rosina and the billionaire retail tycoon Sir Philip Green – are believed to have made their way straight on to the Dorchester Hotel in Park Lane, where China Tang is among her favourite restaurants.It remained to be seen last night whether they would have the stamina to match the infamous antics of some of Kate’s  previous birthday parties.For her 30th, she hosted a The Beautiful And The Damned party, based on the F Scott Fitzgerald novel, which was reported to have included an orgy. Three years later she indulged in a riotous 24-hour drinking and dancing party.        Early start: Nick had to be at the BBC Radio 1 studios early Friday morning, but he seemed to be full of energy despite the late night                        More celebrity guests: Topshop's Sir Philip Green (left) and former model Jo Wood (right)        Where's Tamara? Bernie Ecclestone and son-in-law Jay Rutland were spotted at The Dorchester too   Her birthday bashes seemed, until last night, to have run out of steam a little since then.When she turned 34, she planned four parties spanning 34 hours, one hour for each year of her life, only to decide to call it a day after a mere 18 hours.Last year Kate, who has an 11-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, celebrated with a low-key trip with family to her local pub. The year before she marked her 38th birthday with two relatively sedate meals attended by her nearest and dearest.           It had seemed she might be taking her own words about acting her age to heart. Kate said in an interview that she admired women like Catherine Deneuve, who has ‘such class’ and with whom she recently posed for Vanity Fair magazine.She said of the celebrated 70-year-old French film star: ‘She’s amazing, beautiful and chic and everything I want to be, also as a woman growing old gracefully and with such class.’Kate's big day began early as celebrity well-wishers sent gifts to her North London home throughout the day.          This is 40! Kate was seen celebrating her 40th birthday alongside husband Jamie Hince at 34 Restaurant in London on Thursday        The queen of the catwalk: Kate celebrated her birthday with her nearest and darest                    For the model who has everything: A classic Porsche was reported to be one the gifts Kate received, or even gave herself on her 40th            Party on! Kate left the Dorchester Hotel in London to head to her birthday lunch

Steal Kate's supermodel style in a leopard print coat



Vintage leopard print coat
A Mossy favourite!



Kate Moss is 40 today! Happy birthday to the world's best loved supermodel.
She's come a long way since her days as a Croydon teenager and her early shoots for The Face. And despite most models' careers being over at 30, Mossy is still going strong with campaigns for Eleven Paris, Stuart Weitzman, Kerastase and Rimmel in the last six months alone, not forgetting cover shoots for Vogue (British and Japanese) and of course her iconic story for Playboy. There's no stopping her and that's just the way we like it.
For 26 years now Kate Moss has been inspiring devoted followers worldwide, with not only her modelling career but her innate sense of style too. She is the fashion icon to end all fashion icons and we love her. And one of the reasons why we do is that she's not afraid to be seen in the same thing more than once.
Kate has worn this vintage leopard print coat on countless occasions and it's clearly one of her favourites. It's just got Mossy written all over it. Buying vintage faux fur is a good way to go so check out your local charity shops to go for authentic Moss style.
Or a similar coat is just a click away. Take a look at the furry leopard print cover ups we've found on the high street below. Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and River Island are all over this classic trend and soon you can be too. So wish Kate a happy birthday by paying homage to her style!
