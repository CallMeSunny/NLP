 When Xixi was brutally killed on August 19 last year Matthews claimed he and his girlfriend of 16 months had just had a 'bicker' and called 999 to say she was struggling to breathe.But when paramedics arrived her body was so battered and bruised one medic thought she was already dead. She died in hospital the next day.His victim, who bankrolled his lifestyle and trips across Europe,  called her a 'worthless piece of s**t' and would tell her he would hit her if she did not perform sex acts on him.Mrs Justice Davies outlined the abusive relationship between Matthews and Miss Bi from when they met in April 2015.She said: 'Xixi Bi was a generous and loving young woman.'When you met Xixi you were unemployed. She was the daughter of wealthy parents living in China.'She came to the UK for her education ... Xixi provided you with a home, clothing, she bought a car for you. You took what she gave.'            Anger: Matthews has been labelled 'selfish, mindless and gutless' by Miss Bi's family today         Miss Bi's studies started to suffer after she began a relationship with Matthews (pictured together), and he lived off her money and enjoyed trips across EuropeMatthews, 24, called the 999 operator 'darling' as he explained he had been 'really, really horrible' to his diminutive girlfriend - in fact he had rained dozens of blows on her, causing 'massive bruising' and multiple fractures.His trial heard she went into cardiac arrest at 8.30am on August 19 last year because of complications from her multiple injuries. After his arrest denied murdering Miss Bi, 24, but pleaded guilty to manslaughter, insisting he had not meant to kill her.         Matthews' texts to his girlfriend revealed he called her a 'worthless piece of s**t' and would beat her around the headBut on Friday a jury found him guilty of murder after a 10-day trial at Cardiff Crown Court. Born in China, Miss Bi was educated in the UK from the age of 15 and was a post-graduate student at Cardiff Metropolitan University at the time of her death. Matthews has been labelled 'selfish, mindless and gutless' by Miss Bi's family today, who described her as an 'intelligent and energetic person who had a very bright future and her whole life in front of her'.In a statement released by South Wales Police, they said she was a much-loved daughter, granddaughter, sister and friend.'All this was taken away from her, and us, by the selfish, mindless and gutless actions of Jordan Mathews, who brutally killed her for no other reason than jealousy,' they said.'He has wallowed in self-pity and refused to accept the truth.'This has meant that we have had to endure having to hear the events of Xixi's death played out in the public arena of the crown court and the media.'The heart has been ripped out of our family.'The family thanked the police and the prosecution for their work to ensure 'justice has been done'.They added: 'We accept the decision of the court and hope that the sentence imposed upon Jordan Mathews will prevent him ever having the opportunity to hurt anyone else and give him time to reflect on his actions.'Detective chief inspector Gareth Morgan, said Miss Bi 'was enjoying her life living and studying in Cardiff, but that tragically changed when she met Jordan Matthews'.He said Matthews identified her vulnerabilities and manipulated them with his 'controlling and coercive behaviour which escalated into extreme and sustained violence that led to her death'.  She met Matthews in April 2015 on the dating website Plenty of Fish and they moved in together soon after.The couple lived first in her apartment at the Hayes in Cardiff city centre before moving to France together so Miss Bi could improve her language skills.Matthews, who repeated over and over in his police interview how much he had loved his 'amazing girl', said that was the first time he had been abroad.They returned to South Wales after her visa was rejected and moved into the Ely Road flat in the Llandaff area of the city, which the jury heard was not as nice as Miss Bi was used to.During their relationship, Miss Bi lost contact with her ex-boyfriend, lost weight, stopped taking care of her appearance and became 'quiet, withdrawn and submissive', according to friends.Her attendance on her university course dropped and she was forced to resit a year after missing a number of deadlines.The polyglot, who spoke excellent English, French and Spanish, supported Matthews financially, paying for his clothes, food, accommodation and a car.              Evidence: The day before Miss Bi's death, the student (left and right) had travelled to London to visit a friend who spotted bruising on her face. A month before that she suffered a broken jaw         Lies: A transcript of Matthews' (left) police interview was read out to the jury at Cardiff Crown Court in which he said: 'The last thing I would ever do to my beautiful Bi is kill her'Meanwhile, her brother said he saw her she wearing very heavy make-up with what looked like bruises underneath and neighbours reported hearing the sound of arguing coming from their ground-floor flat.She was admitted to hospital the month before her death for surgery on a broken jaw, which she claimed happened when she fell down stairs while wearing heels at home.
