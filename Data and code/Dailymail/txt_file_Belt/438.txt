 However, the message is more serious. Wear your belt or risk death. The video, shot in Taiwan, shows the young woman sleeping with her long legs on the dashboard of the car. She is not wearing a seat belt.It looks as if the driver of the car is filming her, and either fails to notice an obstruction in front forcing him to stop suddenly, or deliberately breaks as a joke.Either way, the unexpectedly sharp stop causes the woman to slide forward on her back, with her backside disappearing into the foot well of the vehicle and her legs and arms flailing above her head.
