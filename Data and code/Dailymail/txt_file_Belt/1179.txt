There are so many jeans trends it can be hard to know where to start.
Long gone are the days when the only style to be seen in was a pair of Levi's 501s... Now we've got to choose from distressed, cropped, boyfriend, flared, mom, skinny, high waist, embellished and the list goes on.
Well add striped jeans to it too as we've spotted Bella Thorne looking pretty fly in this pair from Topshop. We love the vintage mom fit and turn ups and of course the blue on blue pinstripes.
They make a great change from the classic denim washes we're used to so why not give your collection an update in time for summer? They'll look cute with cropped tops and sneakers or add heels and a slinky camisole top for night. 
Click (right) to buy them now or check out the other stripey styles in our edit below.
