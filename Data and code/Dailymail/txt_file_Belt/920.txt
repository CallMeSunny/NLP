The Van Allen radiation belts are donut-shaped rings of so-called 'killer electrons' that encircle our planet.They can often swell dramatically in response to solar storms and other space weather, posing serious dangers to communications and GPS satellites, as well as humans in space.Only two of these belts were known until a third was discovered in 2013, and its origin had remained a mystery until now.Now scientists have discovered the third Van Allen radiation belt is created by a 'space tsunami'.         The Van Allen radiation belts are donut-shaped rings of so-called 'killer electrons' that encircle our planet. They can often swell dramatically in response to solar storms and other space weather, posing serious dangers to communications and GPS satellites, as well as humans in space  THE VAN ALLEN BELTS The Van Allen belts, named after their discoverer, are regions within the magnetosphere where high-energy protons and electrons are trapped by Earth's magnetic field. Known since 1958, these regions were historically classified into two inner and outer belts. However, in 2013, Nasa's Van Allen Probes reported an unexplained third Van Allen belt that had not previously been observed. This third Van Allen belt lasted only a few weeks before it vanished, and its cause remained inexplicable.Earth's magnetic field protects our planet from the harsh battering of the solar wind, and produces the beautiful displays of aurorae in the sky.When the solar wind is most violent, extreme space weather storms can create intense radiation in the Van Allen belts, and drive electrical currents that can damage terrestrial electrical power grids.It was previously believed there were two Van Allen belts, but particle detection instruments aboard twin probes in 2013 revealed the existence of a third, transient radiation belt.The appearance of the third Van Allen belt, one of the first major discoveries of the Van Allen Probes era, had continued to puzzle scientists with ever increasingly complex explanation models being developed.

          On August 31 a giant prominence on the Sun erupted, sending out particles and a shock wave that traveled near Earth. This event may have been one of the causes of the third radiation belt         An artist's impression of the Van Allen belts: The Van Allen radiation belts are donut-shaped rings of so-called 'killer electrons' that encircle our planet, which often swell dramatically in response to space weatherNow a group of scientists at the University of Alberta, Canada, believes it has understood how the third belt is formed.  SATELLITE KILLERS Many of the services we rely on today, such as GPS and satellite-based telecommunications, are affected by radiation within the Van Allen belts.Radiation in the form of high-energy electrons, often called 'satellite killer' electrons because of their threat to satellites, is a high profile focus for the International Living with a Star (ILWS) Program and international cooperation between multiple international space agencies.Recent studies of the impact of a severe space weather storm have estimated that the cost of the overall damage and follow-on impacts on space-based and terrestrial infrastructure could be as large as high as $2 trillion.Low frequency waves of plasma transport the outer part of the radiation belt into the space between the planets, which creates the third wave, the researchers found.'Remarkably, we observed huge plasma waves,' said Professor Ian Mann, physics professor at the University of Alberta and lead author on the study.'Rather like a space tsunami, they slosh the radiation belts around and very rapidly wash away the outer part of the belt, explaining the structure of the enigmatic third radiation belt.''Intense so-called ultra-low frequency (ULF) plasma waves, which are excited on the scale of the whole magnetosphere, transport the outer part of the belt radiation harmlessly into interplanetary space and create the previously unexplained feature of the third belt.'We have discovered a very elegant explanation for the dynamics of the third belt,' said Professor Mann. 'Our results show a remarkable simplicity in belt response once the dominant processes are accurately specified.'Scientists were able to observe the formation of the third belt, which persisted for four weeks before a powerful interplanetary shock wave from the sun annihilated it.         A cutaway model of the radiation belts with the Van Allen probes flying through them: The radiation belts are two donut-shaped regions encircling Earth, containing high-energy particles, mostly electrons and ions         Energetic electron data gathered by the probes: It shows three discrete energy channels. The third belt region and second slot are highlighted, and exist until a coronal mass ejection destroys them on October 1  SPACE RADIATION Politicians are also starting to give serious consideration to the risk from space weather. The White House recently announced the implementation of a Space Weather Action Plan highlighting the importance of space weather research like this recent discovery. The action plan seeks to mitigate the effects of extreme space weather by developing specific actions targeting mitigation and promoting international collaboration. 'After decades of studying the radiation belts, this was a completely new phenomenon,' Harlan Spence of the University of New Hampshire, who was part of the team that operated the probes, said at the time.Understanding the third belt will also help scientists understand space radiation, and reducing the space radiation threat to satellites during other space storms.For the last 50 years, and since the accidental discovery of the Van Allen belts at the beginning of the space age, forecasting this space radiation has become essential to the operation of satellites and human exploration in space.'Space radiation poses a threat to the operation of the satellite infrastructure upon which our twenty-first century technological society relies,' said Professor Mann.'Understanding how such radiation is energized and lost is one of the biggest challenges for space research.'       Danger: The Van Allen belts known to be hazardous to satellites, astronauts and technological systems on Earth, so increasing understanding of them is critical as societies become more reliant on space-based technology
