Huitlacoche is a corn blight that resembles sickly grey tumours. To American and European farmers, it is a filthy smut and disease, something to be eradicated and despised. To Mexicans, though, it’s an expensive delicacy, a fungus that sells for far more than the ear of corn it grows upon.          The chef proprietors of Cobham's Stovell's, Fernando and Kristy Stovell, have culinary pedigree (pictured: braised neck of pork)The taste is mild but pronounced, a mixture of damp earth and umami.The fresh stuff is a common enough sight in and around Mexico City, at its best after the rains end in October. I’ve munched it wedged in quesadillas and draped in melted cheese. Fried up with chorizo, and stuffed into tacos. But outside Mexico, it’s rare. The fresh is impossible to find, leaving those of us with a taste for this fantastic fungus to get by on the tinned. A couple of Mexican restaurants in London might occasionally have it flit through their menus. But it’s not exactly ubiquitous.Which is why it’s such a shock to find it in Chobham, a place more concerned with pony shops and pretty pubs than the wilder shores of regional Mexican cuisine. But it’s huitlacoche sure enough, encased in the most silken of pasta, and topped with poblano curds.          To Mexicans, Huitlacoche is an expensive delicacy, a fungus that sells for far more than the ear of corn it grows upon (pictured: Huitlacoche ravioli, poblano and cheese curds)The grumble of fungus slips easily into the chilli spiked cheese, creating a dish of rather wonderful, modern Mexican aplomb. In London, the dish would be a thrill. In Chobham, it’s a miracle.And it’s far from the only surprise at Stovell’s, a small, heavily beamed and low-ceilinged room a mile or so out of Chobham. At first glance, it seems like yet another Michelin-fixated, commuter belt pub-turned-posh-restaurant, with tasting menus, peculiarly shaped plates and a saucepan of smug. But a brief glance at the menu, and ennui turns to excitement.Red cabbage consommés and roast duck schwarmas, slices of Iberico ham, a charcoal-grilled Chateaubriand for two. Nice. So nice, that I choose, of my own free will, the tasting menu. More to annoy my hung-over friend than for reasons gastronomic. Still, an interesting menu is one thing, decent cooking another. The chef proprietors, Fernando and Kristy Stovell, have culinary pedigree. Fernando is half Mexican, hence the huitlacoche. This could be very interesting indeed.         We leave sated, but not stuffed, filled with the warm glow of an unexpected feast (pictured: butter roasted Cornish cod)It starts with a mutter rather than roar. A lozenge of frozen gin and tonic, made from their own gin. OK, if uninspiring. Just like the next course, crudités, a few pert carrots and radishes, in a terracotta pot with, yup, edible soil. Edible bloody soil. Funny the first time, now plain dull. High time for soil to be thrown on the compost heap of fads long past.At this point, spirits begin to sag. Just like Joe’s appetite, as last night’s excess permeates his soul. Great. A barely conscious lunch companion, and I’m stuck in the excruciatingly eternal spin-cycle of a Home Counties gastronomic ‘journey’. Red cabbage consommé arrives in bowls filled with smoke. My heart sinks further. Soil, then smoke. What am I doing? I could be eating noodles – with chilli, and oil, and lip-numbing pepper.The broth, though bracing, is a little sharp and aggressive, the vinegar bullying a plumply subtle pork-and-apple dumpling into silent submission. I look at my watch, 20 minutes down, two hours to go. Damn you, tyranny of the tasting menu.         Sure, I could do with less soil and more of that Mexican magic. But there’s real talent here. And the service is flawless. Why Stovell’s hasn’t got a Michelin star, I don’t knowA tapioca crisp, like a Quaver with a steroid habit, is served with a plastic bottle of home made hot sauce. Now we’re talking. Followed by that magnificent ravioli stuffed with corn blight. I sit up straight, my taste buds moving from torpor to tremulous glee. And it gets better. Roasted cauliflower barded with lamb fat. With a grating of almond. A dish of simple, sublime and unfettered magnificence, the magic coming from inherent culinary nous, rather than prissy mucking about.  Stovell’s   125 Windsor Rd, Chobham, SurreyGU24 8QS, 01276 858000stovells.com★★★★★  Just like smoked ricotta with trompettes des morts. And fried quail’s egg, atop a fresh-baked pitta. There’s texture and charm and autumnal succour, plus a little grin of lactic delight. By now, I’m beaming and even Joe’s a little brighter. Meaning he utters a word rather than a grunt.Veal comes ‘hot’ and ‘cold’. An immaculate nugget of deep fried brain alongside burnished sweetbread for a double crisp/creamy organ hit. And tongue, transformed into a ragu of astonishing heft and depth, mixed into the thinnest of spaghetti. Sublime.Carpaccio (the ‘cold’ part) is on ice with candied beetroots and jalapeno. It’s bracingly fresh yet slyly rich, Venice via Veracruz.          Then grilled quail with corn, and spanking fresh crab suspended in the most delicate peach jelly. And grilled milk ice cream, a tribute to their friends at Asador Etxebarri in the Basque Country.We leave sated, but not stuffed, filled with the warm glow of an unexpected feast. Sure, I could do with less soil and more of that Mexican magic. But there’s real talent here. And the service is flawless. Why Stovell’s hasn’t got a Michelin star, I don’t know. Odd bunch, those glorified tyre floggers. Because this is a kitchen with boundless imagination, assured technique, deep passion and a true understanding of flavour. Keep an eye on these two. I get the feeling this is just the start.Tasting menu for one, £70. Two-course set lunch: £16.50
