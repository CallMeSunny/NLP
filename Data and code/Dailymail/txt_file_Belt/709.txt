Career: Mark recently denied claims he quit his presenting gig with US television show Extra to start a family with his other half (pictured in May 2018)       Mark previously opened up on how the couple make their long distance love work.  Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, he said: 'Don't listen to the rulebook, the rulebook will say "long distance can't work', there's no way this couple are going to work," it's bulls**t.'At each other's feet every day doesn't work, it depends on the couple, if you love each other you make it work. I wouldn't suggest going months and months without each other, make it work, put it into your schedule, make sure you see each other enough, it keeps the heart fonder.'Speaking of his move stateside, Mark admitted that he does find it difficult being away from his friends and family.'I miss them every day when I'm not with them. It's something I have to think about in the future, how long I want to be away from them for.'         Mark said of their long-distance relationship: 'Don't listen to the rulebook, the rulebook will say "long distance can't work', there's no way this couple are going to work," it's bulls**t' (pictured in January 2019)
