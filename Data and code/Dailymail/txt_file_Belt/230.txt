 Heidi controversially took over the lingerie line from Australian supermodel Elle Macpherson when The Body's contract ended last year and was not renewed.But Heidi had only admiration for Elle when she spoke to Daily Mail Australia at the launch on Monday. 'I was really excited to launch in Australia because it was known in Australia. This is where it all began,' Heidi started out.                Where to look? Heidi looked thrilled as she stood with for the snaps with the four handsome models              Slender: The supermodel cinched the ensemble in at the waist with a black leather belt         Flawless: With perfectly applied makeup, including a smoldering smokey eye, the German supermodel had her blonde locks coiffed in soft waves'Elle had been doing the line for 25 years and I was excited that I was asked to take over the reins and march along with it and I'm excited to do that,' she added.She agreed that she had big shoes to fill since the Australian model did such a good job at creating a popular brand.'Twenty-five years is a huge success story,' Heidi added.         Strike a pose: The statuesque beauty did what she does best and posed for the cameras ahead of the event        No jet lag here! Heidi was bright and perky at the event after touching down in Australia on Saturday 'I don't want to change the heritage of the brand, I think they have been very successful.'I know there is a lot of women that have their favourites and shape already. I don't want to change that, I want to add to that,' she added.  Of the transition from Elle to Heidi, Bendon CEO Justin Davis-Rice said: 'Elle has been a great partner to Bendon, however it's time to take the brand to even greater heights, and Heidi is positioned perfectly to do just that.'

Heidi stood arm-in-arm with the Sports Illustrated modelHeidi also told Daily Mail Australia at the VIP event what her favourite lingerie was and it's no surprise that the natural beauty also likes her underwear to be natural.'I do love a lot of the soft bras, not a lot of the big push up bras. I like it when it's a little more soft and a little bit more of a natural shape.'I love it when it's flirty, I love when there's a lot of lace. I do love colour too,' she explained.But for the mum-of-four, choosing intimates is all about her mood. 'It really depends on my mood. Sometimes you feel more girly… sometimes sexy. That's probably more black and garter belts,' she laughed.While Heidi says her range will also cater to women of all sizes because she thinks that have been 'neglected' in the past.
