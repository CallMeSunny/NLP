Search continues for lost Qld police gun By Australian Associated Press   Published: 21:34 BST, 25 June 2015  |  Updated: 21:34 BST, 25 June 2015                e-mail         The desperate search for a lost police handgun is approaching its third day.The loaded semi-automatic Glock pistol was dislodged from a male officer's belt during a foot chase at Woodridge, south of Brisbane, on Wednesday afternoon.The policeman and his colleagues had attempted to intercept a stolen car using road spikes, forcing him to momentarily draw the gun but place it back in the holster for the chase.Queensland's police commissioner Ian Stewart has warned of potentially deadly consequences if the weapon ends up in the wrong hands.Even a child could have the strength to fire the gun, Queensland Police Union president Ian Leavers said on Thursday."I just hope that if it has been found, it is certainly handed in because these things in the hands of the wrong people certainly can be problematic. We're all aware of that."The shocked officer was "doing it tough", Mr Leavers said.
