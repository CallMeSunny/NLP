Stuart Hall admits his world-title fight with fellow Brit Lee Haskins represents his final chance to regain the IBF bantamweight belt he surrendered in 2014.The 36-year-old's bout with Bristolian Haskins, a repeat of the contest which Hall lost on points four years ago, is on the undercard of Kell Brook's fight with the fearsome Gennady Golovkin at London's O2 Arena.Hall wants to end the night as one of 14 British world champions by taking Haskins' IBF bantamweight title off him and he questioned whether a man four years his junior - nicknamed 'Playboy' - is worthy of such an illustrious title.

This fight means absolutely everything to me and no way am I letting that "Playboy" get in the way of my dreams.'Haskins is a frail little girl. He's not going to put a dent in me. I'm going to steam through him and quick. I can't wait to see his face when he's on the floor.'He was giving it the big one saying he is going to knock me out in six rounds, is he having a laugh? All Lee will do is run and be on the back foot, but I'll go hunting for him and I will knock him clean out.'Haskins isn't world-level and I'll prove it. He's got lucky throughout his career, he is British-level at best. Lee was handed that world title. Yes, he trained, yes, he made weight but that wouldn't sit right with me, I would want to have earned it.'He was parading it round like he's gone out there and dethroned the champion but he didn't and he would have got spanked by (Randy) Caballero if the fight took place.'There could be another British world champion by the end of the evening too as Charlie Edwards aims to defeat Johnriel Casimero in the flyweight division.          Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn (centre) poses with Hall (left) and Charlie Edwards (right)
