A mini Love Island reunion happened earlier this week when some of our favourite villa faces attending Boohoo's Christmas bash at the Hilton Deansgate in Manchester. 
Gabby Allen, Ellie Brown, Alexandra Cane and Kendall Rae Knight were all in attendance and, unsurprisingly, they were all decked out in Boohoo.
While Kendall opted for a one-shoulder jumpsuit and Alexandra reached for embellishment, Gabby channeled Clueless vibes in this houndstooth dress, teamed with over-the-knee boots and a snake print beret.
