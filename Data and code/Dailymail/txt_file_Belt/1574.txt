 It is said that Wu's father and late mother are both migrant workers and the boy has been raised by his grandparents who are relaxed on his education in their hometown of Sihushan.Speaking to his uncle in a police station after being arrested, the sixth-grade pupil reportedly showed no remorse towards his action and said 'the person I killed was my mother, not anyone else'.It is reported that the body of the 34-year-old woman was only discovered the next morning when concerned neighbours who found the victim missing called the police. Wu and his two-year-old younger brother allegedly spent the night at home with their mother's corpse.After killing his mother, Wu used her phone to message his teacher - pretending to be her - to take a leave for the next day, reported The Paper. He also lied to his grandfather in a calm manner that 'my mother went out' when the elderly man came to find his daughter the next morning, the same report said. Earlier this week, Wu was released by police without any punishment because he was deemed too young to be penalised by law. At present, the minimum age for one to be charged with a crime in China is 14.He is not old enough to be sent to a juvenile detention centre either. All such facilities in China require their detainees to be at least 14 years of age. Although Wu does not have to bear any consequences for his behaviour, life for him would never be the same.           The child stabbed the 34-year-old woman with a kitchen knife and spent the night with her corpse with his two-year-old younger brother at their home (pictured) in Hunan province The child has been sent back to his father to be looked after, but his father, a migrant worker, told Chinese media that the family were facing great difficulties taking care of the child.Wu's father told reporters that the child's school refused to take him back due to the protest from other parents, who fear that Wu could harm their children, reported The Cover.The article said the education authorities suggested Wu's family choose a different school for him. However after the news spread out on social media, Chinese web users, already shocked by Wu's criminal act, say they would not let any child like Wu to be near their sons and daughters - potentially leaving Wu to have no school to go to at all. It's not just Wu's education that his family worry about. The family of five - Wu, Wu's father, brother and grandparents - have had to live out of a hotel room after the child was released because their neighbours were furious with Wu, said The Cover. One of their neighbours, who saw the crime scene, told BJ News that the community did not welcome Wu and his family to live there any longer.           Wu and his family have had to live in a hotel room (pictured) after he was released by police. BJ News reported that their neighbours were enraged by the case and did not want them backThe authorities' decision of releasing Wu back home, free of consequences, has sparked heated debates among the Chinese public, with many people urging the government to revise the current legal system to better handle juvenile crime cases.  In a commentary, state-run gmw.cn urged Chinese authorities to lower the minimum age of a person who could be charged with a crime. The article said: 'Perhaps, someone people would think the leniency of law would make underage people feel grateful and correct their own mistakes; but the reality could be different.' Experts have also demanded the government find better solutions to educate and rehabilitate juvenile delinquents. Chinese news outlet Caixin said according to law Wu should be sent for 're-education through custody', which is a vague term. Pi Yijun, a specialist in juvenile delinquency at the China University of Political Science and Law, told Caixin that there were few institutional provisions for such rehabilitation. 'That's why in a large number of cases, the police have no alternative but to return these underage children to society,' Pi said.Wu's father is hoping the local government to step in and help him find a way to guide his son and bring his life back to normal.  BJ News reported that the Sihushan government had already drafted a plan to deal with Wu's future life and education, but a government spokesperson said they could not reveal the details out of protection for Wu.
