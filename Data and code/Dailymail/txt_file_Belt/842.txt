Anthony Crolla finally claims world title after Darleys Perez knockout By Press Association   Published: 14:24 BST, 22 November 2015  |  Updated: 14:25 BST, 22 November 2015                e-mail         Anthony Crolla knocked out Darleys Perez to become WBA world lightweight champion in Manchester.Crolla was denied a world belt in July when his first clash with Perez was declared a draw - the decision robbing the Manchester fighter an emotional win in the wake of him sustaining serious injuries while trying to detain a burglar earlier in the year.However, it was a different story at the Manchester Arena on Saturday night, as a bodyshot proved the Colombian's undoing with 30 seconds of the fifth round remaining.        Anthony Crolla celebrates his victory There was little to separate the two fighters until Crolla's magical moment - with the punishing left taking the wind out of Perez's sails.The Colombian fell to the floor and failed to beat the count, sparking wild scenes among the home support.Crolla, 29, told Sky Sports 1 afterwards: "It's been an absolute roller-coaster the last 12 months and this is the perfect finish. It's a dream come true."I thought it would be a head shot (that won the fight) but I'll take that bodyshot any day of the week."I remember sinking the left in downstairs and, like most people who land a good bodyshot, I knew it was over there and then."Manchester United fan Crolla added: "I've got to thank the team around me, I'm just so thankful to have this shot and take it. I want more nights like this.""I've been coming here since I was 10 watching Prince Naseem Hamed, Ricky Hatton. There's nowhere else I'd rather do it."Asked about a potential fight next year with WBO lightweight champion Terry Flanagan, a fellow Mancunian, Crolla added: "I wouldn't have a problem with it and I'm sure he wouldn't."We've got a lot of respect for each other. It would be a great night for Manchester."Trainer Joe Gallagher added: "He's had his ups and downs and we had to grab the opportunity with both hands."We needed the nasty Anthony Crolla and we saw it tonight. Hopefully we might see him fight at Old Trafford."Promoter Eddie Hearn added: "I'm not sure you can find a nicer man in the world. The worry was whether he could grab the opportunity."Everyone was praying he would do it tonight and Manchester and Britain should be proud of him."
