I was nothing but learning from her at the start and she was a natural mum.'He then confessed: 'I do get a bit over-excited sometimes. I'll go home and she'll say, "What did you say that for?" But I'm just really happy with everything and life's great. 'I'm really enjoying myself and everything's really good, so I can't really complain. I just like to talk about it!' Liam and Cheryl had welcomed Bear into the world back in March, after the former Girls Aloud star had kept notoriously private about her pregnancy.               Sweet: Liam and Cheryl had welcomed Bear into the world back in March and the One Direction star has praised his love, branding her 'superwoman' when it comes to her embracing motherhood         Oops: He then confessed that he is often subject to a telling off from his popstar love for publicly revealing too much about their personal lifeIntroducing her son on Instagram days after his birth, Cheryl penned: 'On Wednesday 22nd March Liam and I became parents to an incredibly beautiful, healthy baby boy, weighing 7lb 9 and looking like a dream. Although he still doesn't have a name he is already stealing hearts.'She continued: 'We are all madly in love and overwhelmingly happy with our little arrival. Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers around the world. A day that now has a different meaning to me forever.'Liam, meanwhile, had gushed: 'My close friends and family know there are very few times when I'm left speechless... wow!'I'm incredibly happy to welcome our new baby boy into the world, it's a moment that I will never forget for the rest of my life and my favourite memory I have so far.'         Introducing their son: Cheryl and Liam both took to Instagram with a sweet photo of the One Direction star cradling baby Bear in his arms just days after his birthReferring to Cheryl, he added: 'I'm completely in awe of his incredible mother and how she has been the whole way through this, she's really made my dreams come true... he's already capturing hearts including mine. I feel very blessed.'Since then, the duo have decided against sharing photos of Bear to social media, with Liam occasionally toying fans by posting the odd photo of himself and his mini-me - taking extra care to conceal his face. As well as an adorable shot of himself and Bear sporting matching trainers, Liam recently shared another of his son's teeny hand clutching onto his as he marked turning 24, his first birthday as a father, and gushed: 'Best birthday ever'. Meanwhile, Liam has previously discussed previously his trials and tribulations as a new father and discussing nappy changing duties, he laughed: 'I'm good at the hand block – you gotta be like a ninja.

The way he looks at you says it all.''Your relationship melts my heart,' she confessed. 'You are the centre of his world & We adore you.'

I got back to school the next day and when my friends saw it they were literally ripping the p*** out of me.'However, he did joke: 'Now they can't say it didn't work. The wink is powerful, it has powers beyond its own means. I have to be careful — it's a licensed weapon in the UK.'In the same interview with the paper, Liam admitted that early on into his romance with Cheryl she had tried to cool things off with him. They have now been together for over a year and a half.          History: The pair famously met when Liam auditioned on The X Factor in 2008 - while Cheryl was a judge and he was just 14 years of age              Cheeky: Liam had infamously winked at the Fight For This Love hit-maker during his X Factor audition and he admits he is still mocked now by his friends for doing so
