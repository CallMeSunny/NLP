And so we went that direction a little more. So it’s my version of her!' In November, The Devil Wears Prada star opened up to In Style magazine about dealing with a stutter herself.'I think whatever you have to overcome in life ultimately paves the way [for whom you become as an adult],' she said. 'I got teased a lot, and to this day, I hate unkindness in people and bullies.'          New venture: Emily explained that following in Julie Andrews' footsteps was a daunting but exciting prospect (Pictured in The Girl On The Train, 2016)
