 The UFC 223 main event of Khabib Nurmagomedov vs. Max Holloway will be for the lightweight championship. Nurmagomedov was originally scheduled to fight Tony Ferguson. Holloway already holds the 145-pound featherweight belt, and moved up to 155 pounds on less than one week's notice.Ferguson had been the 155-pound interim champion in McGregor's absence and remained the No 1 contender in the division.         McGregpr's last boxing match was in August 2017 when he lost to Floyd Mayweather Jr (Pictured together, August 2017)                McGregor said that earlier this year that he offered to fight Frankie Edgar at UFC 222 in March but the UFC declined (Pictured, Mayweather and McGregor fight, August 2017)         Ferguson had been the 155-pound interim champion in McGregor's absence and remained the No 1 contender in the division (Pictured, McGregor and White, July 2016)         White also announced at the press conference (pictured) that interim champion Tony Ferguson would not be losing his belt        'We're not stripping Tony Ferguson,' White said. 'Tony Ferguson isn't being stripped. The only one that's losing a belt here is Conor. Conor is losing the belt. These two are fighting for the belt.'Once the fight starts, McGregor will no longer be champion and the need for the interim belt will go away - leaving the winner as the true 155-pound champ.Ferguson and Nurmagomedov had been booked to fight each other four times, yet all four fights have been called off.White was hesitant to book a fifth fight between the two but could be forced to should Nurmagomedov walk out the champ.'It's the last fight on earth that I want to make again,' White said. 'However this thing plays out on Saturday, we'll go from there. Tony is still the No. 1 ranked guy in the world either way, no matter who wins. I'll deal with that when it's time to deal with it.'UFC 223 will be held at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on April 7.
