Just like humans seek shade from the sun, microbes that formed Earth's first ecosystems looked for shelter from harsh solar rays.This is according to a discovery of fossilised microbes that lived more than three billion years ago at a time called the Archaean aeon.During the Archean, the Earth's crust and layers had just formed and had begun to cool, although the sun's rays were much harsher than they are today.         Just like humans seek shade from the sun, microbes that formed Earth's first ecosystems looked for shelter from harsh solar rays. This is according to a discovery of fossilised microbes that lived more than three billion years ago at a time called the Archaean aeonScientists believe these ancient life forms avoided the sun's UV radiation by hiding in tidal sediment, formed by air bubbles.The discovery was made at the Barberton greenstone belt in South Africa, where there are layers of rock thought to be 3.22 billion-years-old.The rock studied was recently pushed to the surface by volcanic activity.

 It contained something known as 'microbial mats', which are sheets of microbes that covered tidal areas of the shore, according to a report in New Scientist.Ancient rod-shaped fossilised microbes were found underneath one of these microbial mats by a team of researchers from Germany and Switzerland.         Scientists believe these ancient life forms avoided the sun's UV radiation by hiding in tidal sediment, formed by air bubbles.

DID LIFE FIRST EMERGE FROM POISON?    Life on Earth may have been started by a series of chemical reactions triggered by two simple but poisonous compounds that were plentiful on our planet four billion years ago.Chemists from the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge claim they may have finally solved the riddle of how life first got going on Earth.They have found it is possible to create the three main molecular building blocks of life - DNA, proteins and lipids - from hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light.Their findings suggest that the basic components for biological cells could have all occurred simultaneously in primordial ponds and streams, coming together to form the first cells.This suggests that life may well have first emerged here on Earth - out of a toxic soup of poisonous gas - rather than being carried to our planet by a comet or meteorite from outer space.But the researchers behind the new study say that meteorite impacts probably still played a key role in giving life a first leg up on the ladder towards existence.They claim that meteorite impacts around four billion years ago - known as the Late Heavy Bombardment - could have carried with them carbon rich material that reacted with nitrogen in the air to produce an abundance of hydrogen cyanide.This poisonous gas could then have dissolved in water and undergone a series of chemical reactions, along with hydrogen sulphide, driven by ultraviolet light/
