 'Please PLEASE PLEASE be careful out there tonight, always be with someone and if you have no dire reason to be out of the building, I would recommend staying indoors if you’re alone.'Other students also took note and posted their own warnings on social media telling their room mates to keep safe.But shortly afterwards, Gill sent around another email on Facebook confirming that the man who was spotted was in fact a priest and not a KKK member.         Students had been issued with a warning from a residential officer warning them of a KKK member on campus. Pictured are actual members of the Ku Klux Klan (file picture) According to Breitbart News, he added: 'So what happened tonight goes like this: a person saw white robes and what looked to them like a weapon, got scared (rightfully so), warned people, warned staff, which in turn caused me to warn my residents because I need to look out for my residents, which in turn made it spread.'Then my residents, terrified, come running to me, saying yeah the report must be true, they saw him and couldn‘t believe there was a klansmember [sic] with a whip. And I see this picture. It’s a priest. With a rosary.'It is believed that the man mistaken for the KKK member was a Dominican friar, who had been leading a discussion on the university's campus.Dominican friars typically wear a tunic, a white capuce, which looks like a hood, a leather belt and a long string of Rosary beads.
