Quasicrystals are said to have 'impossible symmetries' and are some of the rarest naturally occurring structures on Earth; only two have ever been discovered.Now, researchers have uncovered the key to their mysterious origins.In a series of experiments, a Caltech-led team has demonstrated that natural quasicrystals may form as a result of collisions between objects of unusual chemical composition in the asteroid belt.

Quasicrystals defy the symmetrical rules that define crystals – they are ordered, but are not periodic.Researchers discovered the first naturally formed quasicrystals in the early 2000s, after years of manufacturing artificial samples.Princeton physicist Paul Steinhardt and colleague Luca Bindi, then from the Museum of Natural History at the University of Florence, found a grain of an aluminium, copper, and iron mineral with five-fold symmetry.In 2015, Steinhardt and his team found a second quasicrystal.The two grains both came from a sample of the Khatyrka meteorite, pieces of which were found in Russia's Koryak Mountains, and microscopic analysis revealed it had experienced a major shock before hitting Earth.This was likely a high-energy collision with another object.

 The new study led by Paul Asimow, a professor of geology and geochemistry at the California Institute of Technology, hypothesized that energy from an extreme shock to an asteroid could have caused a quasicrystal to form.The 'impossible' structure would be created through a cycle of compression, heating, decompression, and cooling.              Researchers have discovered two quasicrystals in nature, both from a meteorite in Russia. On the left, the top panel shows the symmetry of the first, called icosahedrite. The lower panel shows the symmetry of the quasicrystal found in 2015. On right, the ordered yet non-standard pattern of the quasicrystal is shown, revealed by an electron beam WHAT MAKES QUASICRYSTALS DIFFERENT?    A standard crystal's geometric structure is ordered and periodic.It repeats itself over and over, and can be organized among four types of rotational symmetry: two-fold, three-fold, four-fold, or six-fold.This indicates the number of times an object will look the same within a 360-degree rotation about an axis.An object with two-fold symmetry, for example, will appear the same twice, or every 180 degrees. Quasicrystals defy the symmetrical rules that define crystals – they are ordered, but are not periodic.On the outside, quasicrystals are solid minerals that look like normal, but it is their inner structure that fascinates scientists.Instead of the regularly repeating clusters of atoms seen in most crystals, quasicrystals contain a more subtle and intricate atomic arrangement involving two or more repeating clusters.As a result, a quasicrystal's atoms can be arranged in ways that are not commonly found in crystals, such as the shape of a 20-sided icosahedron with the symmetry of a soccer ball.The difference between crystals and quasicrystals can be visualized by imagining a tiled floor: Tiles that are six-sided hexagons can fit neatly against each other to cover the entire floor.But five-sided pentagons or 10-sided decagons laid next to each will result in gaps between tiles.  To test this, Asimow simulated the collision between two asteroids.He took thin slices of minerals from the meteorite – including metallic copper-aluminium alloy found in nature only in the Khatyrka meteorite – and sandwiched them in a puck-like case.This was then screwed to the muzzle of a four-meter-long, 20mm-bore single-stage propellant gun.The researcher blasted the puck with a projectile at nearly one kilometer per second, roughly the speed of the fastest rifle-fired bullets.Then, they sawed open the sample and polished it.         The two grains both came from a sample of the Khatyrka meteorite, pictured, pieces of which were found in Russia's Koryak Mountains, and microscopic analysis revealed it had experienced a major shock before hitting EarthIn several spots, they found, the impact had smashed the elements together and created microscopic quasicrystals.According to the researchers, this suggests these types of shocks are responsible for the formation of natural quasicrystals.'We know that the Khatyrka meteorite was shocked,' Asimow said. 'And now we know that when you shock the starting materials that were available in that meteorite, you get a quasicrystal.'As the work continues, the researcher will test different combinations of minerals to determine the necessary components for a quasicrystal to form naturally.
