Jesy told Now magazine this week: 'I feel that as I’m getting older I’m becoming a little recluse. I love the girls to pieces but because I’m the older one in the group I just feel like I’m turning into an old woman. I love peace and quiet.'The brunette has had to duck out of recent concerts, including a gig in Singapore because she tore a ligament during a vigorous dance routine at the Malaysian capital.In March, the group had to cancel two shows in Belfast, which were later rescheduled, after Jesy came down with a mysterious illness.                 Stage stars: Perrie and her Little Mix bandmates (from left) Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall have just returned to the UK from the Get Weird tour
