A braver American came. An idolised Englishman still sent him the same way as the paper champion who came to these shores and went home without his world heavyweight title.Anthony Joshua’s first defence of that IBF belt set the pulses racing faster. Dominic Breazeale lasted three times longer than Charles Martin in this same ring at London’s O2 Arena 11 weeks earlier but the end was just as inevitable.It came at the start of the seventh round following some brutal punishment. Great credit goes to the taller man from California for restoring the image of the brave American boxer which Martin had tarnished.          Anthony Joshua (pictured on Saturday night) knocked out Dominic Breazeale in seven at London's O2 Arena         Joshua pictured punching Breazeale on another successful night for the heavyweight champion          Joshua’s first defence of that IBF belt lasted longer than the night he won it as he saw off Breazeale in seven         Joshua continued his march towards more heavyweight glamour clashes by beating Breazeale on Saturday night         Joshua and Breazeale squared up in the ring at London's O2 Arena on Saturday night before the former beat the latter in sevenBut even greater expectation falls now on Joshua’s shoulders. He has carefully avoided calling out his rival heavyweight champions until now but after this he sent an invitation to yet another American, WBC title holder Deontay Wilder, and his fellow British champion Tyson Fury.He may have to wait — Fury’s rematch with Wladimir Klitschko is delayed and Wilder has another imminent engagement — but clearly he believes he is ready.          more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  Lampard and squad celebrate after securing place in play-off final       Watch video  Derby celebrate Leeds victory with wild dressing room scenes       Watch video  David Beckham reveals secret to Sir Alex Ferguson's football success       Watch video  Marcelo Bielsa reflects on play-off defeat to Derby           Watch video  John Daly uses a golf cart to get between holes at Bethpage Black       Watch video  Theresa May insists Conservatives are the real Brexit Party       Watch video  Two window washers trapped on a swinging lift on top of Oklahoma tower       Watch video  Shaman Durek explains his teachings and philosophy           Watch video  Greens candidate clashes with anti-marriage equality campaigners       Watch video  James Charles stays quiet at LAX amid YouTube drama       Watch video  Adorable goat learns to ride on his pony best friend’s back       Watch video  Motorist runs over a police officer after she pulled him over

   Joshua was dominant from the start behind a shuddering a left jab, threatening devastation with heavy right crosses and uppercuts.Breazeale withstood a ton of punishment before a straight left and huge right sent him down in that seventh. The ensuing storm blew him away.The first world heavyweight title fight since the death of Muhammad Ali was preceded by a tolling of the 10 count on the ring bell. That was followed by a minute’s remembrance within ear-shot of the splendid Ali exhibition, I Am The Greatest, which is housed in another quadrant of the O2 complex. Joshua had been trying to convince himself to start with a more considered approach. Well, that lasted the first 10 seconds of the first round. The big right was uncorked after that and, although Breazeale punched back, some AJ combinations soon followed.           more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  Lampard and squad celebrate after securing place in play-off final       Watch video  Derby celebrate Leeds victory with wild dressing room scenes       Watch video  David Beckham reveals secret to Sir Alex Ferguson's football success       Watch video  Marcelo Bielsa reflects on play-off defeat to Derby           Watch video  John Daly uses a golf cart to get between holes at Bethpage Black       Watch video  Theresa May insists Conservatives are the real Brexit Party       Watch video  Two window washers trapped on a swinging lift on top of Oklahoma tower       Watch video  Shaman Durek explains his teachings and philosophy           Watch video  Greens candidate clashes with anti-marriage equality campaigners       Watch video  James Charles stays quiet at LAX amid YouTube drama       Watch video  Adorable goat learns to ride on his pony best friend’s back       Watch video  Motorist runs over a police officer after she pulled him over

              Joshua pictured in his white robe as he entered London's O2 Arena to face Breazeale         Breazeale lasted seven rounds against Joshua as the heavyweight champion dished out some brutal punishment         Anthony Joshua worked behind his destructive left jab all night, on his way to a first successful defence of his IBF World heavyweight belt         Breazeale's bruised features tell the story of his night of punishment at the destructive, concussive hands of world champion Joshua         Caught between two stools: American Breazeale evades a Joshua right, while having half a mind to unload a clubbing left of his own         Breazeale's legs turn to jelly after an upright, imperious Joshua has delivered his latest hammer blow, but the American refuses to buckle  The second began with some clubbing rights to the Breazeale head, against which he showed commendable resilience. The next barrage sent the American reeling so drunkenly that referee Howard Foster had to look closely to confirm neither hand nor knee had touched. Joshua went for it but Breazeale survived the round.Joshua had more toys in his box and he rained down a variety of punches in the third, behind that stiff jab. Breazeale was taking the big punches better than Joshua expected and Joshua had to take a few himself. As the rounds wore on, the American continued to absorb punishment most bravely, presumably in hope that Joshua, only once before taken beyond the fourth, might tire. He wasn’t given the chance to find out.Joshua went after him ferociously, inflicting the first knock down with a straight right in the seventh followed by a left hook. The end came in a barrage of artillery and a blur of pain. As Breazeale fell like a redwood tree by the ropes, Foster called an end. A braver American had gone the way of Joshua’s preceding 16 professional opponents.           Joshua pictured walking away from Breazeale with his American opponent on the canvas at London's O2 Arena         Breazeale took a lot of punches from Joshua and eventually succumbed in the seventh round in the capitalEarlier in the night, Chris Eubank Jnr successfully defended his British middleweight title, stopping Welsh challenger Tom Doran in four rounds.Eubank, whose last fight ended in shocking cirumstances when opponent Nick Blackwell fell into a coma, showed no sign of losing his attacking instincts as he sent Doran to the canvas once in the third round and twice in the fourth before the contest was waved off. Up next is a likely contest with middleweight world champion Gennady Golovkin.On the same card, George Groves defeated British super-middleweight rival Martin Murray on points, with all three judges scoring it 118-110.           more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  Lampard and squad celebrate after securing place in play-off final       Watch video  Derby celebrate Leeds victory with wild dressing room scenes       Watch video  David Beckham reveals secret to Sir Alex Ferguson's football success       Watch video  Marcelo Bielsa reflects on play-off defeat to Derby           Watch video  John Daly uses a golf cart to get between holes at Bethpage Black       Watch video  Theresa May insists Conservatives are the real Brexit Party       Watch video  Two window washers trapped on a swinging lift on top of Oklahoma tower       Watch video  Shaman Durek explains his teachings and philosophy           Watch video  Greens candidate clashes with anti-marriage equality campaigners       Watch video  James Charles stays quiet at LAX amid YouTube drama       Watch video  Adorable goat learns to ride on his pony best friend’s back       Watch video  Motorist runs over a police officer after she pulled him over
