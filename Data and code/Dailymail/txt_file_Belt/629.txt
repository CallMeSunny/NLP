Liam Smith, the first of the Liverpool family of four fighting brothers to win a world title, successfully defended his WBO junior middleweight belt with a seventh-round stoppage of Jimmy Kelly.In what was predicted to be more a 'gimme' than a voluntary first defence, Smith dominated from the second round. He was methodically breaking down Kelly until the Mancunian's corner waved a white towel as referee Marcus McDonnell intervened.As Kelly weakened he became more desperate. Following warnings for low blows, he had two points deducted in the sixth after a blatant head-butt.

Although he may regret rushing into this world title fight he showed enough grit and sufficient skill to suggest he can come back stronger.Smith will know that the tougher challenges for his title are yet to come.
