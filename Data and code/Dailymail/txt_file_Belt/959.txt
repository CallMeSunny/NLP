Summer in Australia will be either sticker or soggier than usual this year, depending on where you live. In the east, maximum temperatures are expected to drop from January to March, and an above average amount of rain will fall, which will lead to an increase in storms.These are expected to start on January 1, with huge thunderstorms preparing to belt down in Queensland and parts of NSW.           Expect to see more grey skies than usual this year, as storms become more frequent between January and MarchIn the south, minimum temperatures will rise over the next three months, but rainfall will not drop, which will lead to hot and humid nights. Jacob Cronje, a senior meteorologist for Weatherzone, told Daily Mail Australia Western Australia, eastern NSW, and south-east Queensland will all see a cooler, wetter summer than usual. 'We're expecting slightly above average rainfall [for these areas],' he said.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       New Year's revellers will be met with 80mph winds and travel...

 'With this rainfall, and an increase in cloud cover, it looks like the maximum temperature will be cooler than average.'A massive storm is headed towards Brisbane, with the north east of NSW and south east of Queensland expected to see thunderstorms verging on severe. The Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, is also likely to see some rain on the first day of the year.           A massive storm is headed to Brisbane, with the north east of NSW and south east of Queensland expected to see thunderstorms verging on severe       Meteorologist Craig McIntosh said the conditions in Sydney were ripe for a thunderstorm, but he didn't believe there was enough moisture in the air'There's a trough over much of eastern Australia, and those conditions are conducive to thunderstorms, but the chances are highest in Brisbane,' said meteorologist Craig McIntosh.Mr McIntosh said there was a 'low chance' Sydney could see some storms, but the rain would likely avoid the city for the day.'The instability is there but there is maybe not enough moisture,' he explained.  While the rain will be the main issue of the east, a lasting humidity will coat the south of the nation.          In Australia's south, minimum temperatures will rise above average, and combined with a regular amount of rain, create hot, sticky nights         The humidity will be felt in Victoria, Tasmania, and southern parts of South AustraliaMinimum temperatures are set to rise significantly in Victoria, Tasmania, and southern parts of South Australia, but there will still be an average amount of rainfall. Combined, this will lead to humidity, especially at night. Mr Cronje said the increased storms and the increased humidity was because of La Nina conditions in the tropical pacific.'This is one of the big drivers that generally brings increased rainfall over eastern Australia during summer,' he said. Those in the top end will be enjoying summer as usual. Mr Cronje said weather around Darwin will experience warmer days and nights.          For those in Darwin, only sunny skies are ahead, with weather expected to warm up even more over the next few months FORECAST: TUESDAY - THURSDAY    SYDNEY Tuesday - Mostly sunny.
