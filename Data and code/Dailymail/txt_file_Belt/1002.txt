 San Francisco Giants first baseman Brandon Belt is expected to return home Saturday after undergoing an emergency appendectomy Friday night, according to multiple reports. Belt, 30, was pulled from Friday's game in the second inning after not feeling well. He was taken to a nearby hospital in San Francisco, where doctors determined surgery was necessary. His teammates were not aware of the procedure until after the game. "I knew his stomach was bothering him, but I just found out," second baseman Joe Panik said to the Giants' official website. "You just hope for the best, because you never want to see somebody go through something like that." The Giants have not stated how long Belt will be out. He is hitting .307 with a team-high 11 home runs and 31 RBIs. "Hopefully, it's something you can bounce back from sooner rather than later," Panik said. "He's been swinging the bat as well as anyone in the National League. You never want to take that bat out of the lineup or that glove out of the field. Hopefully, he can bounce back quick." Pablo Sandoval replaced Belt at first base. --Field Level Media
