End of the siesta! Cash-strapped Spanish workers forced to abandon the traditional afternoon nap By Kerry Mcdermott   Published: 16:45 BST, 17 July 2012  |  Updated: 16:47 BST, 17 July 2012    


              15 View  comments   For busy office workers across the UK, a 'lunch break' often involves little more than a snatched ten minutes to eat a sandwich at their desk.In contrast, employees in Spain traditionally enjoy two to three hour midday breaks - with time built in for a snooze. But with the country in the grip of its worst economic downturn since the 1930s, it seems the traditional Spanish lunch and siesta could become a thing of the past.

The long hours are in part to allow for a long lunch break, and many Spanish restaurants offer three-course set price menus between 2pm and 5pm to cater for office workers on their breaks.But as more workers opt for shop-bought sandwiches or packed lunches over whiling away the afternoon in restaurants, owners are being forced to rethink their menus and pricing.Margarita Pallas, who works in a small shop on Calle Mallorca in Barcelona, pointed out that bringing lunch to work from home was cheaper than eating in a restaurant.'You save a little every month and that's really good for the family budget now the country is in crisis,' she said.

 Chef Rogelio Barahona, who owns the Urkiola Mendi restaurant in the Spanish capital, said: 'The crisis has hit citizens so hard that people haven't had any choice but to get over the embarassment of taking food to work, and once someone has lost the shame factor, it makes it easy for everyone else.Mr Barahona said sales at restaurants like his own have decreased by as much as 50 per cent during the economic crisis, and many are replacing dishes made on site with pre-prepared meals from bigger kitchens to save money.'I pay my taxes, my suppliers, the rent and in order to pay my staff I haven't earned a salary for the last year,' he said.      With Spain in the grip of its worst economic downturn since the 1930s, traditional long lunches and snoozes are on the wane among office workers (file photo)  Some restaurants are offering cut-price menus using cheaper ingredients to try and lure customers back.Emilia Cordero said she hasn't seen such a sudden change in eating habits since she opened her restaurant La Fuente del Collado in Bustarviejo, outside Madrid, in the 1960s.'I used to sell four or five sirloin steaks in just one weekend, but now, forget about it,' said the restaurant owner, who added that she now sees groups of as many as seven diners splitting a single bottle of wine.'I'll be lucky if I sell one a week, and we've even started offering hamburgers.'School children in Spain, where classes go on until between 4pm and 5pm, still eat a three course meal during their two hour lunch break.But with many state run schools charging as much as 150 euros a month for meals, some struggling parents are opting to send their children to school with packed lunches.
