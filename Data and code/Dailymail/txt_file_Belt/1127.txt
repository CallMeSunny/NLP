 From Tobermory it was taken by road and two ferries to Eigg, taking five hours.Celia Bull, who lives on Eigg, said: ‘The Princess was quite amused the fan belt came off an Astra and was impressed by the resourcefulness of the local people finding a way of getting the pumps to work.‘You cannot cool the engine without the pumps working. It doesn’t matter if it is a £500 boat or a £500,000 boat – you need a fan belt.’         It was fixed with a £20 fan belt from a Vauxhall Astra from Tobermory on the Isle of MullAnne, who is president of the Royal Yachting Association, revealed her experience to Ms Bull at last month’s London Boat Show. Ms Bull said: ‘The fan belt got them back to where they were going.‘Tacking as they did showed that they are skilful sailors.’ The fan belt came from Mackay’s Garage, the only garage in Tobermory. Owner John Mackay, 65, said: ‘We often get yachtsmen wanting fan belts for their engines. The Astra belt must match the pulley size on the boat’s engine.’Anne and Sir Tim keep their 43ft twin-cabin yacht at Ardfern, a remote hamlet in Argyll. Bought in 2012, it is named after a forest on the Balmoral Estate.         A yacht of the same type as Princess Anne
