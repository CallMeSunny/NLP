It was really crazy," she said.Spears' time in Vegas comes to an end in February. In the meantime, she'll also be working on her ninth studio album.The singer, who recently broke up with boyfriend David Lucado, confirmed that the writing process is underway and the album will include lots of "I hate men and I love men" tracks.A release date is yet to be announced.___Online: http://www.intimatebritneyspears.com
