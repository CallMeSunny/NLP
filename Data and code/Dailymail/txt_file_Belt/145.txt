 Police in Beiliu, southern China's Guangxi Province, launched an investigation into the video after it had gone viral on messaging platform WeChat last week. The 15-second footage shows the boy looking back at one point while driving to talk to his mother. His mother then told him 'to drive slowly' and his father told him 'to look ahead'. Beiliu Traffic Police were notified of the clip by web users who contacted them to complain about the parents' behaviour in the video, which they thought was 'ignorant'.Police tracked down the family within two hours after releasing the video to the public via Chinese media in hope of collecting clues, according to an online statement from Beiliu Traffic Police. The father, known by his surname Feng, told the police that the footage was filmed on January 3 last year and was uploaded to a group chat by him a few months ago. According to the man, he and his family were going out on the day and the traffic was light.         Beiliu police found the children's father, Feng (middle), after releasing the video to the publicThe man said initially his wife and his two children were sitting at the back row, but he wanted to let his son experience driving, therefore he took the boy to the front row and put him on his lap.Seeing this, his daughter also wanted to sit at the front row, so the father put her on the passenger seat.  Mr Feng explained to the police that his left hand was on the steering wheel and he was in control of the brake and accelerator throughout the time the boy was behind the wheel.He said he was surprised that the video would become popular online. Mr Feng was given a 'serious oral education' by police officers and ordered to apologise to the public for his behaviour, the police statement said.  China has the highest road deaths involving children in the world. According to figures released by Chinese state media in 2015, more than 18,500 children under the age of 14 are killed by traffic accident every year in the country. WHO: 260,000 people are killed on the road in China every year         Chinese police inspect a damaged truck and cars after the accident in Lanzhou, China, on November 4, which left at least 15 people killed and 44 injuredRoad accidents remain one of the top causes of death and a sensitive social issue in China.Approximately 260,000 people die as a result of traffic accidents in China each year - in comparison to the worldwide figure of 1.25 million people - according to a 2016 report from WHO. The number puts China, the world's most populous nation, in the second place globally after its neighbour India.China has the highest road deaths involving children in the world. According to figures released by Chinese state media in 2015, more than 18,500 children under the age of 14 are killed by traffic accidents every year in the country. A lack of road disciplines, poor road conditions in rural areas, light punishment for violators, polluted air and even bystanders' unwillingness to help out are all potential factors. WHO's figure is about four times the official number released by the Chinese authority, which claimed that 63,000 people were killed on the road in 2016.WHO also points out that of the total estimated road deaths in China, around six out of 10 are vulnerable road users including pedestrians, cyclists and people on motorcycles.
