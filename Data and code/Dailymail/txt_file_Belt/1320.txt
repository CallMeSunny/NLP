Batman Returns: The 42-year-old, pictured with co-star Henry Cavill, confirmed he had sought the advice of his predecessor on playing the Dark Knight                The Batmen coincidentally ran into each other as they were shopping for costumes for their sons - Batman costumes, of course - in Los Angeles last HalloweenAffleck also got a laugh when he revealed how directer Zack Snyder had pitched the character to him: 'He's at the end of his rope, he's older... he's like a burnout.'As for the new suit, Snyder didn't mention if it had any new peeing capabilities, but he did shoot down rumours that the Kryptonite powered armour he can be seen wearing in the trailer made him more powerful. 'It's not really enhancing his strength more than it is protecting him from Superman,' he revealed.              Caught short: When he asked Bale - who played Batman in the previous Christopher Nolan trilogy - if he had any tips, he replied: 'Make sure you can p*ss in that suit'The two men also shed some light on the geography of the film: neither Batman's Gotham City or Superman's Metropolis have ever been given an exact location in the real world, but it's sort of been assumed they are both New York. For the film, they have been made neighbouring cities - similar to the Bay Area in California. The big rule we broke is we put Gotham and Metropolis next to each other,' Snyder confirmed. 'They're sister cities like Oakland and San Francisco.'         Good casting: Affleck also got a laugh when he revealed how directer Zack Snyder had pitched the character to him: 'He's at the end of his rope, he's older... he's like a burnout.'         The good, the bad and the butler: Jeremy Irons, Gal Gadot and Jesse Eisenberg, who play Alfred, Wonder Woman and Lex Luthor respectively, also attended the panel         Bay area: Zack Snyder also revealed he had broken a rule by making Gotham and Metropolis as neighboring cities'There are some really interesting ideas of Metropolis being a big, successful city and Gotham being a place where a lot more downtrodden people live,' Affleck elaborated. 'There’s a ferry people take across who work in Gotham City.'The amazing new trailer appears to confirm that this proximity is partially to blame for the rivalry between the two supposed good guys, as one of Bruce Wayne's buildings - and presumably many of the people that work there - being destroyed as collateral damage in a fight involving Superman.The trailer also showed Gal Gadot in action as Wonder Woman for the first time.'I feel like I have been given this huge opportunity to show the strong, beautiful side of women, finally,' she said during the during the Q&A session in Hall H. 'Wonder Woman has all the strength of a superhero but at the same time, she is very loving and sophisticated and has a lot of emotional intelligence.'          Dawn of Justice: The main cast gathered for group photos in the famous Hall H         Retribution: The trailer reveals that Batman is infuriated after Superman inadvertently destroyed one of Wayne Industries' towers, killing innocent people.         First look: The new trailer shows the sneak peek at Wonder Woman, played by Gadot         Keeping them guessing: Ben shared this snap, captioned, 'We'll see. #regram #rg @batmanvsuperman: Truce? #BatmanvSuperman #SDCC #HenryCavill #BenAffleck #AmyAdams #JesseEisenberg'
