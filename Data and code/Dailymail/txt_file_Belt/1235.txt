    ZLATAN COULD HAVE BEEN SENT OFF: GRAHAM POLL'S VERDICT    Anthony Taylor could have stolen the headlines from a Manchester United win by showing three red cards— for Salomon Rondon, Chris Brunt and, with most impact, Zlatan Ibrahimovic.The Swede battered Craig Dawson with a hefty shoulder charge and he was fortunate that it was seen as aggressive rather than violent by Taylor.Ibrahimovic kept his elbow down which must have helped but given the speed and intensity of the charge, it must have endangered the safety of Dawson, making a red card more appropriate. Taylor was certainly consistent in seeing Chris Brunt's charge into Marcus Rashford late on in the same way, resulting in just a yellow card for the Baggies player.Perhaps the most obvious red card should have come for Rondon.The Venezuelan slapped Marcus Rojo in the face after an altercation in the corner of the pitch. Both players were cautioned and if the cards were issued for their initial acts — meaning Taylor missed the slap — then retrospective action could follow for the West Brom player.  Kids raced round the corner in an attempt to swarm Ibrahimovic for selfies, signatures and the rest. They caught him and he smiled before it appeared for a brief moment that the surge could carry him back inside the stadium. The steward manning that door looked a little shaken. So too were West Brom, the latest side to succumb to someone described by Jose Mourinho as 'Superman'.Ibrahimovic is nothing short of a phenomenon, having starred in more games than any other United player this season. Eleven Premier League goals, 16 in all competitions. Ten in his last nine. Two more at West Brom — either side of a controversial barge on Craig Dawson for which he might have been sent off — makes the Swede even more 'impossible' to drop.He enjoyed the United Christmas bash in London last night and will be afforded some time off from training this week. 'Regeneration' after matches is an Ibrahimovic buzzword with the guidance of personal trainer Dario Fort.'The older I get, the better I get, like red wine! You like red wine?' the striker said. 'I'm a perfect example of that. The older I get, the better I play. I'm settling in. I feel happy, I feel good. Even if I'm 35, in my mind I'm 20. I think I could play also at 50, but it's not down to me.'A black belt in taekwondo, Ibrahimovic relishes martial arts. He also listens to reggae music as a calming technique while pounding the treadmill and puts the hours in with the weights. This form in a United shirt is no accident.         Zlatan Ibrahimovic was only cautioned for an aggressive shoulder charge in the game 'How old is he? 35?' West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster asked. 'Jesus... he's brilliant. He's in great shape. He's a big bloke but he carries himself really well.'You don't do what he's done and won what he's won just by being a big lump. He's got a few more strings to his bow than that.'One of those strings is the example he is setting for Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard and Co. United are more than getting their money's worth and want him to stay for another year.         The Swede is a black belt in taekwondo and listens to reggae music to relax         The 35-year-old has been an integral part of Manchester United's resurgence recently Phil Jones, whose own form has been exceptional over the last month, offered a peek behind the curtain.'He's not big time,' Jones said. 'He's not like that at all. Maybe people see that from the outside, but we don't. He's a great lad off the pitch and he helps the young lads. They look up to him and you see how well he's done.'He looks after his body, he's a true professional. Anyone looking for how a top professional should behave, he's the ideal player.'
