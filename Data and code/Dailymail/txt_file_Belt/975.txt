Huge swathes of the Green Belt may be eaten away as developers as the number of houses planned to be built on the protected land rose by a quarter to 275,000 houses last year.The number of homes to be built comes despite government promises in the Tory election manifesto that the Green Belt was ‘precious’ and ‘paramount’.In its report ‘The Green Belt under siege,’ the Campaign to Protect Rural England said that planning policy is being weakened through loopholes.The report said the 275,000 homes is 50,000 more than 2014, and 200,000 more than in March 2012.         Huge swathes of the Green Belt have been eaten away as developers as the number of houses built on the protected land rose by a quarter to 275,000 houses last yearGreen belt boundaries are also being changed to allow more construction – allowing the fastest rate of growth of new dwellings for two decades.In a step seen as a precedent the Green Belt, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Greg Clark gave the go-ahead to build 1,500 new homes on land designated as Green Belt between Gloucester and Cheltenham.Planning rules normally only allow building on the ribbon of Green Belt land around towns and cities, designed to stop urban sprawl, in ‘very special’ circumstances.But despite conceding the plans would be ‘harmful’ to the Green belt and lead to a ‘loss of the essential characteristic of openness’ he concluded they would bring a ‘substantial benefit’.Other moves that the CPRE said weakens protection of the green belt are proposals in the government’s planning policy consultation to release small sites in the Green Belt for ‘starter homes’.

 Some 11 local authorities have also made changes to the boundaries of the green belt to allow development.Under pressure by the government to set and meet high housing targets, councils are allowing Green Belt to be released for building on through what the CPRE claim is a misuse of an ‘exceptional circumstances’ clause.Three local authorities – Bradford, Durham and Northumberland claim that economic growth justifies allowing ‘exceptional’ change in use of Green Belt land. Green belt land was designated in 1955. The idea was to stop cities sprawling, and to ensure places for recreation around our cities.         The number of homes built comes despite government promises in the Tory election manifesto that the Green Belt was ‘precious’ and ‘paramount’Paul Miner, planning campaign manager at the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), said: ‘Councils are increasingly eroding the Green Belt to meet unrealistic and unsustainable housing targets.‘The Government is proposing to encourage further development in the Green Belt. Our Green Belt is invaluable in preventing urban sprawl and providing the countryside next door for 30 million people.‘We need stronger protection for the Green Belt, not just supportive words and empty promises. To build the affordable homes young people and families need, the Government should empower councils to prioritise the use of brownfield sites. Brownfield land is a self-renewing resource that can provide at least 1 million new homes.’In the run-up to the general election, David Cameron said: ‘Green belt land is extremely precious. Protecting the lungs around our cities is paramount for me.’ A DCLG spokesman said: ‘There are no plans or policy to relax the strong protections that prevent inappropriate development on the Green Belt.‘Ministers have repeatedly been clear that demand for housing alone will not justify changing Green Belt boundaries. Councils are already expected to prioritise development on brownfield sites with 90% of brownfield sites expected to have planning permission by the end of this parliament.‘It means that in 2014-15 just 0.02% of Green Belt was converted to residential use, and the Green Belt is actually 32,000 hectares bigger than it was in 1997.’
