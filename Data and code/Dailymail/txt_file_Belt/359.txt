Victoria Beckham is obsessed with trousers. It's official. In the last week we've seen her in a new pair everyday, from tailored and chic, to relaxed and loose. And these ones, made from what looks like linen, are brand new, and from her spring summer 2017 collection. 
Being the designer, Victoria gets to wear pieces from a new collection whenever she wants, and she chose to wear these trousers on her way to her catwalk show during New York Fashion Week. 
Now that's a preview we like! 
This stone colour featured a lot in the new collection, mainly through the boots that went with almost every look. We love that she's teamed these with this stripe shirt. It's a casual-cool outfit that any woman can emulate. 
Every woman needs a good pair of trousers in her wardrobe, and even though you can't buy these now, you can shop her current collection by clicking on the right, or choose from one of the pairs we've found below.

     Speaking about her team to the Daily Telegraph, she explained: ‘I have a great team of people who work with me. I’m not doing this on my own.‘I think we have grown in confidence. I dress differently now to how I did then. I wear looser dresses, flat shoes. I can express myself in a different way.'I want to evolve each season. I never want to be one of those brands where people know what they’re going to see. I always want an element of surprise.'One thing I never want to do is copy what anybody else is doing. I have a signature, and it’s very important to me to stay true to that.’               Proud: David Beckham wrote a gushing message to his wife on Instagram saying he was 'very proud' of her.

     But Victoria looked ready for business as she made her way to her studio in a pair of heels - a rarity now that she often favours flat shoes.  She added to The Telegraph earlier this year: 'I just can’t do heels any more. At least not when I’m working. I travel a lot. Clothes have to be simple and comfortable.'This, despite once famously saying she didn't 'get' ballerina pumps.She growled: 'I beyond hate ballerina flats. I can't walk in them. Unless they're on a ballet dancer doing ballet, I just don't get it. I love heels. I hate my feet - they are the most disgusting thing about me.'
