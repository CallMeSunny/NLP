Abraham was growing in confidence now and dropped his gloves to invite Smith on before going back on the front foot and landing with more frequency.         Abraham gave an assured performance and won a unanimous decision against the challenger          Smith hits Abraham with a strong uppercut during their fight in Berlin The momentum was with Abraham but Smith is made of stern stuff and a big body shot appeared to rock his opponent, sending Abraham into his shell for the remainder of the sixth.Both men appeared to be tiring early in the seventh but a combination from Abraham sparked Smith to life with the Briton landing more body shots but a good left from Abraham in the closing stages rocked Smith again.Abraham appeared to be growing in confidence and was beginning to get through with more punches on the ropes and the challenger kept going back to the body as he was getting little joy with the jab.The German landed a good right hand just over a minute into the ninth and it was looking likely that the scorecards were getting away from Smith going into the last three rounds.Abraham kept coming forward in the 10th and landing with more and more regularity, a big right hand wobbling Smith who was looking weary but still battling against the man three years his senior.Smith seemed to find something else in the next but Abraham was sitting back now, clearly sensing that the job was done, and the German cruised through the last to retain his title.Abraham improved his professional record to 42-4 (28 KOs) after making the third defense of the title he won back from Robert Stieglitz by split decision in March 2014. Meanwhile, Smith dropped to 35-5 (20 KOs).          After the match, Abraham poses with his belt in his dressing room in Berlin   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Floyd Mayweather: I'm giving fans £160m Manny Pacquiao fight...
