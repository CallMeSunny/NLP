Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said yesterday that rival Ben Carson has a 'pathological temper' that can't be cured any more than a child molester can be cured.Trump first made the claim in an interview with CNN, then continued the strong criticism during a 95-minute rant at an Iowa rally.'If you're a child molester - a sick puppy - you're a child molester, there's no cure for that,' Trump proclaimed, other than what he called the 'ultimate cure' - and death.He said he didn't believe Carson's story about his religious awakening in his bathroom, either, and questioned the retired neurosurgeon's tale about nearly stabbing a friend. Trump imitated the incident, moving his belt up and down to demonstrate how difficult it would be to strike the buckle instead of flesh, and bellowed moments later, 'How stupid are the people of Iowa?''How stupid are the people of this country to believe this crap?' Trump said during the campaign event at Iowa Central Community College.Scroll down for video          Donald Trump said yesterday that he doesn't believe Carson's story about nearly stabbing a friend. He imitated the incident and said, 'Somebody hits me with a belt, it's going in, because the belt moves this way. It moves this way. It moves that way!'          'Anybody have a knife? You want to try it on me?' he asked. 'Believe me. It ain't gonna work.' Trump also compared Ben Carson to a child molester       In an interview with CNN, the businessman pointed to Carson's own descriptions of his 'pathological temper' as a young man.'That's a big problem because you don't cure that,' Trump said. 'That's like, you know, I could say, they say you don't cure — as an example, child molester. You don't cure these people. You don't cure the child molester.' Trump also said that 'pathological is a very serious disease.'CNN's Erin Burnett asked Trump if he was satisfied by Carson's assurances that his anger was in the past, and Trump said he didn't know. 'You'll have to ask him that question,' he said according to a CNN report on the interview. 'Look, I hope he's fine because I think it would be a shame.' Carson responded to Trump during an interview today with Yahoo News' Katie Couric. 'I guess someone needs to tell him what "pathological" actually means. Because it doesn’t mean that it can’t be cured.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Ben Carson calls convicted felon who defrauded insurance...

 'Perhaps some of his advisers can actually go talk to some people who understand what that term means and educate him until he wouldn’t say things like that,' Carson said.In his best-selling book, Gifted Hands, Carson described the uncontrollable anger he felt at times while growing up in inner-city Detroit. He wrote that on one occasion he nearly hit his mother with a hammer and on another he attempted to stab a friend with a knife.'I had what I only can label a pathological temper — a disease — and this sickness controlled me, making me totally irrational,' Carson said in describing the incident with his mom. He referred to 'pathological anger' again in telling about lunging at his friend, the knife blade breaking off when it hit the boy's belt buckle.Carson's ability to overcome his anger as well as an impoverished childhood to become a world-renowned neurosurgeon has been a central chapter in his personal story.         In his book Gifted Hands, Carson (seen above on Wednesday) writes of trying to stab a boy with a knife because of his temper, but hitting his belt buckle. He's since claimed his intended victim is a family member who wishes to remain anonymous       However, the Daily Mail this week discovered a 1988 interview in the Detroit Free Press's Sunday magazine that contradicts Carson's claim about the confrontation with his mother.The article states: 'His mother…remembers the time she and Bennie had a spat over clothes he wanted for school.'He raised his hand; she reached for the hammer she had out while working on the house. The two might really have tangled, she says, had not her older son Curtis....stepped in between them.'Mrs. Carson said at the time, 'I'm still working on my temper…but God seems to have done Bennie a really big favor.'During his rally Thursday night in Fort Dodge, Iowa, Trump told the crowd that 'Carson's an enigma to me' and questioned story after story in Carson's biography. He acted out the scene of Carson trying to stab his friend, lurching forward and shouting, 'but, low and behold, it hit the belt!''Somebody hits me with a belt, it's going in, because the belt moves this way,' he said, turning the belt up toward his face. 'It moves this way,' he said, tilting it down and away from him, as his audience giggled. 'It moves that way!' he said, flipping it up again.'Anybody have a knife? You want to try it on me?' he asked. 'Believe me. It ain't gonna work.' Since the inconsistencies in Carson's stories were discovered, he's said his intended victim was a family member - but he won't reveal the person's real name.Today he told Couric, 'If the media will promise that they will not bother this person or any of the other people, and if they promise that they will be honest, truthful and apply everything to everyone equally from now on, I will reveal the truth. Is that fair?''People are calling me constantly who’ve been — associated with me and telling me how they’re being harassed by the media, how people are calling them, people are showing up on their doorsteps with cameras,' he said. 'And, you know, they don’t appreciate it.''         Carson did not respond to his opponent's comments, but Carly Fiorina chimed in and said Trump has a pathological disease, too - lying          Fiorina posted this message on Facebook attacking Trump       Carson describes in Gifted Hands racing to the bathroom in his house after the near-stabbing incident and in time began to pray for God's help in dealing with his temper. 'During those hours alone in the bathroom, something happened to me,' he wrote. 'God heard my deep cries of anguish. A feeling of lightness flowed over me, and I knew a change of heart had taken place. I felt different. I was different.'Assessing Carson's religious awakening, Trump said his opponent went into the bathroom and came out and 'now he's religious.''And the people of Iowa believe him. Give me a break. Give me a break. It doesn't happen that way,' he said. 'Don't be fools.'Carly Fiorina joined the fray soon after, posting a message on Facebook attacking Trump.'Donald, sorry, I've got to interrupt again,' she wrote, mocking the comment he made to her a Tuesday's Republican debate. 'You would know something about pathological. How was that meeting with Putin? Or Wharton? Or your self funded campaign? 'Anyone can turn a multi-million dollar inheritance into more money, but all the money in the world won't make you as smart as Ben Carson.'Carson was just one of the White House contenders that Trump laid into on Thursday.Of Hillary Clinton, he said, 'She's playing the woman card up. That's all she has...Honestly, outside of the woman's card, she's got nothing going, believe me.' And Florida Republican Marco Rubio is 'weak like a baby,' he charged.
