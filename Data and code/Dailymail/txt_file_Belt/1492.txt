 'I believe I will dust him inside the first minute,' he said. 'He's a slower version of Aldo, he's a bum version of Aldo.'I will drag his head through the streets of Rio de Janeiro through a parade of people. It will become a national holiday.'It's all about who's true and who's not. I see a man who, although he's Brazilian, does not represent Brazil as he should.'I feel he is very, very sloppy. I feel his shot selection is very poor. He has this tenseness in his body when he loads.'He will try to close the distance but he will taste some strikes very early. It's like a slower, sloppier, more stuffed version of Aldo.                McGregor and Dos Anjos go nose-to-nose after exchanging words ahead of their fight at UFC 197'I will guide him on to some strikes and as he's been KO'd before, I'll KO him again. 'It will be another KO, I'd love to beat the ugly out of him and drag it into the second or third round but I feel like I'm going to dust him in under one minute.'McGregor opted to move up a division rather than defend his 145lb title although he could do exactly that at UFC 200 in July.And he added: 'I chose this one because I came into this promotion as a two-weight world champion.'I wanted to replicate that; that was the goal, to make history. This man across from me has a title but he has nothing else but that.'He's a free-TV fighter. He has nothing to offer me other than that belt.'         McGregor salutes the crowd at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas after a press conference with Dos Anjos         McGregor launched attack after attack at Dos Anjos and regularly spoke over the top of his opponent McGregor also claimed his opponent is not a 'true Brazilian' after leaving his homeland for California four years ago.'I'll send him back to California, his home,' he said. 'I swear to God, at UFC 194 I fought Jose Aldo, I KO'd the country of Brazil's true champion.'He never learned the language of his oppressor, he never came to America, he trusted his people, unlike this guy across from me.'That's why the Brazilian people love Jose Aldo. When he steps off a plane, his people greet him regardless of the result.'We're sending Rafael on a four-day media run throughout Brazil and we've got to book him a hotel. I have got to book him a hotel in his own country.'He will never receive a hero's welcome because he ran form Brazil. This guy, in Brazilian lingo, is a gringo.         McGregor knocked out Jose Aldo in 13 seconds in December to win the featherweight title         Dos Anjos celebrates his victory over Donald Cerrone that saw him hold on to his lightweight title 'Your kids names are Bob and Donald. Why are you raising American children? Why don't you trust in your own people?'You're going back to Brazil to answer that question while we pay for your hotel because you don't have a home over there.'Dos Anjos, who was subdued in the face of McGregor's repeated verbal onslaughts, replied: 'The whole world has American dreams. This country has people from all different parts of the word.'We have Irish, Brazilian and these people don't deserve to be called traitors.'This guy is calling me a traitor just because I live here but I have my kids here, I have my family.'I'm not a trash talker, I respect my opponents and I talk the truth.'On March 5 I will send this guy home sad and I am going to keep my belt.'I'm a complete fighter. I fight standing, I fight on the ground.'I beat Ben Henderson, Nate Diaz, Anthony Pettis, Donald Cerrone twice. I fought better guys, taller guys and stronger guys.'
