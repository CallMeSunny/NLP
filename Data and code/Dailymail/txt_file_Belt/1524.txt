Legal moves reflect growing fears over extent of Green Belt frauds By Tony Hetherington And Sarah Limbrick   Updated: 22:16 BST, 19 March 2011                     1 View  comments   'Buy land, they're not making it any more!' That was the investment advice traditionally attributed to Mark Twain. But now evidence is mounting that more than 100 companies have cheated investors out of hundreds of millions of pounds by selling plots of Green Belt land that are unlikely ever to be granted planning permission for development. And the directors of one sham land investment group are facing a High Court action to force them to hand back more than &pound;3 million that they allegedly stripped from their companies before they were shut down. Michael Morris and Stephen Meissner ran Land International and three connected firms from offices in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. They bought land at four sites, including locations near Swindon and Gatwick, for a total of £551,000 and sub-divided each field into house-size plots that they then sold for more than £6 million.         Worried: St Albans MP Anne Main 'finds this type of marketing deeply disturbing'   All four firms were closed down in 2008 after the Companies Investigation Branch of the Insolvency Service found investors had been cheated.  They were told that Land International would apply for planning consent that would send the value of the land soaring, but investigators discovered that Morris and Meissner had already been warned there was little or no chance of developing any of their sites.  Now lawyers for the liquidators of Land International are suing the two men, claiming that they unlawfully paid themselves or their wives £3.48 million while failing to keep proper accounts or pay taxes. The liquidators are also suing June Morris for £1.33 million and Karen Meissner for more than £283,000.  The legal moves over Land International reflect growing official concern at the scale of the 'land banking' industry. The Financial Services Authority has five active investigations going through the courts, involving more than £42 million of investors' money. Investigators are looking into a further 20 land companies.  This is despite the fact that the FSA has no power to regulate the sale of land. It can only intervene in 'collective investment schemes', when sellers also offer to manage the land and apply for planning permission on behalf of plot owners.  Jonathan Phelan, head of unauthorised business at the FSA, said: 'Many land banks are careful not to describe their operation as a collective investment scheme in their promotional material, so we cannot prove they are running these schemes without the help of investors.  'That is why we ask anybody who has dealt with a land bank to contact us. The information we get can help us protect hundreds, if not thousands, of potential investors.'  The watchdog Solicitors Regula-Authority also expressed concern-at the role played by lawyers in some land companies. Earlier this month it successfully applied to strike off solicitor Stephen Murrell, a director of Hamilton Bentley & Partners Limited.  According to the SRA, the company bought a field near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, for £45,000, divided it into 212 house-size plots and sold them for £1.6 million.  Investors were told to expect profits of up to 600 per cent but in fact their land is 'virtually worthless', says the SRA. Edward Richards, chairman of the solicitors disciplinary tribunal that expelled Murrell from the profession, condemned him as 'grossly reckless'.  He said: 'The involvement of a solicitors' firm was designed to give comfort to members of the public. We are satisfied that Mr Murrell played a controlling part in the catastrophic situation.'  Financial Mail warned in 2007 that Hamilton Bentley, run by Murrell and City stockbroker Stephen Todd, may have been operating illegally. The company was placed in compulsory liquidation last May, though Todd himself still appears on the FSA's register as a licensed broker.  The Government's recently formed National Fraud Intelligence Bureau is gathering information on all alleged land banking scams, searching for links between the companies and their personnel.  A number of those involved are known to have also been active in wine investment scams and marketing high-risk stocks and shares.  The NFIB has announced that recent intelligence led to four arrests by City of London Police at land company Brown & Mackenzie. Police put losses to investors at about £3 million.  As well as causing losses to investors, the land bankers often stir up local concerns over the future of Green Belt land. When land near St Albans, Hertfordshire, was offered for sale as if it could be developed for housing, there was a local outcry against marketing company Property Spy.  St Albans MP Anne Main said: 'I find this type of marketing deeply disturbing, it is also unsettling to residents who live close to the Green Belt and casts a doubt over the future of our countryside.  'Land sold in this manner often falls into a poor state of repair and then the unfortunate owner sells it on without planning permission ever having been granted.'
