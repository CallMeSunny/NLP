Wales manager Chris Coleman believes Belgium's 'conveyor belt' of talent saw them pull off their gamble in the French capital.Coleman was in Paris on Sunday night to see Euro 2016 qualifying rivals Belgium beat France 4-3 in a wonderful exhibition of attacking football which was only slightly spoiled by two late home goals.Dries Mertens and Jan Vertonghen both limped away from crunching French tackles but Coleman said the Red Devils' decision to risk injuries just five days before their vital European Championship qualifier in Cardiff was down to the depth of talent at their disposal.
