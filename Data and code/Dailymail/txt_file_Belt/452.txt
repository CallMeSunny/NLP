VIETNAM PRESS-Coffee region may grow macadamia as alternative crop - Vietnam Economic Times By Reuters   Published: 02:18 BST, 5 February 2015  |  Updated: 02:18 BST, 5 February 2015                e-mail         Vietnam's coffee belt could replace its old coffee trees and switch to growing macadamia as an alternative crop, the Vietnam Economic Times newspaper reported, quoting agricultural and banking experts at a seminar.Farmers could grow macadamia in part of the 100,000 hectares (247,100 acres) that need replanting in the Central Highlands, as it has a longer production life and prices of the nuts, used in confectionery products, are higher than that of coffee, the experts were quoted as saying.----NOTE: Reuters has not verified this story and does not vouch for its accuracy.
