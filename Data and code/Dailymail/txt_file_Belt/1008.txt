 James Maloney and Nathan Cleary will be reunited in Penrith's halves against Wests Tigers on Thursday night without a full training session under their belt, after Maloney's partner went into labour. Cleary was due to return to Penrith NRL training from a knee injury for the first time on Monday night, however Maloney will be absent from the session to be by his partner's side. With Wednesday's light captain's run the only other session this week, it means the two will go into Thursday's game without having played or trained properly next to each other since Cleary was injured on March 23.
