A jealous cannabis-smoking jailbird who hid overnight in the loft before throttling his high-flying career girl ex-partner to death has been jailed for life.William Mack, 39, laid in wait for more than 16 hours and then caught business risk manager Leanne Wall, 36, by surprise soon after she awoke.Fuelled by paranoia that she had cheated on him at a party, he headbutted her and then strangled her with a belt and his hands in what the sentencing judge called 'a callous pre-meditated and planned killing'.Friends and family of Miss Wall, who had a flourishing career at financial advisers St James's Place Wealth Management in Manchester, reportedly 'couldn't understand why she found him attractive', given Mack's lengthy criminal record which included a spell in prison.              Leanne Wall, a high-flying business risk manager, pictured left, was murdered by her cannabis-smoking former partner William Mack, shown on the rightUnemployed Mack threatened to kill Miss Wall the day before and also made clear his intentions to a friend in 'chilling' text messages, Manchester Crown Court heard.In one he wrote: 'Can't cope with this any more. I will take her out soon if this is not sorted out', while he later texted: 'I am going to do her in. We both lose. I will get locked up but at least I will still have a life.'When Miss Wall returned from work on February 11 she herself suspected that Mack had been in her house in Whitefield, Greater Manchester, as the kettle was still warm and some of her clothes were missing.She texted Mack - unaware that he was in the loft with a sleeping bag and food and drink - and later rang a friend to say she had heard noises in the house but thought it was her dog.Rob Hall, prosecuting, said the pair first met in 2009 shortly after Mack, who had a lengthy list of previous convictions, came out of prison after being jailed for wounding.

 Her family, he said, were baffled as to why Miss Wall  was with the regular cannabis smoker but they supported her nonetheless.However, the couple later moved in together and she fell pregnant after medication she was taking negated the effects of the contraceptive pill.Miss Wall was a 'doting mother', however their relationship was 'beset by problems' the court was told and there were a number of occasions on which both Miss Wall and Mack himself called the police over disputes. Mr Hall said: 'It may well be that the imbalance between Leanne Wall having her own home and career contributed to his paranoia that she would be unfaithful and leave him.'A pattern developed where Mack would respond unlawfully each time Miss Wall tried to end their relationship, he continued.Police were called to their home in Conway Avenue on a number of occasions dating back to February 2010.       William Mack (pictured) broke into her house when she was out and then hit in the attic all night, coming down in the morning when he headbutted her and throttled her with a belt          The victim's body's was found on her bed at the home she shared with the couple's 16-month old daughter Elise in Whitefield, who was unharmedIn December last year Miss Wall suffered bruising to her neck after Mack restrained her by the throat while the following month she dialled 999 to tell police that Mack had threatened to blow up her home with a gas explosion.No blast took place but Miss Wall asked for Mack to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act, the court was told.Mack's paranoia heightened following a birthday party they attended on February 6.Sentencing him to a mininum jail term of 16 years, Judge Patrick Field QC told the defendant: 'You convinced yourself quite wrongly that she had had sex with another man.'You were told on numerous occasions that this was not true. You chose to ignore that advice. You continued to be driven by jealously and possessiveness.              Miss Wall who worked as a business risk co-ordinator at a wealth management company is thought to have split with Mack in the weeks before her death last February         Mack was remanded in custody for reports. Elise is now being cared for by her grandparents Brian and Karen. Pictured is the scene in Bury, Manchester, after the murder'Leanne, it seems, asked you to leave the house once again but instead of leaving you hatched a plan to wreak revenge on her for rejecting you. 'Mack ranted at the judge during his sentencing and then to the public gallery containing members of Miss Wall's family as he was taken down to begin his life term with a minimum of 16 years behind bars. He told Judge Patrick Field QC at Manchester Crown Court: ‘I’m sick of sitting here and listening to you rip into me.'It’s all lies. If she didn’t want to be with me, why would she buy me two coats for Valentine’s Day? You’ve torn my life apart.’The court heard how Mack charged his mobile phone after murdering his ex-partner and then rang her parents to ask her to come to the house to pick up their toddler daughter, Elise.After the brutal attack he left his daughter alone in the house with the body as he tried to evade capture.He fled the house before they arrived and was later apprehended on the hard shoulder of the M60 motorway after he had earlier been spotted hiding in a back garden.When interviewed, Mack claimed a confrontation took place after he came down from the loft and he had only wanted to scare Miss Wall into telling 'the truth' about the party.Michael Lavery, defending, said: 'He acted abhorrently and is disgusted with himself. It is beyond his comprehension how he acted that day. He cannot understand what he did and why he did it.'Judge Field rejected Mack's version of events and told him his 'selfish act' had deprived his daughter of the love, nurture and support of her mother.Mack pleaded guilty at a hearing last week to her murder.               It is believed Miss Wall was at work when Mack turned up at the 1950s semi (pictured) with food and water and broke into the house before sneaking into the loft and lying in wait - leaving no signs of a break in
