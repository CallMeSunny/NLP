 'I had no idea if I was going to get any help. You would think if they see a woman with a pacemaker, they should think her heart's not good,' she said.'She [an elderly woman with a pacemaker] doesn't need to be put through the extra anxiety.'Ms Sweetnam also claimed her complaints to the airport and the Australian Federal Police were not taken seriously.'I can't understand how they can be so insensitive. It's rather horrifying when you find nobody takes notice,' she said.

Regrettably, there was a lack of evidence for charges to be laid.'Mrs Sweetnam has been the victim of a crime, and the individual who has committed that crime has undoubtedly ruined Mrs Sweetnam's experience of travel. 'We're completely sensitive to that and we're keen to ensure Mrs Sweetnam is looked after – and we hope we can restore her confidence to travel in the future.'Daily Mail Australia contacted the Australian Federal Police for comment.
