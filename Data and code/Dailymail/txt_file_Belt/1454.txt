Hollywood ending or the same old story? Six months after the release of a film in which Tony Bellew won a world title fight at Goodison Park, he returns to the scene on Sunday in a bid to land a belt at the third time of asking.Quite conceivably it will be the last such shot for the 33-year-old, who supports Everton and will need all the home advantages he can get against Ilunga Makabu when they fight for the WBC cruiserweight strap.In the Congolese southpaw, Bellew faces an opponent who lost his first professional fight and then won 18 of the following 19 inside the distance.        Liverpool-born Tony Bellew is looking forward to going toe-to-toe with Ilunga Makabu in front of his home fans         Bellew has said in the build up to his showdown with Makabu that it will be his biggest test of his career to date         Everton supporter Bellew poses on the pitch at Goodison Park ahead of his bout with Congo's Makabu              Toffees fan Bellew and fellow Brit Ricky Burns are both in action on Sky Sports 1 on Sunday nightThe challenge for Bellew is weathering what he admits could be a ‘brutal’ storm and then going better than he did in his last two visits to this level, when his challenges against Nathan Cleverly in 2011 and Adonis Stevenson two years later each ended in defeat.Bellew, the taller man, is convinced his size will be the deciding factor. He said: ‘Makabu has to make it as brutal as possible but I don’t believe he has the size and structure to do it.

   ‘I don’t think he’s got more power than me. I’m his biggest test and he’s mine. But we have records that suggest we both have vulnerable tendencies so anything can happen.’Bellew’s fight will cap a significant weekend for British boxing, with Ricky Burns chasing history when he contests the vacant WBA super-lightweight belt against Michele Di Rocco in Glasgow. Victory for Burns would make him the first ever three-weight champion from Scotland and only the second Brit to do so after Duke McKenzie.          Bellew celebrates after defeating Mateusz Masternak during his last fight in December 2015         Bellew, pictured in an Everton shirt, is hoping to win his seventh straight fight following his last defeat in 2013        Bellew (left) and Ilunga (right) come face to face as they gear up for their fight in Merseyside         Burns looks quietly confident as he poses on the scales in Glasgow ahead of his fight with Michele Di Rocco   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       '20 years of my life goes into 36 minutes': Tony Bellew...
