 John Wall has a second full-contact practice under his belt, but still isn't sure when he'll return to the lineup for the Washington Wizards. Wizards coach Scott Brooks has already ruled Wall out for Tuesday night's home game against the San Antonio Spurs. The Wizards have lost three in a row. Wall, speaking for the first time since undergoing left knee surgery seven weeks ago, told reporters he felt good on Monday. Wall also he'd dropped 10 to 15 pounds while rehabbing the knee. No timetable for Wall's return has been decided by the Wizards, who will await a final decision from their medical staff. Wall has missed the Wizards' last 25 games due to the injury. Washington is 14-11 in those contests. Named an All-Star earlier this year for the fifth time, Wall is averaging 19.4 points and 9.3 assists this season. The Wizards are sixth in the Eastern Conference at 40-33. --Field Level Media
