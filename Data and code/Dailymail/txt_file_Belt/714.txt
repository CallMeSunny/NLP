House prices across England have dropped for the first time since 2012, while prices in London are falling at the fastest rate in ten years. The average price of a home in England fell to £255,683 after a nationwide drop of 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared to 2018. Buyers appeared to be spooked by Brexit uncertainty, particularly in London and the south-east. Prices in the outer Metropolitan area are down 2 per cent and the Outer South East area is down 1.1 per cent as London’s chill ripples outwards.         House prices in London fell annually at the fastest pace since 2009 in March, according to Nationwide, but estate agents report a busy start to the year as buyers take advantageBut homeowners in Northern Ireland, the North West, and the Midlands were more insulated - with prices are rising between 2.5 per cent and 3.3 per cent annually.  Londoners meanwhile saw their properties plummet in value - with a 3.8 per cent drop over the past year, according to the Nationwide house price index. Buyers in the capital also appeared to be put off by a higher rate of stamp duty on second homes.The average home in London is now £18,000 cheaper than a year ago, at £455,594, figures show, in the biggest drop since the worldwide financial crisis in 2008.

 Analysts also warned that international buyers - who usually prop up London's market - are also being deterred by Brexit. While it was the seventh consecutive quarter of falling house prices in the capital, estate agents have reported a recent pick-up in the capital’s housing market as buyers take advantage of the dip. And London is still the most expensive part of the UK to buy a property. The average house price off £455,594 is more than twice the national average.   Guy Gittins, managing director of estate agent Chestertons, said: 'It was almost inevitable that the uncertainty of Brexit would drag property prices down, especially as the date gets closer and many buyers take a ‘wait-and-see approach’.          House prices across the UK have fallen back since last summer and the national average inflation figure could soon follow London and the South East into decline         House prices in London and the South East are considerably above their pre-financial crisis peak, while in northern regions they are either marginally higher or still below that level and in Northern Ireland they are 37% down'However, we have experienced an incredibly busy start to the year, with a sharp increase in buyer registrations, viewings and offers, which reflects pent-up demand and suggests that prices are now at a level that buyers are comfortable buying.' More volatile monthly figures showed the UK average house price up 0.2 per cent in March.Commenting on London and the South East's slide, Robert Gardner, of Nationwide, said: ‘This trend is not entirely unexpected, however, as it follows several years of sustained outperformance which left affordability more stretched.         Nationwide's map shows how house price declines (in red) are still confined to the southern part of the UKPolicy changes that have impacted the buy-to-let market in recent years are also likely to have exerted more of a drag in London, given that the private rental sector accounts for a larger proportion of the housing stock in the capital than elsewhere in the country.‘More widely, prices across the South of England (and to a lesser extent in the Midlands) are also well above pre-financial crisis peaks, while those in Northern England, Wales and Scotland are still close to 2007 levels.‘However, prices in Northern Ireland are still more than 35 per cent below the all-time highs recorded in 2007.’A number of factors have been credited with triggering the slowdown in the property market, ranging from MPs' bungling of Brexit sapping confidence, to home buyers struggling with high house prices and stretched affordability.Despite that property transactions outside of London and the commuter belt have held up relatively well, supported by low mortgage rates, the return of wage growth, and high employment.Mr Gardner said: ‘Indicators of housing market activity, such as the number of property transactions and the number of mortgages approved for house purchase, have remained broadly stable in recent months, even though survey data suggests that sentiment has softened.         Stuttering house prices combined with rising wages have slightly improved the house price to earnings affordability measure, but property remains almost as expensive as it has ever been ‘Measures of consumer confidence weakened around the turn of the year and surveyors report that new buyer enquiries have continued to decline, falling to their lowest level since 2008 in February.‘While the number of properties coming onto the market has also slowed, this doesn’t appear to have been enough to prevent a modest shift in the balance of demand and supply in favour of buyers in recent months.’
