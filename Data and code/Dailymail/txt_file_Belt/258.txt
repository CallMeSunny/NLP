With 21 Oscar nominations under her belt, Meryl Streep has seen it all. But this, it seems, was a first. Not able to make it to the annual all-star Oscars nominees luncheon, French filmmaker Agnes Varda, 89, sent along a collection of cardboard cutouts in her place.And Meryl, 68, was left in a fit of giggles by the cheeky poses of the absent Agnes, who variously hugged a cat, scowled slightly, and made a joke of her petite frame by reaching up to grab her collaborator JR's hat.         And the Oscar for the best no-show goes to! Tickled Meryl Streep in fit of giggles after French filmmaker Agnes Varda, 89, sends cardboard cutout to take her place at annual nominees luncheon in Los Angeles on Monday         I'd rather be home with my cat: Agnes, 89, and JR, 34, are nominated for Best Documentary Feature for the crowd-funded Faces Places, which won the prestigious l'œil d'or at the Cannes Film Festival         Too funny: With 21 Oscar nominations under her belt, Meryl Streep has seen it all. But this, it seems, was a firstAgnes and JR, 34, are nominated for Best Documentary Feature for the crowd-funded Faces Places, which won the prestigious l'œil d'or at the Cannes Film Festival. The film chronicles a road trip in which the two traveled around France in JR's van, meeting ordinary people and telling their stories of small town life. Agnes's cut outs, ably posed by street-artist JR, were the talk of the day as the nominees gathered to congratulate each other during a glamorous lunch at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills.While Belgian-born Agnes was busy elsewhere - attending an event in France - there was no absence of A-list stars on the red carpet.          more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  Jeremy Meeks and Andreea Sasu stuns on the red carpet at Cannes       Watch video  Stormi interrupts Kylie Jenner promoting her skin care line       Watch video  Blac Chyna opens up and tells all on her plastic surgeries       Watch video  Susanna Reid's mum angrily lambasts Piers Morgan over text on GMB           Watch video  MAFS' Ines Basic shows off her new porcelain veneers       Watch video  Mick Jagger's still got the moves after major heart operation       Watch video  Matilda Brown welcomes baby boy with MKR's Scott Gooding       Watch video  Alessandra Ambrosio wears breathtaking red ensemble at Cannes           Watch video  Isaac Kappy accuses Seth Green and James Gunn being pedophiles       Watch video  'I wanna be as famous as Marilyn Monroe': Gemma Collins in LA       Watch video  Katie Price shows off dazzling teeth during trip to Turkish dentist       Watch video  Elton John and Taron Egerton perform emotional duet at premiere

              She had better things to do: Agnes was attending an awards bash in France, but her collaborator, street-artist JR, made sure she was represented at the all-star Oscars luncheon         Talk of the day: Agnes posed as if she was tweaking JR's hat for one of her many cutouts         She;s a bit wooden: Greta Gerwig stood next to the cardboard Agnes

Margot Robbie and Allison Janney, both nominated for the film I, Tonya, arrived within minutes of each other. Margot wore a white and black mini dress with strappy black heels and a black Chanel purse while Allison showed off her lovely figure in a fitted black dress and pointy black pumps.Mary J Blige was one of the first on the carpet as she stunned in a white suit. The singer turned actress added a wide belt and knee-high boots. The 47-year-old star has been nominated twice for the film Mudbound: for Best Supporting Actress and Best Original Song.           more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  Jeremy Meeks and Andreea Sasu stuns on the red carpet at Cannes       Watch video  Stormi interrupts Kylie Jenner promoting her skin care line       Watch video  Blac Chyna opens up and tells all on her plastic surgeries       Watch video  Susanna Reid's mum angrily lambasts Piers Morgan over text on GMB           Watch video  MAFS' Ines Basic shows off her new porcelain veneers       Watch video  Mick Jagger's still got the moves after major heart operation       Watch video  Matilda Brown welcomes baby boy with MKR's Scott Gooding       Watch video  Alessandra Ambrosio wears breathtaking red ensemble at Cannes           Watch video  Isaac Kappy accuses Seth Green and James Gunn being pedophiles       Watch video  'I wanna be as famous as Marilyn Monroe': Gemma Collins in LA       Watch video  Katie Price shows off dazzling teeth during trip to Turkish dentist       Watch video  Elton John and Taron Egerton perform emotional duet at premiere
