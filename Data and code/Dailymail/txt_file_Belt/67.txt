 LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond plans to attend China's 2019 Belt and Road forum later this month, the Treasury said, subject to a clear parliamentary schedule. Hammond met the Chinese Minister of Finance, Liu Kun, on Friday at an IMF meeting. The two will also discuss British-China bilateral economic and financial cooperation when Hammond is in Beijing. The first summit for Belt and Road - which envisions rebuilding the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond with massive infrastructure spending - was in 2017.
