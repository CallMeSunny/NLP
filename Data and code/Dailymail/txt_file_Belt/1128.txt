Kristi Yamaguchi became the second American figure skater to hit Nancy Kerrigan below the belt on Monday, with the Olympic gold medalist using an insensitive tweet as her weapon on choice.The winner of the 1992 Albertville Games posted a message on Twitter wishing Kerrigan luck on the first episode of 'Dancing With the Stars,' writing: 'So excited for you @NancyAKerrigan! Can't wait to see you grace that ballroom floor, break a leg!' The turn of phrase was perhaps not the best choice given that Kerrigan almost did break a leg 22 years ago after being brutally clubbed in the knee by a man who had connections to her teammate Tonya Harding weeks before the 1994 Olympics.Kerriagn took it all in stride though, and responded with her own tweet mocking Yamiguchi, writing: 'Thank you @kristiyamaguchi for the advice! It definitely is helping!'           Grace: Nancy Kerrigan competed on 'Dancing With the Stars' for the first time on Monday night (above)         Terrible turn of phrase: Former Olympic gold medal winner and teammate Kristi Yamaguchi wished her luck on Twitter and told her to 'break a leg'         Finding humor: Kerrigan jokingly responded to Yamaguchu by writing: 'Thank you @kristiyamaguchi for the advice! It definitely is helping!'Kerrigan's response came 48 hours after Yamaguchi's initial tweet, with her first attempt to respond Monday night failing to make much sense.'Thank you so much Kristi! I'm excited to get this started said for the advice you had for me. this its a blast!' wrote Kerrigan.She later blamed that nonsensical tweet on poor eyesight, writing: 'Just was looking at this, I am adjusting to new contacts...#oops!' Kerrigan would be wise to take any advice Yamaguchi has to offer, with her friend having won the sixth season of the show.     RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       EXCLUSIVE - Love is in the air: Ivanka Trump drops the kids...

 Just before Kerrigan was set to compete in the 1994 Olympics she was clubbed in the knee as she left a practice facility.Kerrigan was practicing for that year's US Figure Skating Championships in Detroit when she was attacked by Shane Stant.It was later revealed that Stant had been hired by Harding's husband Jeff Gilloly bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt to break Kerrigan's leg so she could not compete at the Olympics.Harding denied ever having any knowledge of the situation and in the end Kerrigan recovered and received silver, while Harding finished in eighth and left the sport in disgrace. In March of that year, Harding pleaded guilty to conspiring to hinder prosecution of the attackers and was put on probation and ordered to perform community service.Soon after, Harding was stripped her of her 1994 US Championship title and banned from participating in US Figure Skating Association events as either a skater or a coach for the rest of her life. She would later write in her 2008 autobiography The Tonya Tapes that she wanted to notify the FBI of Gilloly's plans, but he silenced her by allegedly gang raping her at gunpoint with two strangers.         Champion: Yamaguchi (above with Mark Ballas) won the sixth season of Dancing With the Stars         Yamaguchi also won the gold medal at the 1992 Albertville Games while Kerrigan took the bronze (l to r: Kerrigan, Yamaguchi, Midori Ito)In a 2014 interview, Kerrigan said that at the time she really wanted to believe Harding was not involved in the bizarre plot to destroy her career.'I truly wanted to believe that she had nothing to do with it at all,' the 44-year-old said on Morning Joe.'Because how could that seem possible that someone you know, I mean we were competitors, but... we were friendly. So to think that anyone you know would deliberately try to hurt you, yeah, it's too bizarre to understand.'She later spoke abut how she was left in a complete state of disbelief.'I can remember saying even to the FBI, "Well, maybe Tonya really didn't know. Maybe they did it for her."' she recalled.'And they're like, "Nancy, we can't prove it, but we think she was the mastermind of the whole thing."'         Back in the day: Two years later Kerrigan almost broke her leg in an attack organized by Tonya Harding's husband and bodyguard (l to r: Harding, Kerrigan and Yamaguchi in 1992)At that point, she said she felt 'disappointment, sadness.' And while Harding still denies having any role, Kerrigan said she doesn't believe her.'Why would the people around her want to hurt me? What did they have to gain? I guess she's the only one who really had anything to gain. And I was told "I know we can't prove it but we're telling you. She did." I hated hearing it. It stinks. It's sad on so many levels,' said Kerrigan.When asked if she had forgiven Harding for what happened, she said she did not think about it much, especially since she is now a busy mom-of-three.'I don't know. I don't think about it really. When I read transcripts from the FBI, they planned to kill me at one point. That was one of the options. To kill me over a sporting event. That's crazy,' she said.'There were all these other brutal options that they were thinking about doing to me. I've moved on i don't think about it as forgiveness. I just hope she's happy... and can be able to move on.'
