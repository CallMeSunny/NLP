James DeGale has blown his chance of a stadium-filling showdown with domestic rival Callum Smith after scraping a majority draw against Badou Jack at the Barclays Center in New York on Saturday night.DeGale was knocked down in the final round of their IBF and WBC super-middleweight title bout but clung on to hear the final bell where scores of 113-113 (twice) and 114-112 in favour of DeGale were announced.The verdict meant DeGale kept hold of his IBF portion of the 12-stone title but failed to add Jack’s WBC belt, for which Liverpool’s Smith is the mandatory contender.

Now it’s not going to be in a unification fight, but I get to fight for one of them anyway.”DeGale had knocked Jack down in the opening round but his opponent grew into the bout and finished the stronger of the two, flooring the Londoner with a shot that ultimately cost DeGale the victory.And Smith’s promoter Eddie Hearn also admitted plans for a prospective showdown between DeGale and Smith – which could have taken place at Anfield – will now have to be put on hold.What a night. I almost knocked out the ref too 😂😂😂 good night/morning ✌🏾😴#jackdegale pic.twitter.com/o2IlMJJ9Ox— Badou Jack (@BadouJack) January 15, 2017  Hearn said: “James DeGale wanted to fight Callum Smith and vice-versa. But it doesn’t matter. All that matters is that he (Smith) is fighting for the WBC title.”DeGale’s record now stands at 23 wins, one draw and one defeat from his 25 professional contests, and he revealed afterwards that the bout had taken its toll.The 30-year-old told Sky Sports 1: “He busted my ear drum and I lost my teeth. I thought I’d done enough but it was the knockdown.“I’ve had 25 fights, I’m going to get better, I want the rematch! I’m glad I’m still the champ and I’m coming home with the title but I’m so upset that I didn’t come with the WBC belt.I was built for nights like tonight. Big city. Bright lights. FIGHT NIGHT! 🇬🇧👊💥#teamchunky #jackdegale #champvschamp pic.twitter.com/pHWw0YZxzK— James DeGale (@jamesdegale1) January 14, 2017  “The main thing is I didn’t lose, I’m still the champ and I can move forward.”After such an exciting contest a rematch against Jack could potentially bring big money but the WBC champion shrugged off DeGale’s suggestion of an immediate rematch.And Jack’s promoter Floyd Mayweather, who expressed anger with the majority draw verdict, also confirmed that his charge will now pursue his career in the heavier category.Mayweather said: “We don’t need to figure it out, I’m the promoter, this is my fighter. Badou Jack has got too big for 168lbs. We have plans after this fight to move up to light-heavyweight.”
