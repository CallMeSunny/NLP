Amir Khan risks committing professional suicide if he goes through with his bid to box in the Rio Olympics this summer.Doing so on behalf of Pakistan would threaten to alienate much of his support in Britain, for whom he won a silver medal at the Athens Games.That double whammy – which looms ominously following his statement on a visit to Karachi that he wants to represent his family’s country of origin in Rio - would hit him even harder than the punch from Canelo Alvarez which rendered him unconscious in Las Vegas last month.         Amir Khan has said he would want to fight in the Olympics in Rio this summer but for Pakistan         A young Khan poses with his silver medal which he won at the Olympics in Athens back in 2004The potential damage to Khan’s professional future would begin with prohibition of the world title fight in which he hopes to come back from the knockout which ended his bravura challenge for Alvarez’s middleweight championship.Khan is in negotiation for a re-match with Danny Garcia, who inflicted one of his two previous KO’s but for whose welterweight title he is now the mandatory challenger.But the WBC, whose belt would be at stake, has now confirmed its intention to suspend for two years any of its highly-ranked fighters who elect to compete in Rio following the contentious decision by the world governing body of amateur boxing, AIBA, to admit professionals to the Olympics.That ban would apply to all WBC champions and the next 15 in their ratings in all weight divisions.

   Khan is the No 1 contender at welterweight and the mandatory challenge to Garcia was his insurance against likely defeat when he gambled by going up in weight for his mega-fight against Alvarez.As it stands, that represents his only realistic chance of an immediate return to the ring in a high-profile, big-money fight.Khan is no longer ranked among the top 15 contenders by any of the other world title sanctioning bodies. Not by the WBA, IBF or WBO.That would preclude official sanctioning for a challenge to WBA champion Kell Brook in what was being touted as a huge domestic showdown before the Alvarez thunderbolt struck.Khan promptly stiffened his opposition to that match, saying: ‘It is now past its sell-by date.’         Khan returned to Pakistan and received an award upon his return stating he wants to fight for the country         The Bolton boxer poses with guards who were instructed to protect him at every turn Brook, who had previously been calling out Khan on a daily basis, has changed his position, saying: ‘It is not safe for Khan to fight me after yet another knockout, the heaviest of them all.’That leaves the WBC, whose president Mauricio Sulaiman says: ‘The WBC reiterates its total opposition to allowing professionals to fight amateurs in Rio 2016. This is a scenario where severe mismatches could end in tragedies.‘All our champions and top 15 ranked boxers are forbidden to participate. If they do so they will be banned for two years.’Khan has expressed his delight that the Pakistan boxing federation is seeking approval for him to represent them at the Games, even though he boxed for Britain in Athens. That implies his acceptance of the British Amateur Boxing Association’s determination to remain faithful to its boxers who have been fighting their way through the long qualifying competition.The WBC position is supported at the professional level by the British Boxing Board of Control, whose general secretary Robert Smith says: ‘We are in constant contact with them on this issue. It is a matter of serious consideration for Amir.                The former two-time champion was knocked out after stepping up to face middleweight Saul Alvarez in May AMIR KHAN CAREER STATS Total fights: 35Wins: 31Wins by KO: 19Losses: 4  ‘I cannot see any chance at all of the WBC relaxing their position before the Rio Games begin in August. Nor do we think they should.’The backlash in Britain against the prospect of Khan switching allegiance to Pakistan has begun in earnest on social media, with vehement criticism rife on Twitter among other platforms.The Bolton-born-and-bred Khan’s following in the UK has remained largely loyal even though eight of his nine fights in the last five years have taken place in the US, with his most recent in this country being a scratchy win over the lightly-regarded Julio Diaz three years ago.There was much appreciation of his silver medal-winning exploits in Athens, not only as a teenager but as the only member of our 2004 boxing team. That has been bolstered down the years by his courageous stance, as a devout Moslem, against Islamic extremism and terrorism.         Super-bantamweight Carl Frampton said the decision for professionals to fight at the Olympics is ridiculous         New cruiserweight world champion Tony Bellew is another fighter against the move for pros to face amateursWhen the possibility of pros going to Rio first arose his talk of a desire to improve his Olympic record to gold was received with understanding. But saying now that he ‘would love’ to do that in Pakistan colours has ignited outrage.Khan, although more matured now at 29, still has a tendency to knee-jerk reaction. When asked about the Olympics during his charity visit to Pakistan, his response was couched in courtesy for the other country which he and his family hold dear.I very much doubt he realised the adverse reaction it might provoke here, as well as throughout the sport of boxing at large.Now, with his career at risk of being compromised at a critical stage and public opinion in some quarters here turning against him, I hope this well-meaning young man takes time out to fully think through the implications of reawakening his Olympic dream.Fight Danny Garcia, Amir. Not the world.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Anthony Joshua shows off punching power ahead of maiden IBF...    Ricky Hatton feasts on mammoth 'Benidorm breakfast' as...
