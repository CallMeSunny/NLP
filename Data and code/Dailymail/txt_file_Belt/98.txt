Even though it decided to boycott China's first Belt and Road Forum (BRF), China's richest man - the billionaire head of Wanda Group, Wang Jianlin - praised India's economic potential at the summit and highlighted his group's ambitious plans for India.Wang, head of China's powerful conglomerate with vast investments in real estate, development projects and in the film industry, was the most prominent Chinese businessman at BRF, which was inaugurated by President Xi Jinping on May 14. Among 29 foreign powers, India was the only major country absent at the summit, with the U.S., Japan and South Korea also sending delegations.
