The comfortable careers and high pay of workers in London have produced a ring of long life around the city, according to a new analysis.It found that nine out of ten of the areas of the country where people can expect the longest lifespans are among the well-heeled suburbs of the capital.Researchers pointed to healthy lifestyles and good incomes as key reasons why pensioners around London have formed a longevity belt unmatched elsewhere in the country.The findings from a report by financial advisors Willis Towers Watson underline the links between earnings and lifestyle in pushing up life expectancy.          A new analysis shows nine out of ten of the areas of the country where people can expect the longest lifespans are among the well-heeled suburbs of the capital         It said that in the 10 longest-lived postal areas the average life expectancy is more than 89 years.Only one of the areas placed at the top of the life expectancy table is far from London – Harrogate in North Yorkshire, where the survey figure, which applies to both men and women, put life expectancy at 89.47 years.The bottom 10 areas, where life expectations for men and women are put at less than 88 years, are all in the north of England except for two in Scotland.The figures, drawn from deaths recorded by defined benefit pension schemes, provided a contrasting picture to state life expectancy tables produced by the Office for National Statistics.

 The most recent figures from the ONS, which give life expectancy for babies born between 2013 and 2015, put the figure for a newborn boy at 79.2, and the greatest lifespans for men in Kensington and Chelsea in London, at 83.4.For women, the ONS say life expectancy for a newborn girl over the same two years was 82.9, with the top female life expectancy, in Hart in Hampshire, reaching 86.7 years. The ONS figures are based on death registrations and population estimates.  REVEALED, THE POSTCODE LIFE EXPECTANCY LOTTERY   TOP 10 BEST PERFORMERS   TOP 10 WORST PERFORMERS   Kingston upon Thames  89.74 Sunderland 87.50 Hemel Hempstead 89.71 Liverpool 87.62 Guildford 89.71 Hull 87.64 Slough 89.70 Motherwell 87.66 St Albans 89.49 Wigan 87.77 Harrogate 89.47 Manchester 87.81 Redhill 89.43 Glasgow 87.87 Bromley 89.31 Durham 87.90 Harrow 89.31 Darlington 87.94 Watford 89.28 Sheffield 87.95   Stephen Caine of Willis Towers Watson said: 'There are distinct differences in life expectancy in different areas of the country but in reality it is not the geography itself that is important, it's the economic and lifestyle factors that are indicative of residents in different areas of the country.'What this research highlights is that pensioners living in the outer ring surrounding London are the most likely to have had well-paid jobs and to have enjoyed a relatively comfortable and healthy working life which, alongside other factors, are strongly linked to longer lifespans.'He added that the area where people choose to live in retirement can have an impact on their income.         Researchers pointed to healthy lifestyles and good incomes as key reasons why pensioners around London have formed a longevity belt 'Postcodes, when used in tandem with other factors, are a powerful predictor of life expectancy and are used by many areas of the financial services industry,' Mr Caine said.'Insurers take postcode into account when people go to buy a pension annuity at retirement.  Postcodes, when used in tandem with other factors, are a powerful predictor of life expectancy and are used by many areas of the financial services industry Stephen Caine of Willis Towers Watson'Similarly for employers that support a defined benefit pension scheme, our postcode mortality analysis helps those running the scheme understand the life expectancy of their own membership in order to better judge how much money needs to be put aside now to pay pensions in future.'The figures from the financial survey were calculated using figures including death rates, pension levels and the likelihood that people smoke. The findings for men and women were averaged out to give a single figure covering both sexes.ONS analysts link increasing lifespans to the decline of heavy industry, which has led to safer and healthier jobs for many men; to improving living standards and healthier lifestyles, and to medical advances and the conquest of many diseases. However, the ONS has also found that in recent years the lifespans of men have been catching up towards those of women.
