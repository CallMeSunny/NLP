Go space age chic in Stella's silver bomber jacket by Gucci




Gucci crackle leather bomber jacket
Steal Stella's style!



Visit site



She strutted her stuff on the Balmain SS16 catwalk today, and somehow model Stella Maxwell manages to look just as good when she's not on duty.
She made the streets of Paris her very own runway as she left the show with fellow beauty Bella Hadid. And whilst she kept things simple with an all-black ensemble consisting of skinny jeans and a crop top, it was her bomber jacket that really made the style statement! 
It's by Gucci and we love the metallic crackled leather material as well as the varsity stripes on the collar and cuffs. The sports luxe look isn't go anywhere next season (check out today's Chloé show if you don't believe us!) so it's one that's definitely worth investing in. If you fancy splashing the cash then click (right) to buy Stella's exact silver jacket now. 
But if you want a space age-inspired bomber jacket that won't cost the earth, our edit below is the place to go. Monki's version at Asos is a must have! Then mix things up and team it with an on trend midi skirt.
