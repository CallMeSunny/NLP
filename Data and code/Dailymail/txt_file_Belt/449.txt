She's the glamorous boss of Ultimo, and Michelle Mone was out in full force promoting her brand in Liverpool today.
The blonde bombshell has worked the tailored look before in a Suzanne Neville gown, and stuck to her structured guns in this head-to-toe look by Victoria Beckham. 
We love the sleek silhouette Michelle has created in the classic shirt and trousers combo, given a slightly dominatrix edge with this Ultimo harness. 
While the harness may not really be an every day look, we can certainly pull off her wide leg trousers by Victoria Beckham - in this versatile cut and colour, they will work for any occasion. Seeing as they're VB, these trousers are a tad pricey, but if you want to invest, you can snap them up now by clicking the link (right). 
Or get the look for less with our picks from Topshop, Nasty Gal, ASOS and 3.1 Phillip Lim. We've added Michelle's exact shirt too, so you can recreate her look in full. No need to thank us!
