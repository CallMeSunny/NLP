Singh then came back into the ring, took the microphone and said: "I don't want this title. I will give it back to Zulpikar." He added: "I don't want tension on the border. It's a message of peace. That's important." The countries have been involved in a lingering dispute over a contested region high in the Himalayas where China, India and Bhutan meet.
