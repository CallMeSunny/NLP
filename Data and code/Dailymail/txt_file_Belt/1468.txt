Astounding signs of a hidden giant planet on the fringes of the solar system was uncovered by scientists back in January.The mysterious world, nicknamed Planet Nine, is thought to be about 10 times more massive than the Earth, gaseous, and similar to Uranus or Neptune.While no conclusive evidence of its existence has emerged so far, a number of researchers have undertaken their own studies on the possible planet, which is also referred to as or Planet X.The most convincing so far is a recent study by scientists at the University of Arizona, who looked at the high eccentricity of distant Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs).Scroll down for video          Astounding signs of a hidden giant planet on the fringes of the solar system was uncovered by scientists back in January.

 Planet Nine is, on average, about 20 times further from the sun than Neptune, which orbits at a distance of about 2.8 billion miles.Back in January, its existence was inferred from the gravitational influence it has on several Kuiper Belt objects with highly unusual orbits.The clinching evidence came from a prediction that a ninth planet would result in Kuiper Belt objects having orbits inclined perpendicularly to the plane of the planets.         The six most distant known objects in the solar system with orbits exclusively beyond Neptune (magenta) all mysteriously line up in a single direction. Such an orbital alignment can only be maintained by some outside force, Batygin and Brown say. The January paper argues that a planet with 10 times the mass of the earth in a distant eccentric orbit anti-aligned with the other six objects (orange) is required to maintain this configuration       In the last three years, four objects were found that behaved in this way.'We plotted up the positions of those objects and their orbits, and they matched the simulations exactly,' said Professor Mike Brown, from Caltech, one of the astronomers who announced the discovery.Caltech colleague Dr Konstantin Batygin said: 'Although we were initially quite sceptical that this planet could exist, as we continued to investigate its orbit and what it would mean for the outer solar system, we became increasingly convinced that it is out there.'For the first time in over 150 years, there is solid evidence that the solar system's planetary census is incomplete.'The latest study by Arizona University proposes an alternative explanations, according to Universe Today.  NASA WARNS ITS TOO EARLY TO CONFIRM IF PLANET NINE REALLY EXISTS    In January, Nasa warned that claims of a new planet lurking in our solar system are premature.The space agency said that the controversial Caltech paper claiming a ninth planet exists beyond Pluto was 'just a prediction'.It called for caution - but pledged 'if it's there, we'll find it.'In a YouTube video, Jim Green, director of planetary science at Nasa addressed the new findings.'The January 20 paper in the Astronomical Journal is fueling our interest in planetary exploration,' Green said. 'Stimulating a healthy debate that's part of the scientific process.'It is not, however, the detection of a new planet. It's too early to say with certainty that there's a so-called 'Planet X' out there. He pledged Nasa experts would take part in the process to try and find it.'It's all about starting the process that could lead to an exiting result.'If Planet X is out there, we'll find it together. Alan Stern, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute who is the principal investigator for NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto and beyond, was also sceptical. 'This is about the fifth or 10th prediction like this. … Not one has panned out,' he said 'If they do find it, it'll be more like Number 19, not Number 9,' he told GeekWire in an email.          It suggests that if Planet Nine were crossing paths with high-eccentricity Kuiper Belt objects, there was a good change it was in resonance with these objects.'We have these six observed objects whose orbits are currently fairly unaffected by the known planets in our solar system,' the researchers told Universe today in an email.'But if there's another, as yet unobserved planet located a few hundred AU from the sun, these six objects would be affected by that planet.'Their findings could help to pin down Planet Nine's possible location.But the researchers admit several unknowns remain, and further studies of these objects need to be undertaken before they can come to any conclusion.'There are a lot of uncertainties here,' they told Universe today.'The orbits of these extreme Kuiper belt objects are not very well known because they move very slowly on the sky and we've only observed very small portions of their orbital motion.         The putative ninth planet—at 5,000 times the mass of Pluto—is sufficiently large that there should be no debate about whether it is a true planet. A recent study by the University of Arizona has found that Kuiper Belt objects with a highly eccentric orbit may be on a path that is in a predictable pattern with Planet Nine's orbit
