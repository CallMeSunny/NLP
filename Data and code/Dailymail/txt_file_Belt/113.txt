 The accident reportedly took place in the district of Guangfeng in Shangrao City in eastern China's Jiangxi Province.Traffic camera footage from Yongfeng North Avenue shows the silver van entering a crossroads when it crashes head-on into another van coming from its right side.The violent collision causes the silver van to spin 360 degrees, with the passenger door breaking open and the woman being forced out the vehicle in the process.         The woman's torso remains inside the van during the spin thanks to her seat belt, and she is kept in her seat as the vehicle comes to a stop during the recent accident in Jiangxi ProvinceIn the video, the woman's arms and legs can be seen flailing outside the van as the force of the spin begins ejecting her from her seat, threatening to throw her onto the road.However, her torso remains inside the van during the spin thanks to her seat belt, and she is kept in her seat as the vehicle comes to a stop.A local policeman told Chinese video news site Pear that the seat belt saved her life and prevented her from suffering any serious injuries.The officer reiterated the importance of buckling up for drivers and passengers. He said the woman was unharmed during the accident. WHO: 260,000 people are killed on the road in China every year         Chinese police inspect a damaged truck and cars after the accident in Lanzhou, China, on November 4, which left at least 15 people killed and 44 injuredRoad accidents remain one of the top causes of death and a sensitive social issue in China.Approximately 260,000 people die as a result of traffic accidents in China each year - in comparison to the worldwide figure of 1.25 million people - according to a 2016 report from WHO. The number puts China, the world's most populous nation, in the second place globally after its neighbour India.China has the highest road deaths involving children in the world. According to figures released by Chinese state media in 2015, more than 18,500 children under the age of 14 are killed by traffic accidents every year in the country. A lack of road disciplines, poor road conditions in rural areas, light punishment for violators, polluted air and even bystanders' unwillingness to help out are all potential factors. WHO's figure is about four times the official number released by the Chinese authority, which claimed that 63,000 people were killed on the road in 2016.WHO also points out that of the total estimated road deaths in China, around six out of 10 are vulnerable road users including pedestrians, cyclists and people on motorcycles.
