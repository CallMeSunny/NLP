         e-mail          25 View  comments    The mother and grandparents of a 7-year-old Pennsylvania boy were arrested last week after an investigation revealed that the mother allegedly had beaten and starved the boy to the point that he only weighed 25 pounds.The investigation was set in motion when Mercer County Youth Services sent caseworkers to the family's home in Greenville, where they saw that the boy was 'clearly under weight' in early June.Caseworkers took the unidentified boy straight to the UPMC Horizon hospital before he was transferred to UPMC Children’s Hospital in Pittsburgh, where he reportedly has gained 20 pounds since he first arrived on June 6.        House of horrors: Police say the boy was never let out of the house except to sit on the porch, where he would catch and eat bugs  On Wednesday, the boy's mother, Mary C. Rader, 28, and grandparents, Dennis C. Beighley, 58, and Deana C. Beighley, 47, were arrested following an investigation by county prosecutors. According to the criminal complaint, first obtained by the Sharon Herald, the boy had been living with his mother and grandparents, as well as two sister and a brother. The report states that the sisters, ages 11 and 4, were healthy. The 9-year-old boy also in the home was under weight, but not nearly as badly as the 7-year-old.The complaint alleges that Radar took the boy out of school in August of 2013. The only time the boy was allowed of the house was to sit on the back porch, where he told investigators that he would often catch bugs and eat them.        Siblings: The boy had siblings who were not treated nearly as badly as he was, according to police  The boy's siblings told investigators that he was only fed small portions of of tuna fish and eggs, and that he was frequently beaten with a belt. They say he was usually beaten when he would try to sneak peanut butter and bread to eat without permission. The siblings say the only time the boy was able to bathe was when he was being punished and was drenched with ice-cold water.

 'The child was starved. (The victim) is the worst case of medical neglect that I have ever seen in my seven years as a pediatrician,'  Dr. Jennifer Wolford of UPMC Children’s Hospital Child Advocacy Center told the paper. 'Multiple physicians at Children’s Hospital are in agreement with this assessment. There is not one physician at Children’s who disagree with this assessment.'In addition to the starvation and beatings, the boy had two teeth that were abscessed and had to be removed.         Prisoner: Police say the boy was never allowed to leave the house after his mother took him out of school in August 2013  'The most important medicine used to treat him at the hospital was food. He was within a month of having a major cardiac event that he probably would not have recovered from,' Dr. Wolford said.'It is impossible to me that this severe neglect and active abuse was not visible. He was being starved in his own home around others of normal weight,' she continued.The boys mother and grandparents each face two counts of aggravated assault, aggravated assault of a victim under 13, unlawful restraint of a minor, false imprisonment, endangering the welfare of children, and criminal conspiracy.They were released on bond and are scheduled to appear in court again on July 30.
