 Less happy though, are the sport's purists, who believe it is time McGregor finally defended his belt against a legitimate No 1 contender, rather than No 6 ranked Diaz. That would mean facing the winner of this Saturday's UFC 216 interim title showdown between Kevin Lee and Tony Ferguson.And the 29-year-old says he has heard the calls of fans to legitimise the title, and the sport.         A trilogy bout with Nate Diaz would likely be the biggest MMA fight in history 'Look, I've got the UFC title to defend and that means something to me. I will defend that world title,' McGregor declared, speaking to Caroline Pearce at An Evening with Conor McGregor at the SEC Armadillo.'Nathan (Nate Diaz) is there. He's trying to come in here and make all of these demands. If he starts pricing himself out of an event, I probably will defend against the person who wins this interim belt…or someone along that line to legitimise it again.'I've already gone from the highest of the high in terms of a money fight. Now the question I always get is about defending the belt and legitimising the sport and the rankings.'Maybe now it would be a good time for me to go and do that and shut that side up.' 'Again, we'll see what happens in the fight next week (between Lee and Ferguson). I hope they make the walk. I've seen it so many times where they slip on the bleedin' soap getting out of the bath,' he said.          Tony Ferguson (left) and Kevin Lee (right) will fight for the interim lightweight title at UFC 216'I've done the money fight. I've done the pinnacle of a money fight – I fought for the money belt – the WBC money belt it was called,' said McGregor, in reference to the Mayweather fight.'In my head now, I'm very interested in seeing this fight this weekend and to see how the lightweight title picture pans out and to go in and correct that whole situation. That's where my thoughts are.'I also have history with Nate. It's 1-1 and that has to happen. It will happen. The more I spend time away from it, I think I've already done all of the money fights. Now, to legitimise a title and to bring it back, I could potentially bring it back.'That's a little bit exciting for me. I'll see how this whole title picture plays out and we'll go from there.'
