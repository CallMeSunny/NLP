 Feasibility studies are to be carried out into options to reduce cross-border train journey times, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced. The studies mark the next phase in plans to eventually cut the journey time between Scotland’s central belt and London to three hours. Last year, the UK and Scottish governments jointly commissioned work to identify options for improvement on the east and west coast rail corridors.

This feasibility study will also consider the potential for new cross-border stations within the Eurocentral business park and on the existing rail network near Livingston. Addressing business leaders in Newcastle, Ms Sturgeon said: “I am determined for us to take the necessary steps to secure Scotland’s future and improve our connectivity with England. “This work will provide us with the knowledge to make informed investments in the next 10 years and move us towards our goal of a three-hour journey time to London and substantially reduced journey times to the cities in between. “It is fitting that I am able to make this announcement while speaking to the North East England Chambers of Commerce. This work could have significant benefits for people and businesses on both sides of the border.

With this in mind we welcome major steps to reduce journey times, like those announced today by the First Minister. “Businesses north of the border rely heavily on their ability to connect with the north of England, London and the rest of the UK, so any measures which significantly reduce rail travel time will bring real benefits.”
