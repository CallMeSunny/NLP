         e-mail          11 View  comments    Dereck Chisora could be one win away from a second challenge for the WBC heavyweight world title after Vitali Klitschko vacated the belt.The Ukrainian effectively announced his retirement as he focuses his attention on his presidential campaign ahead of the country's elections in 2015.And while Chisora is expected to miss out in the race to fight for the vacant title, his ranking of No 6 should be enough to earn him a shot at the next champion.      Waiting for a chance: Dereck Chisora hopes for a second shot at the WBC world heavyweight title next year   WBC HEAVYWEIGHT RANKINGS1 Bermane Stiverne2 Chris Arreola3 Deontay Wilder 4 Bryant Jennings 5 Mike Perez6 Dereck Chisora7 Manuel Charr 8 Tyson Fury 9 Tomasz Adamek 10 Odlanier SolisConvention would suggest that the No 1 and No 2 ranked contenders - Bermane Stiverne and Chris Arreola - will fight for that right.But they met last April with Stiverne winning a wide points decision and there seems little merit in a rematch.That could open the door to undefeated knockout artist Deontay Wilder who has stopped every one of his 30 opponents inside four rounds.'Dereck is in a very good position in as much as I'm quite sure they'll make Wilder against Stiverne,' Chisora's promoter Frank Warren told Sportsmail.'Dereck will fight again in February and with a win he'll move into a position where he'll have to be considered for title defences.'      Priorities: Vitali Klitschko has vacated his WBC title to focus on running for president in Ukraine in 2015      Second time lucky? Chisora unsuccessfully challenged Klitschko for his heavyweight title in 2012    Chisora, who holds the European title, fought Klitschko for his belt in Munich in 2012, losing on points.His impressive showing was overshadowed by his behaviour at the weigh-in, when he slapped his opponent, before the fight when he spat water in Wladimir Klitschko's face, and by his brawl with David Haye at the post-fight press conference.Since then however, barring a defeat to Haye in the ring last July, Chisora has successfully rebuilt his career with stoppage wins over Malik Scott, Edmund Gerber and Ondrej Pala.He will return to action at the Copper Box Arena in London on February 15.  perform.init({playerId:
