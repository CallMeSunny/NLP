 The San Francisco Giants reinstated first baseman Brandon Belt from the 10-day disabled list Tuesday. Belt, 30, missed 17 games because of a hyperextended right knee. He sustained the injury July 25 against the Seattle Mariners. Before the injury, Belt was hitting .278 with 14 home runs and 43 RBIs in 85 games. His .372 on-base percentage is the second-highest mark of his career. The Giants went 8-9 with Belt out of the lineup. He also spent time on the disabled list in June after emergency surgery to remove his appendix. In a corresponding move, the Giants optioned right-hander Pierce Johnson to Triple-A Sacramento. Johnson, 27, was 3-2 with a 5.72 ERA (25 earned runs in 39 1/3 innings) in 31 relief appearances for San Francisco this season. --Field Level Media
