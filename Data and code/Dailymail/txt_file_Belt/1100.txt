WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SPACE ROCKS? An asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions or the early solar system. Most are located between Mars and Jupiter in the Main Belt.A comet is a rock covered in ice, methane and other compounds. Their orbits take them much further out of the solar system.A meteor is what astronomers call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up.This debris itself is known as a meteoroid. Most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere.If any of this meteoroid makes it to Earth, it is called a meteorite.Meteors, meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets.For example, if Earth passes through the tail of a comet, much of the debris burns up in the atmosphere, forming a meteor shower.
