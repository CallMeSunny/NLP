       In tune: Gemma Arterton - who will take to the stage for Made In Dagenham Gemma Arterton was in a recording studio giving full belt to two of the songs that will be among the big numbers featured in the musical Made In Dagenham, about the historic industrial action at Ford Motors when women machinists demanded equal pay.Actually, Gemma gave me a private sampling from one number during Charles Finch’s swanky party at Eden Roc during the Cannes Film Festival.I didn’t know it, but it was called Stand Up. It’s a rousing wake-up-call sung by Rita O’Grady, the woman Gemma will play in the musical, which has been written by Richard Bean with music by David Arnold and lyrics by Richard Thomas.I’ve heard several other songs and they’re incredibly powerful.‘They’re punchy and touching’, Gemma said.She said the women in the show remind her of relatives she was close to when growing up — ‘working class, full of beans, funny and witty’, she recalled.And saucy, too, from the dialogue I’ve heard.But Gemma said she was angered that the UK is still unequal when it comes to pay for women. ‘It may have passed into law, but it’s still not in the workplace,’ she thundered.It saddens the composer, too. ‘There’s still so much discussion about women working and not being fairly paid,’ said Arnold.He stressed the importance of the show, which opens at the Adelphi Theatre on October 9. ‘We’re looking at the past with a view to the future and the present. You can look at what happened to the Dagenham women with the benefit of hindsight and contemporise it without moving out of the Sixties’.Listening to the score and hearing titles such as Everybody Out and Stand Up, I was struck by how it resonated with the sense of industrial conflict.Arnold said it was very natural to him because his parents worked at the old Electrolux factory in Luton. ‘My dad was a big sort of socialist, though he wasn’t involved in any industrial action,’ he said.He said Amy Winehouse’s Back To Black album was a starting point with the score because it evoked a sense of the Sixties with a contemporary twist, with a nod to U.S. rhythm and blues.He said to try to imagine the likes of Bruce Springsteen, and producers Phil Spector, George Martin and Marc Ronson, trying to make a record with a bunch of picketing women who won’t take no for an answer.                   Outspoken: Gemma says she is angered the UK is unequal when it comes to pay for women              Gemma will sing those songs along with Adrian Der Gregorian, Steve Furst, Sophie Stanton, Heather Craney, Sophie Isaacs, and Julius D’Silva; with Sophie Louise Dann playing Barbara Castle and Mark Hadfield as Harold Wilson.But before rehearsals start with director Rupert Gould, Gemma will star opposite Idris Elba In the film One Square Mile. It’s about ‘love, action and gangsters in London’, she said.  Hurrah! There’s more time to Bring Up The BodiesHilary Mantel has the theatre world in her grip. The stage productions of her two best-selling novels will extend their run in the West End, and moves are afoot to transfer them to America.The Royal Shakespeare Company productions of Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, about Henry VIII’s master schemer Thomas Cromwell, have become phenomenal hits since they transferred from the RSC’s base at Stratford to the Aldwych Theatre in May.The limited run was to have ended at the Aldwych on September 6, but the two plays will continue for a further four weeks through till October 4.        Style: Lydia Leonard as Anne Boleyn and Ben Miles as Thomas Cromwell  So far a stunning £7.6 million worth of tickets have been sold for the top-notch costume dramas. There are still some seats available in July and August, but they are all but flying out of the box office.It’s rare that non-musical productions become such mega-hits.‘The momentum is with us,’ said Matthew Byam Shaw of Playful Productions.Playful acquired, and retain control of, the stage rights, but entered into what has become a most fruitful  co-production agreement with the RSC to adapt the plays for the theatre.Byam Shaw knew something was up when requests for house seats (the handful of seats retained by the producer and theatre owner), started piling up like crazy. Royalty, Cabinet ministers, movie and tv stars have been the recipients of the secret stash of seats.Byam Shaw noted that Mantel herself has seen the plays dozens of times, and indeed she has tickets to see the double bill again tomorrow.In fact, I sat next to her and husband Gerald McEwen when I caught director Jeremy Herrin’s production a few  weeks ago. The author has  become close to the ensemble, particularly Ben Miles who plays Cromwell. She also enjoys the company of cast members such as Lydia Leonard, who plays Anne Boleyn, Lucy Briers (Katherine of Aragon), Paul Jesson (Cardinal Wolsey) and Nathaniel Parker (Henry VIII).Now, I learn, discussions are underway about taking Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies to North America. Nothing has been decided, but there are ongoing unofficial negotiations about taking the plays to Los Angeles, Toronto and then New York next year. Why Nighy’s hot propertyBill Nighy called David Hare’s play Skylight ‘funny, accessible and romantic’, adding that he liked its sense of civic responsibility.He and I were chatting a while back, long before he started rehearsing with co-stars Carey Mulligan and Matthew Beard and director Stephen Daldry.After watching a preview at Wyndham’s Theatre, I would add the word incendiary.                     Brilliant: Bill Nighy and the fiery Carey Mulligan  The play’s hotter than I remembered when I first saw it with Michael Gambon at the National and the performances at Wyndham’s are scorching.During a brief conversation, Hare noted that Carey’s ‘firing on every cylinder’ as Kyra, who meets up with her wealthy former lover, Tom (Nighy), at her spartan council flat, and I added that Nighy was giving the performance of his life.The play stands up, too, as if it was written yesterday. It’s electrifying.NT Live will show Skylight at cinemas around the country on July 17.  Tom Hiddleston told fans in an online chat that he’s been listening to music by Hank Williams, the legendary country singer who sang hits such as Hey, Good Lookin’ and Your Cheatin’ Heart. Tom’s been singing along to Hank, playing the guitar and having singing lessons because he will portray the late singer in a movie that starts filming later this year, after he’s finished High-Rise with Sienna Miller, Jeremy Irons and Luke Evans.
