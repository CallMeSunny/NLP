I've watched The Wolf of Wall Street about 12 times. Actually, 14 now, but who's counting? I want to be the wolf. Who wouldn't want to be The Wolf of Wall Street?'Kimberly told the camera: 'I feel like Sean puts way too much importance on material objects and he doesn’t have any idea bout how fortunate he is to have what he does have.'
