The green belt is being sacrificed to provide hundreds of thousands of homes – most of which will not be ‘affordable’, campaigners have warned.Around 425,000 homes are proposed for the green belt under local and regional planning policies, analysis by the Campaign to Protect Rural England suggests.The figure is up 150,000 from its last study in March 2016.But more than 70 per cent of the homes earmarked to be built will not be ‘affordable’, the research said.

 Most building plans for the green belt were a ‘shocking waste of land’, that were too low rise, aimed at the high end of the market, and failed to house many people, the CPRE said.It also found that fewer than one in six of the homes that have been built on the green belt since 2009 have been affordable.Affordable housing is defined in several ways. It includes social housing – offered at lower than market rents. It also includes houses sold at lower than market value and shared ownership schemes, which allow those with small deposits to get on the housing ladder. Green belt – which is designated to prevent urban sprawl – is facing particular threat in the North West, West Midlands and South East, the CPRE’s Green Belt Under Siege report found.The report said: ‘Overall, the trend we see for low density development in the green belt is a shocking waste of land, not only in itself but because real social need will continue to go unmet, thereby increasing the pressure for further releases of green belt land later to meet genuine need – as opposed to market demand.’         Green belt – which is designated to prevent urban sprawl – is facing particular threat in the North West, West Midlands and South East, the CPRE’s Green Belt Under Siege report found.

It also wants a focus on building on brownfield land in towns and cities that is suitable for redevelopment.Tom Fyans, of the CPRE, said: ‘Green belt is being lost at an ever faster rate, yet the type of housing being built now or in the future will do very little to address the affordable housing crisis faced by many families and young people.‘We must not be the generation that sells off our precious Green Belt in the mistaken belief it will help improve the affordability of housing.         ‘We must not be the generation that sells off our precious Green Belt in the mistaken belief it will help improve the affordability of housing'.

This Government is committed to protect the green belt. Only in exceptional circumstances may councils alter green belt boundaries.‘We’ve been clear that councils must prioritise development on brownfield land, and announced plans to radically boost brownfield development.’Billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money is being used to help wealthier people buy bigger homes rather than helping lower paid workers to get on the property ladder, a report says.Research for the Social Mobility Commission found that around three in five first-time buyers used the Government’s Help to Buy scheme to buy a more expensive property or one in a better area than they planned originally.The average income for buyers benefiting from Help to Buy support was £41,323 but less than half of working-age households earn more than £30,000.
