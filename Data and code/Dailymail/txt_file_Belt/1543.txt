A British couple have moved to Mallorca for a year and will commute to London for meetings claiming it will help them save a deposit for their first home.Ryan and Kiera Crabbe believe it makes more financial sense to live 800 miles from the capital in Spain than live in the city or the surrounding commuter belt.The self-employed couple, who both earn more than £50,000-a-year, say they can now save £2,000 every month thanks to lower rent and household bills on the Balearic Islands.If they had stayed in Kensington, west London, where they lived for the past year, they believe that they could only save £600 a month. And if they need to be in London or other cities for meetings they can always pick up budget flights to Britain for £60 return.         Ryan and Kiera Crabbe are living in Mallorca for a year because it will be easier to save the deposit they need for a London home         They can now save £1,400 a month more now compared to if they had stayed in their Kensington flat (pictured)Mr and Mrs Crabbe have a deposit fund of £48,000 and believe that they can raise it to £75,000 by the end of their Spanish adventure.This would cut the time they need to save the cash by two years and allow them to put down a deposit for a small flat in their favoured borough of Kensington and Chelsea.The couple, who have been together since 2009 and married in 2015, are both self employed so can work from home most of the time, Ryan told MailOnline: 'We're lucky we can live abroad and continue to earn what we did at home.

 'As we are freelancers we can work from anywhere and we knew we could live more cheaply in Mallorca. 'We save £400 a month on rent compared to the £1,400 we paid in London before we lived for free in Kensington.'We can work just as easily in Mallorca as we can London. I have to fly back occasionally to meet clients face to face but can book return flights for about €70 [£61], which is cheaper than some train tickets when you live outside of London'. Last year they were lucky enough win a rent free year in a Kensington studio flat after answering a few questions and completing some basic household tasks against the clock. As part of the competition organisers B committed to match the savings the winner put aside while living in the flat.This meant they ended up with £48,000 at the end of the year – £24,000 of their own savings and the same matched by B.          Ryan and Kiera in 2017 after they won a competition to live rent free in Kensington for a year         They saved £24,000 and the bank who offered them the chance to live there matched their savings meaning they now have £48,000              B is a digital banking service from Clydesdale and Yorkshire bank that helps consumers manage their finances through an app        Ryan said: 'Kiera and I were incredibly fortunate to win the B app competition as it meant that we got to live rent-free flat for a year and as part of that we knew if we saved £2,000 a month between us, B would match that. So we saved £48,000 in total in a year. 'When our rent-free year was up, we were looking at places to buy or rent in London but we weren't sure where we wanted to live. We considered moving out of London but we then had to think about the commuting costs and it wasn't very appealing'.He added: 'Once we have saved up enough of a deposit we plan to come back and buy in London. The lessons we've learnt in how to budget will hopefully stay with us forever'.
