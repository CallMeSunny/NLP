It was the night of Naomi Campbell's Fashion 4 Relief party and the celebrities turned up in their droves to help the appeal and bag themselves some designer goodies in the process.
Tons of designer pieces old and new had been donated to the appeal and star's such as Rebecca Ferguson jumped at the chance to help.
She might still be battling her baby weight, but you would never have known it. She looked gorgeous at the party in a black croc skater dress which she accessorised with a chunky gold belt.
The dress is such a classic. It will hide tummies when you're feeling self-conscious and it's simply chic.
She jazzed up her look with red leopard Kurt Geigers which ensured the look packed a punch.
You can snap up her dress (right) at John Lewis and bag the heels (below) from Kurt Geiger so you can channel her look properly.
