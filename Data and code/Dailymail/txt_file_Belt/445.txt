 The San Francisco Giants made a handful of roster moves Thursday, including placing first baseman Brandon Belt on the 10-day disabled list due to a hyperextended right knee. Third baseman Evan Longoria was activated from the DL as part of the roster shuffle. Belt was injured in the Giants' game Wednesday after leading off the seventh inning with an infield single. He advanced to second on a throwing error before being removed for pinch runner Chase d'Arnaud. Belt had hoped the injury would be minor enough to only miss a day or two, but tests performed in San Francisco on Thursday indicated otherwise. Belt, 30, has hit .278 with 14 home runs and 43 RBIs in 85 games this season. This is his second stint on the DL following an emergency appendectomy last month. Meanwhile, Longoria returns after missing six weeks with a left hand fracture sustained when he was hit by a pitch. The 32-year-old is batting .246 with 10 homers and 34 RBIs in his first season with the Giants following a 10-year stint in Tampa Bay. In other roster moves, the Giants recalled left-hander Ty Blach and right-hander Chris Stratton from Triple-A Sacramento. Blach had been optioned to Sacramento after Wednesday's game, along with infielder Kelby Tomlinson. --Field Level Media
