 LOS ANGELES (AP) - The Latest on Democrat Josh Harder defeating U.S. Rep. Jeff Denham in California's farm belt and other congressional races in the state. (all times local): 7 p.m. As ballot-counting continues, Democrats gained ground in two undecided House races in the one-time Republican stronghold of Orange County, California. Meanwhile, in the Central Valley farm belt, first-time candidate Josh Harder defeated four-term Republican U.S. Rep. Jeff Denham following an updated vote count Tuesday, giving Democrats their fourth pickup of a GOP House seat in California. Two other House races remain too close to call. In the 45th District in Orange County, Democrat Katie Porter jumped into a 261-vote lead over Republican Rep. Mimi Walters, after trailing the incumbent since Election Day. And in the 39th District, anchored in Orange County, Democrat Gil Cisneros tightened the gap with Republican Young Kim. With Harder's win, Democrats will hold at least a 43-10 edge in California U.S. House seats. ___ 6:25 p.m. Democrat Josh Harder has upset U.S. Rep. Jeff Denham, a four-term Republican from California's farm belt. Harder was declared the winner Tuesday as updated vote totals showed that his lead was insurmountable. It's the fourth Republican-held US House seat in California picked up by Democrats. Divisions over President Donald Trump, health care and the #MeToo movement shaped the race in the Central Valley's 10th District. Harder, a 32-year-old venture capitalist, argued Republicans in Washington are not doing enough to help an area with high poverty. He also criticized the 51-year-old Denham for voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Two other U.S. House races in Southern California's Orange County remain too close to call.
