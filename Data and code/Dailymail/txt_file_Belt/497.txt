The woman hurt her hand trying to free herself but couldn't get loose.Fellow employees helped release her.Salt Lake City fire spokesman Jasen Asay says paramedics got the woman breathing again and she was taken to University Hospital.University spokeswoman Maria O'Mara says it's not clear whether the store had any clothing guidelines for students working on the equipment. The university would not release the woman's name or condition Thursday.
