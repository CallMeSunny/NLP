The CrownBurchetts Green, Berkshire01628 824079Rating: The Crown is a small, rambling and low-eaved pub in Burchetts Green, a small, rambling and ever-so-slightly smug commuter-belt village somewhere to the west of Slough. The minuscule bar, barely large enough to swing a half-grown hobbit, is hung with gleaming copper pans, and sits below a sort of monochrome shrine to two towering figures of French gastronomy: Eugénie Brazier, that formidable Lioness of Lyon, the first woman to ever achieve three Michelin stars, and Fernand Point, another Lyonnais legend, perhaps one of the greatest chefs of them all.Many would argue that Point, as mentor to Paul Bocuse, Alain Chapel and the Troisgros brothers, was the godfather of ‘La Nouvelle Cuisine.’ You know, all those square plates, strange smears and incongruous slices of kiwi fruit that so delighted the upmarket Eighties sophisticate. Minimal portions at maximum prices, eaten by braying box-shouldered, bouffant-haired Filofax-fiddlers. So why the hell are we thanking the man? Surely banishment to the Bastille was the only fit and proper punishment, to live out the rest of his wretched days with nothing but a crateful of physalis fruit to feed his eternal shame.

Because nouvelle cuisine – as preached by critic Henri Gault, in his ‘Manifesto’ of 1973, and practised by Bocuse et al – was, in principle at least, a truly revolutionary thing. It aimed to break free from the heavy sauced tyranny of cuisine classique, throw off the icy shackles of the refrigerator, and embrace the judiciously fresh. Out went old-school Escoffier excess, the ritual incineration of fish, fowl and flesh, the epic, multi-volume menus and instinctive fear of change. In its place, a new levity, and purity, in thrall to the future, not chained to the past.‘Every morning, the chef must start again at zero, with nothing at the stove,’ said Point. ‘That is what real cuisine is all about.’ Before tucking a vast linen napkin into his equally vast chest and devouring a trio of roast chickens, alongside two bottles of Champagne. For breakfast.Like his hero Point, Simon Bonwick, chef proprietor of The Crown, starts each day from scratch. Unlike Point, he does it all alone. OK, so the front of house is beautifully run by a team made up from four of his nine children. This is very much a family affair. But Bonwick’s Michelin-starred kitchen has no sous or chef de partie, no commis or even plongeur. It’s just Bonwick, a fan oven, plus a couple of induction hobs. Which makes the unashamedly French food that emerges from this tiny room all the more remarkable.Tables are wooden and unadorned, the cutlery Laguiole, and the wine list as interesting as it is well-priced. Langoustines, so blessedly fresh they haven’t even seen the fridge, are tumbled in the lightest of mayonnaise and served on a plain white plate, perched upon a square of crisp toast. Purity, pleasure and precision.Confit chicken oysters are mixed with chunks of just-translucent scallop, and drenched in a gravy (or jus, if you must) of such ridiculous richness and depth that it not only covers the lips with sticky delight. But coats my entire day with savoury glee. The flavours may be big and bold, but the technique is elegantly expert.

A trio of textures that scampers across the tongue with giddy springtime glee. Lamb rump next, none of that insipid spring lamb nonsense, rather lavishly, lasciviously fatty, old enough to know a thing or two about flavour. Pert spring vegetables, handfuls of thyme and more sticky, intensely lip-smacking ‘rather nice’ lamb sauce. With a couple of extra jugs full of the stuff in case we need more. Which, of course, we do.There’s a joyous generosity here, not just in the serving, but the entire spirit of the place: in the bowls of buttery, garlicky pommes purées, and the vast plate of well-kept cheese with home-made flapjacks, and the huge raspberry bavarois, with just the right wibble of wobble, and a mouthful of startling fine raspberry sorbet, and the icy home-made raspberry eau de vie.For a kitchen of four people, this would be remarkable. For a one-man operation, it’s a downright miracle. Bonwick is the sort of chef I adore most, a man still in love with the tireless clatter of pots and pans. His average working day is 19 hours long, and his margins must be minuscule. He’s certainly not doing this for fame or fortune.But ‘success,’ as Point once wrote, ‘is the sum of many small things done right.’ At The Crown, lunch is more than success. It’s a tear-jerking triumph. Point would be proud.Lunch £28 per headWHAT TOM ATE THIS WEEKMondayLunch at Le Gavroche, to celebrate this great restaurant’s 50th anniversary. Risotto with cockles and cod stomach, roasted sweetbreads, slow cooked shoulder of Herdwick lamb, then chocolate mousse. Sublime. Three generations of Roux, plus the likes of Tom Kerridge, Angela Hartnett, Richard Corrigan, Sat Bains, Monica Galetti, Marcus Wareing, Rowley Leigh and, er me. Give dinner a miss. Obviously.         Fattoush saladTuesdayLunch with my children, sister and nephews and nieces at The Wolseley. My son devours a dozen native oysters. As do I, along with steak tartare, then off to Matilda, which is sublime, and blub copiously at the end. And this coming from a person who hates musicals. Then a farewell to our friend Bernie Katz at The Gorucho. Dinner rather liquid.WednesdayUrgh. Time to give belly and liver a break. Daylesford soup. A few packets of natto. No grog. And early to bed with an advance copy of The Angry Chef by Anthony Warner, a brilliant book which brilliant blows up the myths of detox, clean eating and other nefarious ‘wellness’ rubbish.ThursdayBack to work. A very jolly lunch at The Palomar off Shaftesbury Avenue. Shakshukit, Jerusalem mix, fattoush salad and lots more, Still as fresh tasting and fine as ever. Then off to La Famiglia in Chelsea for dinner, for my friend James’s birthday. Smoked cheese wrapped in ham, then gramigna alla montanina, rich with pancetta, pecorino and tomato. Old-school Italian.         Smoked cheese wrapped in ham
