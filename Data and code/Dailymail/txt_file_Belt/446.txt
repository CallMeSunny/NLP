 The San Francisco Giants reinstated first baseman Brandon Belt from the paternity list before Saturday's game against the Oakland Athletics. Belt, 30, missed only one game after the birth of his son. He tweeted a picture from the hospital, where he sat next to his newborn and watched the Giants play on a television screen in the room. Entering Saturday, Belt is hitting .287 with 13 home runs and 42 RBIs in 81 games. He has a .383 on-base percentage and a .480 slugging percentage for a combined .862 OPS, which is the second-best mark of his career. The Giants optioned infielder Ryder Jones to Triple-A Sacramento to clear a spot for Belt. The 24-year-old Jones went 1-for-4 with a solo homer in his season debut Friday. --Field Level Media
