 LONDON (AP) - British boxer James DeGale lost his IBF super middleweight belt when he was beaten by Caleb Truax by majority decision at the Copper Box Arena on Saturday. One judge scored it 114-114 but other scores of 115-112 and 116-112 for the American challenger handed DeGale only the second defeat of his career. DeGale was making the fourth defense of the title he won in 2015, and fighting on home soil for the first time in more than three years. The former Olympic champion made a good start in his first action since January, but Truax took charge from the fifth when he backed DeGale into the ropes and bloodied his nose. DeGale sensed late that he needed a knockout but Truax stood firm and dropped to his knees at the final bell, believing he'd pulled off a surprising win. His record improved to 29-3-2, and he becomes a world champion for the first time at age 34. DeGale dropped to 23-2-1. Also, Lee Selby of Wales, the IBF featherweight champion, defeated Eduardo Ramirez of Mexico by unanimous decision. Selby's belt was not on the line because Ramirez was eight pounds over the limit, but both were keen to put on a good show. The judges scored it 118-110, 119-109, and 116-112. Selby improved to 26-1, and Ramirez's record dropped to 20-1-3.
