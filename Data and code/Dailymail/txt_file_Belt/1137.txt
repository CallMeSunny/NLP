Get it spot on in a polka dot dress by Emilia Wickstead

Emilia Wickstead's designs are just so instantly recognisable that we reckon we would have spotted Hannah Bagshawe's dress a mile away even if she wasn't at an Emilia Wickstead event! 
She and Eddie Redmayne attended a Christmas Cocktail party at the London Flagship store, and of course Hannah was wearing a hot off the catwalk dress. This SS17 collection piece is typical of the label's aesthetic, and it's easy to see why the Duchess of Cambridge is one of Wickstead's biggest fans! 
We love the ankle-grazing length and polka dot print on this dress, which Hannah teamed with perspex panel heels, a colour block clutch bag and a tailored coat. Unfortunately her dress isn't yet available to buy but click (right) to browse the current line at MATCHESFASHION.COM. 
Or shop the Emilia Wickstead-esque options we've rounded up for you in the edit below. This Coast dress is top of our shopping list!
