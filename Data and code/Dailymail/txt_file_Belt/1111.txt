What with Madonna being Madonna she was hardly going to turn up at an MTV event looking all Mother of the Bride.
Queen Madge, who turned 60 last year, proved age is just a number as she was spotted in London last night, wearing what can only be described as the most dominatrix outfit we've seen...well...ever (we've lived a sheltered life). 
Her stylist Eyob Yohannes, who pulled the ensemble together, opted for labels labels labels with a custom blazer by Keko Hainswheeler and Gregory Kara, a Burberry wool trench and Miu Miu shoes.
And whilst we're seriously coveting that eyepatch (Gabrielle, ever the style icon), it's her mini skirt by Kristian Aadnevik that's really caught our attention.
So short we can almost see what Madonna had for breakfast, we're loving the wrap detail and leather ruffles.
Madonna's skirt will be available in boutiques, so why not get into the groove with our skirt edit below.
