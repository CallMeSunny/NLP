 The farmer had hoped that by concealing the house at Honeycrock Farm he could exploit a loophole that meant if a construction was uncontested for four years, authorities could not touch it.The main features of the four-bedroom property include a stained-glass dome above the stairwell, weathered brick and stone, cannons, battlements, carved wooden pillars and wooden beams. It is believed it would be worth £1million without the legal case hanging over it.         Secret castle: Robert Fidler, 67, built his dream mock-Tudor home on green belt land in Salfords, Surrey, and hid it from town planners behind hay bales and a huge tarpaulin         Man at work: Mr Fidler is seen, drill in hand, as he works on the roof of the property where his family have lived since 2002Mr Fidler, who has 11 grandchildren, started as a tenant farmer at Honeycrock Farm in the 1970s and bought the farmyard and ten acres of land in 1985.Howeverm there was no farmhouse so from 2000 he began building the house around two grain silos at a cost of £50,000.Mr Fidler, who has compared his creation to the work of Picasso, had argued that the reason he built the property was because planning authority in Surrey failed to acknowledge an application to convert an existing property for nine years.His family moved into the home in 2002 but it was later discovered by Reigate and Banstead Borough Council, which ordered its demolition in 2007.           Plan: The farmer had hoped that by concealing the house at Honeycrock Farm he could exploit a loophole that meant if a construction was uncontested for four years, authorities could not touch it         Home: Mr Fidler's family moved into the home in 2002 but it was later discovered by Reigate and Banstead Borough Council, which ordered its demolition in 2007The Planning Inspectorate dismissed his appeals, but in November 2014 he was granted temporary planning permission for a maximum of three years. However, former Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles later withdrew this.He had later tried to argue against a court injunction ordering the property's demolition, claiming he would be breaking European laws by knocking down the house without establishing the potential impact on 'roosting' bats currently living at the property. He also said he had found protected and newts living on the premises.And he also claimed that he was no longer the owner of the property, having sold it to a buyer earlier this year who granted him temporary 'asylum'.         Couple: Mr Fidler with his wife Linda. It is believed their home would be worth £1million without the legal case hanging over it         Order: In November, Mr Fidler was told by High Court judge Mr Justice Dove that he could face a three-month prison sentence for his 'intentional defiance' unless he pulls it down by June 6 of this year         Features: The main features of the four-bedroom property include a stained-glass dome above the stairwell, cannons, battlements and wooden beamsHowever, in November he was told by High Court judge Mr Justice Dove that he could face a three-month prison sentence for his 'intentional defiance' unless he pulls it down by June 6 of this year.After listening to the case, the judge had said Mr Fidler was an 'intelligent and determined' man, but said that intelligence and determination had led him to his 'intentional defiance' of the orders of the court. ROBERT FIDLER'S PLANNING WOES June 2002: Robert Fidler secretly builds his £1m home and hides it behind a large bale of hay.2006: Fidler removes the bales, uncovering his home, believing he can exploit a planning loophole and seeks retrospective planning permission2007: Reigate and Banstead Borough Council order him to demolish the house.February 2010: Fidler loses his first High Court appeal against the council’s decisionFebruary 2013: The Planning Inspectorate ruled that Fidler should demolish his homeNovember 2014: Fidler appeals again claiming he keeps his cows on the land and needs to live nearby.April 2015: Fidler loses his latest appeal and is ordered to knock down his house within 90 days.June 2015: Fidler claims he can no longer demolish the house because he has sold it.November 2015: A judge rejects his appeal, and hands Fidler a three-month prison sentence for failing to comply with a court order to tear the property down. It was suspended, on the condition the property is no longer standing by June 6. March 2016: Fidler is seen on the roof of the home as demolition work begins.   He was satisfied that there had been 11 intentional breaches which deserved a prison sentence of three months.But bearing in mind the objective was to get the property demolished for breaking planning laws, he said he would suspend the sentence until June next year to give him time.He made it clear that if the property was still standing in seven months' time, he would not only jail Mr Fidler for three months but also consider a further sentence for his further contempt.He also ordered the farmer to pay the council's legal costs, estimated in the region of £50,000.The judge rejected the application by Mr Fidler to vary the order pending further applications to build somewhere on the farm for him to live in, despite his claims he needs to live on the farm to look after his herd of 120 cattle and was in a 'desperate situation.' The council has said the case had so far cost £50,000 to take through the legal process but said it had to take Mr Fidler to court after he refused to comply with court orders and an injunction.  Last month it was revealed that Mr Fidler was in hot water again with the council, after he applied for permission to transform the secret castle into a two-bedroom bungalow - but planners refused to even consider the application.Mr Fidler claims he's submitted more than 40 planning applications to the council in the nine-year battle over the property.  'It cost me a great deal of money to do all the due things,' he said after the latest application was thrown out. 'We offered to take the top off on the house and turn it into a bungalow or perhaps a cottage, something they would be happy with.'Even with the depths they have stooped to, I'm shocked that they have done that. I don't understand why they have done it. But as far as I'm concerned I don't see there's any point in arguing.'                 Row: Mr Fidler had argued that the reason he built the property in 2000 was because planning authority in Surrey failed to acknowledge an application to convert an existing property for nine years
