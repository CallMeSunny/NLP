Look incredible in a sports luxe bralet like Iggy



The New Classic Neon Orange Sports Bra
Made especially for Iggy!



She may have become a global superstar in the past year, but rapper Iggy Azalea still isn’t into Fancy stage outfits if her sporty ensemble for NBC’s Today Show was anything to go by.
The flaxen-haired songstress showcased her famous voluptuous physique in an eye-popping orange neon and pink sports outfit emblazoned with her titled album ‘The New Classic.’ It’s so bright it’s making us Bounce off the walls!
Iggy kept the rest of her outfit simple with black ankle boots, although we reckon trainers would have sufficed (she didn’t want to be too casual, you know) and finished off the stage look with a slick of bright pink matte lippy. 
Unfortunately, Iggy’s vivacious sports luxe inspired outfit is unable to buy since it was custom made for her, but we’ve had a gander at the best orange crop tops on the market to steal her style. We’re particularly loving Fashion Union’s £14.99 top which ticks two trends in one with its grid print and cropped design, as well as New Look’s rather sexy £6.99 cross over alternative.
