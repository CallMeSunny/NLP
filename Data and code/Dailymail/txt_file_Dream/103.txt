India blames China for stalled nuclear group entry By Afp   Published: 08:13 BST, 25 June 2016  |  Updated: 08:13 BST, 25 June 2016                e-mail         India has blamed regional rival China for blocking its entry to a nuclear trade group opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, after its members met in South Korea with no decision on India's bid to join.India wants to become a member of the 48-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) which works to prevent the sharing of technology that could spread nuclear weapons.New Delhi believes joining the NSG, which concluded a two-day meeting in Seoul Friday, would give it better access to low-cost, clean nuclear energy, important for economic growth.
