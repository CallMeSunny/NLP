Image of Asia: Feeding quake survivors in China By Associated Press   Published: 12:14 BST, 6 August 2014  |  Updated: 12:14 BST, 6 August 2014                e-mail         In this photo by Andy Wong, a woman feeds instant noodles to children outside a tent set up for earthquake survivors in Ludian county of southwest China's Yunnan province. Many of the homes in the hard-hit county, which has a population of about 429,000, were rudimentary mud-brick structures that collapsed easily in the quake. Sunday's 6.1-magnitude temblor in the mountainous farming region was the country's deadliest temblor in four years and its biggest test of emergency response under leader Xi Jinping.___AP photographers on Twitter: http://apne.ws/1ox8vgG        A woman feeds instant noodle to the children outside a temporary tent set up for the earthquake survivors in the town of Longtoushan in Ludian County in southwest China's Yunnan Province Wednesday, Aug. 6, 2014. Some 10,000 troops and hundreds of volunteers have rushed to Ludian to clear roads and dig out survivors from the debris, but landslides and bouts of heavy rains have complicated the efforts.
