President Donald Trump declared his marathon trip to Asia a 'tremendous success' on Wednesday in surprise remarks from the White House that he interrupted twice to take a swig of water.Trump had to break away from his remarks completely to search for a refreshment when he realized a glass had not been set out for him under the podium by staff. The president was just hitting his stride after opening remarks on 'America's renewed confidence and standing in the world' since he took office.Bragging about the 'great respect' the United States is getting across the globe, Trump said the United States 'has never been stronger than it is right now.'Trump was boasting about the lucrative deals he'd secured for the United States in Japan and South Korea when he had to pause for water. He recovered, laying into 'the evil crimes' of 'nuclear menace' North Korea before he was foiled by dry mouth again.'America is back. And the future has never looked brighter,' Trump said in his big finish.         President Donald Trump declared his marathon trip to Asia a 'tremendous success' on Wednesday in surprise remarks from the White House that he interrupted twice to take a swig of waterTrump was thought to be in recuperation after his 12-day blitz of Asia. His public schedule on Wednesday was a blank slate.The White House added the speech to his schedule late in the day after Trump started fuming on Twitter about the coverage of his trip to the Far East.In a rehash of his foreign travels since May, Trump proudly declared that his just-concluded tour 'was the longest visit to the region by an American president in more than a quarter of a century.''Everywhere we went, our foreign hosts greeted the American delegation, myself included, with incredible warmth, hospitality and, most importantly, respect,' Trump said. 'When we are confident in ourselves, our strength, our flag, our history, our values, other nations are confident in us. 'And when we treat our citizens with the respect they deserve, other countries treat America with the respect that our country so richly deserves.'Trump harped that he'd 'inherited' a 'series of growing dangers' and 'challenges' that included 'rogue regimes pursuing deadly weapons, foreign powers challenging America's influence, the spread of the murderous terror group ISIS and years of unfair trade practices. 'These products really showed what previous mistakes were made over many years and even decades by other administrations,' he said. 'Some of these mistakes were born of indifference and neglect. Others from naive thinking and misguided judgment. In some cases, the negative influence of partisan politics and special interests was to blame.'          Trump was boasting about the lucrative deals he'd secured for the United States in Japan and South Korea when he had to pause for water. He recovered, laying 'the evil crimes' of 'nuclear menace' North Korean before he was foiled by dry mouth again       Tweaking his predecessors, Republican and Democrat, Trump said the 'common thread' that intertwined their stained legacies 'was a failure to protect and promote the interest of the American people and American workers.''With this goal in mind, I vowed that we would reaffirm old alliances, and form new friendships in pursuit of shared goals,' the president said.Trump set off into a detailed description of his four trips abroad and the achievements of his short presidency. 'I urged our NATO allies to do more to strengthen our crucial alliance, and set the stage for significant increases in member contributions,' Trump said of a trip to Brussels. 'Billions and billions of dollars are pouring in because of that initiative. NATO, believe me, is very happy with Donald Trump and what I did.'In Asia, Trump said he united the region 'against the nuclear menace posed by the North Korean regime - a threat that has increased steadily, through many administrations, and now requires urgent action.'On the topic of trade, Trump said he passed around an 'open invitation to every country that seeks to do business with the United States' and a 'firm warning to every country that cheats, breaks the rules and engages in economic aggression.''That is why we have almost an $800 billion a year trade deficit with other nations. Unacceptable,' Trump said. 'We are going to start whittling that down and as fast as possible.'         Trump was thought to be in recuperation after his 12-day blitz of Asia. His public schedule on Wednesday was a blank slate. The White House added the speech to his schedule late in the day after Trump started fuming on Twitter about the coverage of his trip to the Far EastThe president said his talks abroad included a 'candid conversation' with Chinese leader Xi Jinping about the country's gaping trade deficit with the United States.'We can no longer tolerate unfair trading practices that steal American jobs, wealth and intellectual property,' Trump says he told Xi. 'The days of the United States being taken advantage of are over.' Trump landed in Washington yesterday evening after a day spent flying from one end of the International Date Line to the other.A White House official said Trump spent his morning talking to lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, and he was expected to make additional calls later in the day.Trump is headed to Capitol Hill tomorrow to deliver remarks to House Republicans. The official said Trump would 'give them a brief update on his trip and also encourage that this is a once-in-30-year opportunity' to pass tax reform.  But Trump grew restless midway through the day and lit into the New York Times after it published a piece boiling down his accomplishments, in his own words, to the 'relationship' he now has with Pacific Rim leaders, like Xi and Vladimir Putin.'They should realize that these relationships are a good thing, not a bad thing. The U.S. is being respected again. Watch Trade!' Trump tweeted.         President Donald Trump boasted Wednesday that he has a 'great relationship' with China's Xi Jinping as he furiously refuted an article that was critical of his trip to Asia         Trump lit into the New York Times after it published a piece boiling down his accomplishments, in his own words, to the 'relationship' he now has with Pacific Rim leaders, like Xi and Vladimir Putin         Trump mentioned trade in an apparent reference to the scrutiny he has received for his empty-handed return from ChinaTrump said Friday during a flight from Beijing to Da Nang, Vietnam, that he had a long talk with Xi in which he told the foreign leader he'd like to him him 'ratchet it up' on North Korea. 'I think he's doing that,' the U.S. president said.'We were together for hours. And we get along very well,' Trump told journalists. 'And we talked a lot about North Korea. We talked about a lot of things. We talked a lot about North Korea.'  In tweets on Wednesday prior to the schedule change, when he had nothing on his public schedule following his 12-day, five-nation feting in East Asia where he was welcomed with red carpet after red carpet, Trump bragged about his foreign policy acumen.He mentioned trade specifically in an apparent reference to the scrutiny he has received for his empty-handed return from China.Trump secured $250 billion in tentative agreements for U.S. companies - but the contracts were paper thin. Assertions that South Korea and Vietnam are on the verge of purchasing massive amounts of U.S. military equipment were also yet to materialize. Hours after he arrived in Beijing, Trump was raving about the grandiose welcome ceremony and the exclusive tour of the Forbidden City that Xi put on for him.He told business leaders during a signing ceremony that he does not blame China - a country he once accused of 'raping' the U.S. economy - for taking advantage of past administrations' incompetency.         Shortly before the tirade, China said it would deploy a special envoy to North Korea a week to the day after the visit to Beijing that Trumps is calling a bonanza. It's the first time in two years that Chinese representation will be in Pyongyang         Chinese President Xi Jinping (L) holds a grand ceremony to welcome U.S. President Donald Trump at the square outside the east gate of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China         Trump said Friday during a flight from Beijing to Da Nang, Vietnam, that he had a long talk with Xi in which he told the foreign leader he'd like to him him 'ratchet it up' on North Korea. 'I think he's doing that,' the U.S. president said         Hours after he arrived in Beijing, Trump was raving about the grandiose welcome ceremony and the exclusive tour of the Forbidden City that Xi put on for him       'We have an amazing feeling toward each other. And he's for China; I'm for USA. You know, it's one of those things. But we have a great feeling,' he said of Xi as he traveled from Beijing to Vietnam.Trump said then that he spoke to Xi about China's intellectual property theft, which the president acknowledged has a price tag of about about $300 billion a year.'We talked about it. But I said, we're friends, but this is a different administration than you've had for the last 30 years,' he said, bringing South Korea and Japan's trade deficits into the discussion. 'And I don't blame any of those countries. I blame the people that we had representing us who didn't know what they were doing. Because they should have never let it happen.'Trump's stunning about-face on Chinese railroading of U.S. businesses was just the beginning.He revealed during the same talk with reporters that he thinks Putin is sincere when he says he does not have knowledge of the Kremlin's election meddling and does not believe it happened.       If it weren't for the allegations of collusion between his campaign and Russia, Trump said he and Putin would have continued to develop 'a very good feeling for each other.'Trump also said the United States' relationship with the Philippines is 'better than ever' after a meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte. The foreign government says Trump did not press Duterte on human rights during their talk and the country's reported extrajudicial killings.'I've made a lot of friends at the highest level, whether it's China and the incredible opening they gave us -- that unbelievable evening. People really have never seen anything like it -- going to the Forbidden City and a theater that hadn't been open in over 100 years, and the level of talent that we watched. It was really something special,' Trump said as he was leaving the Philippines.He told reporters on the flight back to Washington that he'd had a 'great trip' and he'd 'done a really fantastic job.''It's also been really good, in terms of North Korea and getting everybody together. I think their acts are all together. China has been excellent,' Trump said.       Trump said that Xi committed 'to stopping the nuclearization of North Korea.''That's a big statement. He made that statement, and a lot of people didn't -- they didn't pick that up,' Trump assessed. 'I said, wow, that's a big statement.'   In Beijing, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson insisted 'there's no space' between the United States' and China's 'objectives' in North Korea.'President Trump, our President, has been very clear with President Xi that he takes the view that you are a very powerful neighbor of theirs; you account for 90-plus percent of their economic activity; you're a strong man -- you can, I'm sure, solve this for me,' Tillerson said. 'And so he was very clear with him and said he believes it can be solved.'Trump said Wednesday in his remarks from the White House that he 'made historic strides in reasserting American leadership, restoring American security and reawakening American confidence' during his trip. 'As long as we are true to ourselves, faithful to our founding and loyal to our citizens, then there is no task too great, no dream too large, no goal beyond our reach,' Trump said.
