 Just like a mirror to the Xi-Kim meetings held in China this week and in March, the fathers of the two country's current leaders sat side by side, showing their bond of Communist brotherhood.They were listening to the future Chinese first lady Peng Liyuan, then merely 20 years old, singing North Korean folk song 'flower-selling girl' in Mandarin and Korean.The video was filmed during Kim Jong-il's first visit to China in June, 1983. Xi Zhongxun, said to be good friends with Kim Jong-il, was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China. The war veteran, then 69 years old, was among a number of top Chinese leaders to receive Kim Jong-il, then 42 years old.              Kim Jong-un (left) became the North Korean leader after Kim Jong-ill (right) died in 2011              Xi Jinping (left), son of Chinese veteran Xi Zhongxun (right), became China's leader in 2012         Kim Jong-un and Xi Jinping meet for the second time in two months in the city of Dalian, ChinaKim Jong-il visited China as the heir apparent of North Korea to succeed his father Kim Il-sung, the founder of North Korea. He was also the general secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea.His 1983 visit was unofficial and never reported in China, but its details - including the clip of the song - were revealed in a North Korean documentary, lengthily named 'Leader of the Workers' Party of Korea and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party Comrade Kim Jong-il's visit to China'.The 90-minute propaganda film shows Kim Jong-il travelling from North Korea to China's border city Dandong on a green train - just like what his son did in March, which earned Kim junior his latest nickname 'fatty on the train' in China.It's said that Kim Jong-il had such a fear of flying that he visited China and Russia in a private armoured train.Unveiled in 1962 with its first flight the following year, the IL-62 became commonly used around the world and continued being manufactured until 1994. From Dandong, Kim Jong-il carried on his 1983 journey by train to China's capital city Beijing where he was received by Xi Zhongxun as well as Hu Yaobang, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China.The Chinese leaders showed great hospitality to Kim Jong-il, taking him to the ancient imperial palace, driving him around in symbolic Red Flag limousines and treating him to lavish banquets.Peng was one of the performances at an entertainment gala Beijing set up to welcome Kim Jong-il. Back then, Xi Jinping and Peng Liyuan were yet to be introduced to each other. The two, one successful politician and one popular singer, started dating in 1986 and got married in 1987.          Peng Liyuan (circled) was among a number of artists performing for Kim Jong-il in 1983              Peng Liyuan (pictured), China's first lady, is a popular singer and once an entertainment soldierFrom Beijing, the North Korean leader travelled southwards to coastal city Qingdao where he visited the famous Tsingtao Beer factory; ancient capital Nanjing where he climbed onto the monumental Yangtze River bridge; and scenic Hangzhou where he took a boat journey on West Lake, as the film shows.He then made a stop in commercial hub Shanghai, where visited the birthplace of the Communist Party of China.From Shanghai, Kim travelled back to capital Beijing to hold a meeting with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who was the Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Central Military Commission.In the years to follow, Kim Jong-il paid seven official state visits to China from 2000 to 2011, all of which were conducted after his father's death.   But it was his first unofficial visit in 1983 that carried the most surreal connection to the Beijing-Pyongyang relation today.          Xi Jinping and Peng Liyuan arrive for a concert held for G20 leaders in Hamburg in July, 2017         Xi Jinping and Peng Liyuan meet Catherine Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William in 2015Kim Jong-un, who's the spitting image of his late father, visited China for the first time in March this year by train, which was also his first overseas state visit since taking the office in 2011.In Beijing he met with China's president Xi Jinping, Xi Zhongxun's son, and China's first lady, Peng Li Yuan, who sang for his late father more than three decades ago.A bit over a month later earlier this week, Kim Jong-un travelled to China again - but this time on his private jet - for a surprise visit to meet President Xi Jinping just weeks ahead of the North Korean dictator's planned summit with Donald Trump.The pictures of Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un taking a stroll side by side and sitting next to each other during a meeting echoed what their fathers did in 1983 in an interesting and surreal manner. Why is Kim Jong-un called 'Kim Fatty III' in China?  There are several different theories on the origin of the nickname.  Here are the two popular ones according to Chinese media.The first one deprives from the three-generation lineage of North Korean leadership. Apparently all of the three leaders on North Korea's history are deemed 'fat' by Chinese people. Kim Il-sung, the founder of the communist country, is called 'Kim Fatty I'. His son, Kim Jong-il, is 'Kim Fatty II' while Kim Jong-un is 'Kim Fatty III'.The second theory says because Kim Jong-un is the third son of Kim Jong-il and he is fat, he is called 'Kim Fatty III".                     Kim Jong-un attends a meeting with Xi Jinping in Dalian during Kim's second visit to China         The two leaders take a seaside stroll during their two-day meeting in the coastal city of Dalian
