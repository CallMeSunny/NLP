China is already a major buyer of exports such as copper from Chile, the world's biggest producer of the metal.

The two countries agreed on the move during a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Chile last year. Latin American countries are concerned about the impact Trump's trade policies will have on their economies. The US president has threatened to put up barriers to international trade to protect US jobs. Chile supports the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a major trade agreement that has collapsed due to Trump's opposition. China is its biggest trade partner, receiving about a quarter of all Chilean exports.
