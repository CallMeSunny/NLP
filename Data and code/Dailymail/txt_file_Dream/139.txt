China's Xi revives Long March myths to rally Communist Party By Afp   Published: 10:37 BST, 18 October 2016  |  Updated: 10:38 BST, 18 October 2016                e-mail         As China marks 80 years since the Red Army ended its epic Long March, the Communist Party is attacking revisionist history in an effort to compel reverence for its founding legend.Facing annihilation at the hands of Nationalists during China's civil war in 1934, 80,000 Communist soldiers and leaders -- Mao Zedong among them -- broke through encircling forces and embarked on a gruelling escape.Nine out of 10 had deserted or died by the time the last units reached Yanan in the northern province of Shaanxi as much as two years later, where Mao and his cohorts founded a base from which they went on to take over the country.

As ordinary people, we cannot tell whether history is true. But we can still learn from the spirit of the Long March.”        A poem by Mao Zedong is displayed at the National Museum in Beijing as part of an exhibition to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the Red Army's Long March ©Fred Dufour (AFP)         Mao Zedong on October 1, 1949, declared the foundation of the People's Republic of China in Beijing's Tiananmen Square         China's National Museum in Beijing is hosting an exhibition to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the Red Army's Long March ©Fred Dufour (AFP)         Speculation is mounting that Chinese President Xi Jinping may delay appointing a successor and seek to stay in power beyond the traditional 10-year term ©Lintao Zhang (Pool/AFP/File)         China is marking 80 years since the Red Army ended its epic Long March
