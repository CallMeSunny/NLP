Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017  Last week, the president predicted in a tweet that his meeting with Mr Xi would be “very difficult”.The White House has downplayed expectations for a breakthrough on issues such as trade and tariffs, insisting that the 24-hour summit is mostly an introductory meeting for the two leaders.Within Mr Trump’s administration, there are still divisions over how to approach China.According to US and foreign officials, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and economic adviser Gary Cohn are leading the charge for boosting bilateral relations with China and exploring the potential for greater economic cooperation.But economic adviser Peter Navarro, author of the book Death By China: Confronting The Dragon – A Global Call To Action, prefers trying to isolate China, in keeping with Mr Trump’s America First mantra.
