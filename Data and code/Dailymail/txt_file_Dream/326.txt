 BEIJING, June 27 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping told visiting U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday that if their two countries are able to develop a good relationship, it will benefit peace, stability and prosperity globally. "The China-U.S. relationship is one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world," Xi said, as they met in Beijing's Great Hall of the People. In recent years, China-U.S. military ties have maintained a good momentum and China hopes this can continue, Xi added. (Reporting by Phil Stewart Writing by Ben Blanchard)
