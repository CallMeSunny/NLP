The newest addition to China's air force, the J-20 stealth fighter, will make its first public flight this week.But the fighter jet’s first outing could be controversial, with previous reports claiming the J-20's design comes from stolen plans obtained by hackers.The claims have been firmly denied by the Chinese.Scroll down for video         China's new stealth fighter jet, the J-20 (pictured), is the country's first radar-evading combat aircraft and will make its first public appearance at an airshow in Zhuhai this weekEarlier this year, a Chinese national, 51-year-old Su Bin, was sent to prison for his part in stealing US military plans and sending documents to Beijing.The documents were reported to include plans for the F-35 and F-22 fighter jets, which would have enabled the Chinese military to rapidly catch up with US capabilities.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       SpaceX aims to launch again this year: Says helium tanks may...

 The new Chinese war plane will take to the skies during the Zhuhai Air Show, its manufacturer announced today, as Beijing flexes its long-range military muscles.  The J-20, 'which military enthusiasts at home and abroad have watched closely', will make its first public flight demonstration, said Tan Ruisong, the president of China's state aerospace company AVIC.              Previous reports have claimed the J-20's design comes from stolen plans obtained by hackers of the F-22 (pictured left) and F-35 Raptors (pictured right)China trailed the world in aerospace technology 20 years ago, he told a press conference, but is now at the leading edge.Swift, stealthy, and armed with long-range missiles, the new J-20s represent a leap forward in China's ability to project power in Asia and compete in capabilities with the United States.Beijing is seeking to modernise and upgrade its military both to protect its borders and project power into regions such as the South China Sea, a resource-rich waterway where it has disputes with several neighbours.         The air show will showcase China's aerial strength. Along with the latest J-20 stealth jet will be the seven-strong J-10 fighter jets of China's Bayi Aerobatic Team (pictured)  THE J-20 STEALTH FIGHTER    China's new war plane is swift, stealthy, and armed with long-range missiles.Experts say the plane represents a leap forward in China's ability to project power in Asia, and will compete with US military technology.The stealth fighter will be showcased at China's airshow in Guandong this week (1-6 November).Beijing is looking to upgrade its military as part of efforts to strengthen its borders and exert more control over disputed territories.   China's only international aerospace exhibition, held biennially in the southern city of Zhuhai, this year boasts its largest-ever display of military hardware and aircraft, with 11 exhibition halls, 430,000 square metres of indoor and outdoor viewing area, and 151 aircraft from 700 exhibitors from 42 countries and regions.The show will also see the debut of the Y-20 transport aircraft, which can move heavy loads and carry out airlifts to assist military activities.Chinese-made military assault vehicles, anti-aircraft missile systems, drones and fighter jets stood on display outside the exhibition centre.AVIC chief Tan said his company had business in 80 countries and territories, with annual overseas sales exceeding 80 billion yuan ($11.8bn / £9.7bn).The firm will firmly remember its 'sacred mission' to serve China, he said. It would carry out the strategic plan of the Communist party, the government and the People's Liberation Army and 'closely unite around the core leadership of comrade Xi Jinping'.AVIC, which earlier this year acquired British cabin interior supplier AIM Altitude, would 'persistently struggle' to realise the dream of a great Chinese air force and a strong military, he added.         The airshow, in Zhuhai, south China's Guangdong Province, will provide a platform for Beijing to flex its long-range military muscle to the public and watching nations around the world.

It was also reported in September that a Chinese firm claimed to have developed radar technology capable of detecting stealth jets (stock image used)       The leaked images revealed the battle ship's progress, with signs of portals on the stern for sensors and weapons and up to 128 vertical launch system cells for missiles.It was also reported in September that a Chinese firm claimed to have developed radar technology capable of detecting stealth jets.Called the quantum radar, the technology was reportedly created by Intelligent Perception Technology, a branch of defence and electronics firm CETC.They firm claims it is capable of detecting a target at a range of 60 miles and was successfully tested last month.China has pushed for dominance in the South China Sea, following a number of contentious claims over who owns territory in the region. The two major island chains in the region, the Spratlys and the Paracels, have become central to the international argument, causing tensions to rise.Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines all have claims on the region, but China has surged ahead with expansive military operations, including the building of its own islands in disputed spots to stake its claim and bolster a military presence. CHINA'S WARSHIP TO BE A 'GAME CHANGER'           Asia's most powerful warship has been shrouded in mystery since construction began last year at the Jiangnan Changxing shipyards. Called Type 005 destroyer, this vessel is said to be armed with electromagnetic railguns that can shoot down missiles and attack land targets (pictured is an artist impression of Type 005)Leaked images show the Type 005 destroyer should launch late 2017 or early 2018.It has a full displacement of over 14,000 tons.And the images show the bow and stern are finished.         Now, leaked images give a glimpse of the battle ship's progress, which reveals four portals on the stern for sensors and weapons and up to 128 vertical launch system cells for missiles (pictured is an artist impression of Type 005)The bow area appears to be extremely hydrodynamic hull, endure high speeds, have stealth capabilities and is fitted with an enclosed deck.And the stern is where the creators packed all of the technology.This area has at least four sections that hold sensors and weapons like towed array sonar, variable depth sonar, towed torpedo decoys and active torpedo defenses.Because the ship is 175 meters long and is built with large displacement, the Type 005 will be capable of carry numerous helicopters at once and other technologies such as drones and underwater vehicles.
