 BEIJING, April 26 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday called for concrete efforts to maintain financial security, the official Xinhua news agency said. Xinhua said Xi made the remarks at a group study session for members of the politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party. Xi's remarks follow a series of measures to more closely regulate the banking and insurance sectors amid concerns of rising risks in the shadow banking industry.
