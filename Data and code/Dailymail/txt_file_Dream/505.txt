Don't take China for granted: ambassador By Australian Associated Press   Published: 07:29 BST, 26 June 2014  |  Updated: 07:29 BST, 26 June 2014                e-mail         Chinese investor interest in Australia is growing but our ambassador to China is urging government and business not to take the relationship for granted.Frances Adamson says Chinese investors are aware of opposition to foreign investment from some Australians but are increasingly interested in the great southern land.Ms Adamson told a Sydney audience she thought the Australian public's attitude towards Chinese investment was beginning to change."What I hear increasingly ... is the supporters of Chinese investment ... more willing to put up their hand and say so," she said at an Asialink luncheon on Thursday.She said Chinese trade had brought "real prosperity to Australian households" but the nation shouldn't become complacent."Australia must compete with other countries to attract Chinese investment," she said.Prime Minister Tony Abbott led a party of federal ministers, state premiers and a 700-strong business delegation to China in April.Ambassador Adamson called the trip a success and said the Abbott-Jinping (Xi Jinping, Chinese president) relationship had got off to a good start."It was clear the leaders were very much comfortable in each other's company," she said.
