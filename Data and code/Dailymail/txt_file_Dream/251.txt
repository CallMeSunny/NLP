The Gujarat BJP unit is gearing up to celebrate the 64th birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will visit the state on September 16 and 17. This is Modi’s first visit to the home state after he was sworn in as the PM in May. Modi, sources said, will celebrate his birthday on September 17 along with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Sources close to the PM said he would visit his brother Pankaj’s house in Gandhinagar to seek his mother Hira Ba’s blessings. Every year, Modi meets his mother on his birthday.          PM Narendra Modi meets his mother on his birthday every year.During his visit to Gujarat, Jinping will ink a pact with the state government to develop 10-sq-km industrial park in Sanand, around 70km from Ahmedabad. Coincidently, the by-poll results of the nine Assembly seats and Vadodara Lok Sabha constituency will be declared on September 16, a day before the PM’s birthday. Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel has urged voters and BJP workers to gift Modi by electing the party candidates in all 10 Assembly constituencies. Anticipating victory in all the Assembly segments, the saffron party has planned a grand celebration on September 16. Referring to the visit of Modi and Jinping, Patel said it was fortunate for the state that the two most powerful political leaders of Asia would be together in its soil. “During the Congress rule, chief ministers used to visit Delhi and they were given little importance. Now the time has changed. Not only Indian Prime Minister but even Chinese president is visiting the state,” she said. The upcoming industrial park in Sanand is expected to attract investments worth $1billion, said sources in state department for industries. Sources said the integrated industrial park would have all facilities ranging from residences, recreational centres, hotels, schools, restaurants, banks and sports complexes.
