 WASHINGTON, May 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday to discuss trade and North Korea, following last week's U.S.-China trade meeting and amid efforts to address Pyongyang's weapons programs. "I will be speaking to my friend, President Xi of China, this morning at 8:30. The primary topics will be Trade, where good things will happen, and North Korea, where relationships and trust are building," Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.
