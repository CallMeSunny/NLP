 Two giant pandas have received a celebrity welcome in Berlin from the mayor and Chinese ambassador after they weathered a long flight from China. Meng Meng and Jiao Qing flew the animal equivalent of first class on their 12-hour flight from Chengdu in south-west China to the German capital. Their entourage included a Berlin vet, two Chinese zookeepers and a group of journalists.

Medication for motion sickness was not needed. “They did just fine,” he said. The German capital is going wild over the impossibly cute bears, who will be presented to the public at Berlin Zoo on July 6.

Female Meng Meng, which translates as “sweet dream”, is three years old and weighs 77kg. The pandas were taken from the airport to the zoo with police protection so they did not have to stop at any red lights.

Once they have chewed up all of that, the zoo will start importing special bamboo from the Netherlands. The furry couple will move into a ritzy new nine million euro (£8 million) compound, complete with Chinese-style pavilions, red lanterns, a climbing area and a mountain landscape. They will be the only pandas in the country, the German news agency dpa reported. Expectations are high the two will reproduce soon, though Mr Ochs warned that Meng Meng is not mature enough yet.

Berlin’s last panda, Bao Bao, was sent in 1980 as a gift from then-Chinese leader Hua Guofeng to West German chancellor Helmut Schmidt. Bao Bao died in 2012. Berlin’s most famous zoo animal, the polar bear Knut, died of a sudden illness in 2011.
