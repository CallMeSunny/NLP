 WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow blamed Chinese President Xi Jinping for a lack of progress over U.S-China trade talks, and warned that U.S. President Donald Trump was "not going to let go" of the issue, Axios reported on Friday. "The problem here is Xi. He doesn´t want to move, and they´ve offered the U.S. absolutely ... no options regarding the issue of (intellectual property) theft and forced technology transfer," Kudlow said in an interview with the news outlet.
