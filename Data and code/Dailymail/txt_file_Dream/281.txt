BEIJING (AP) - Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Norway's prime minister on Monday as the two countries sought to move beyond a six-year rift following the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to an imprisoned Chinese dissident.Meeting in Beijing, Xi commended Prime Minister Erna Solberg for her "hard work" in helping normalize ties between the countries. It was the first visit from a Norwegian prime minister to China in 10 years."Your visit this time holds a lot of significance," Xi said. "This is the first high-level visit since the normalization of China-Norway relations in December."

He recalled visiting Norway on an official trip 38 years ago as a secretary to former Vice Premier Geng Biao and said the trip had left a deep impression on him.Solberg said she appreciated the Chinese government's hospitality during a visit that began Friday. She added that Norway's King Harald V was planning a state visit to China next year after receiving an invitation from Xi.
