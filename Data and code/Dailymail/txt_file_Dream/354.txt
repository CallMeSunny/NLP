 WASHINGTON, April 25 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he will soon host Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the White House, setting the stage for a possible agreement on trade between the world's two largest economies. The White House said on Tuesday that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will travel to Beijing for additional talks on a trade dispute that has led to tit-for-tat tariffs between the two countries.
