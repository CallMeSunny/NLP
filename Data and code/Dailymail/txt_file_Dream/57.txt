Commons Speaker John Bercow today took a swipe at the Chinese president as he introduced him to the House of Commons by praising pro-democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi.Addressing the house before inviting President Xi Jinping to speak, Mr Bercow pointedly described Burma's Ms Suu Kyi, who recently addressed both Houses of Parliament, as the 'champion of democracy'.In what appeared to be a veiled reference to Beijing's poor human rights record, he added that China should aspire to be seen as a 'moral inspiration' to the world as it takes its place as an international superpower.The Commons Speaker, who was introducing President Xi ahead of the Chinese leader's address to MPs and peers, said 'the world will be watching' the Asian nation's progress.          Mr Bercow's comments came after what was seen as a dig at the Chinese premier earlier today at the very moment the Queen was welcoming the Chinese President to LondonHe said: 'Welcome to the Royal Gallery. Mr President. We have had no fewer than four prominent daughters and sons of Asia in our Parliament in the last three years, starting with Aung Sang Suu Kyi of Burma – the Nobel peace prize winner, democracy champion and international symbol of the innate human right of freedom.'Your visit here today, Mr President, reinforces the links between the United Kingdom and China. Those links are social and personal as well as economic and political and all the stronger for that.' 'This trip should provide the means for both sides to understand each other better, the Chinese people have many friends in this Parliament. Those friends are familiar with what you, Mr President, have described as the Chinese dream and what many others have referred to as a second Chinese revolution.'

 Mr Bercow's speech then took a more flattering tone towards China as he praised the country's economic power and technological advances.  He continued: 'Your country is engaged in an experience and an experiment without equal in history. You are attempting to complete an industrial revolution which took Britain the best part of two centuries in little more than two decades.'Your country has seen a transformation in how its people work and in what they rightly expect for themselves, for their families and for their society.         Addressing the house before inviting President Xi Jinping to speak, Mr Bercow pointedly described Burma's Ms Suu Kyi, who recently addressed both Houses of Parliament, as the 'champion of democracy'                  Twitter users who watched Mr Bercow's speech speculated that David Cameron may not have been happy with the Speaker's introduction of President Xi'The enormous challenge of how to deal with this, falls to you and your colleagues. Yet what China does economically, but also politically, is seen by and relevant to not merely your own citizens, it is seen by and relevant to billions more across the globe.'The world will be watching and waiting expectantly on the outcome as the emerging superpower takes its new place in the world.'    AUNG SAN SUU KYI: THE LADY OF BURMA AND WORLDWIDE ICON            Known as the Lady of Burma, 70-year-old Aung San Suu KyiKnown as the Lady of Burma, 70-year-old Aung San Suu Kyi is a democracy campaigner and the opposition leader in Myanmar and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.A military-drafted constitution bars her from becoming president of Burma, but she is one of the most powerful people in the country.Mother-of-two Suu Kyi was imprisoned by the former military dictatorship for 15 years for her attempts to bring down military rule in Myanmar, and became an international symbol of peaceful resistance in the face of oppression.  Addressing the audience in Parliament's Royal Gallery, Mr Bercow referred to 'the wise Chinese words' that 'it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness'.'We very much hope that your time here will assist the process of illumination,' he told Mr Xi.Mr Xi then addressed Parliament in Mandarin, describing Britain and China as becoming 'increasingly interdependent' parts of a 'community of shared interests'.In his 11-minute speech he told assembled peers and MPs that he believed his four-day State visit to the UK was helping to lift the friendly relationship between the two countries to 'a new height'.  Mr Xi said that the experience of giving his address in the historic Parliament gave him 'the feeling of going back in time'.He acknowleged that the British parliament was the oldest in the world, but added: 'In China, the concept of putting people first and following the rule of law emerged in the ancient times.' Lord Speaker Baroness D'Souza told the president that offering an address to both Houses in the Royal Gallery was a 'rare tribute, which we reserve only for those we hold in the highest regard'. Mr Bercow's comments came after what was seen as a dig at the Chinese premier earlier today at the very moment the Queen was welcoming the Chinese President to London.He contrasted the four-day state visit by President Xi with a planned visit by the prime Minister of India, which he described as a 'great democracy'.The extraordinary intervention at a key moment in British-Chinese relations will cause deep embarrassment for the government which hopes to use the visit to secure billions of pounds in trade deals.The visit by President Xi has been dominated by claims the UK government is kowtowing to the Chinese and brushing concerns about human rights, cybersecurity and UK job losses under the red carpet to woo the world's second largest economy.But Mr Bercow's decision to criticise China's communist rule will trigger anger in Downing Street and comes just hours before President Xi is due to address both Houses of Parliament.During Foreign Office questions in the Commons today, Labour MP Keith Vaz asked about a visit to the UK next month by Inidian Prime Minister Narendra Modi which he said is the cause of 'huge excitement amongst the British-Indian community'.He said the visit should be used to 'send out a message that it is not just learning Chinese that is important and that a bit of Hindi will go down well in our bilateral relations'. He has long been an advocate of human rights across all continents and countries  John Bercow's spokesman Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire said he welcomed the visit, including plans for Mr Modi to address a huge event at Wembley Stadium.He added that he wanted to see more English language teaching in India.At this point Mr Bercow stood up and pointedly said: 'Of course the Indian Prime Minister is the representative of a great democracy.'He placed heavy emphasis on 'democracy' before calling the next MP to ask a question.Mr Swire was seen to be visibly irritated by the intervention, and there were audible intakes of breath in the Commons but Mr Bercow continued chatting to his clerks.A spokesman for Mr Bercow said: 'He said what he said.'Asked if the Speaker was pleased the red carpet was being rolled out for the Chinese President, the spokesman said: 'The Speaker frequently welcomes guests to address both Houses, on behalf of his Parliamentary colleagues.'Pressed on whether the comments were fuelled by concern about human rights in China, the spokesman added: 'He has long been an advocate of human rights across all continents and countries.'                As a four-day state visit by President Xi Jinping got underway, Mr Bercow contrasted it with a planned visit by the prime Minister of India which is a 'great democracy'         President Xi was escorted by the Duke of Edinburgh as he passed members of the Household Cavalry at Horse Guards ParadeIn December last year Mr Bercow was critical of the Chinese government after it refused to allow aa committee of MPs to visit Hong Kong.He branded the snub an 'extremely serious matter for which I can think of no exactly comparable precedent in my 17 and a half years in the House'.Before becoming Speaker, the Tory MP asked questions about executions and the use of the death penalty in China.In a debate in 2007, Mr Bercow said: 'If China wants to play a responsible role in the world, it must accept that it is incumbent on it so to behave in the international community as to demonstrate a greater respect for the human rights of other people.'And also an interest in the political and diplomatic priorities of the countries with which it wants both to do business in commercial terms and to establish decent political relations.'Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is expected to challenge President Xi on human rights at a private meeting this afternoon.Mr Cameron's former policy guru Steve Hilton wrote in the Mail today: 'Instead of standing up to a dangerous rogue state, we are bowing down before it.'By embracing the Chinese dictatorship, we bring national and moral dishonour.'
