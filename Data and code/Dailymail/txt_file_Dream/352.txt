 BEIJING, Feb 20 (Reuters) - A Chinese military court sentenced a senior general who had been chief of a top defence department to life in prison on Wednesday after finding him guilt of corruption, state news agency Xinhua reported. Fang Fenghui, who had accompanied President Xi Jinping to his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in 2017, was replaced as chief of the Joint Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army later that year with no explanation. The government later confirmed he was being investigated on suspicion of corruption. (Reporting by Ben Blanchard Editing by Robert Birsel)
