         China’s President Xi Jinping pipped Modi to the 'most popular' crownA global survey conducted across 30 countries measuring the confidence citizens have in their own leaders has found that China’s President Xi Jinping enjoys most domestic support in handling domestic and international affairs, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi coming a close second. The study, which surveyed 26,000 respondents in 30 countries, was conducted by Japanese firm GMO Research, and its findings were published in a research paper released on Thursday by Tony Saich, a professor at Harvard University’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation. Among respondents in each of 10 “key countries”, including India, China, the United States, Russia and Japan, the survey found that on the issue of “domestic confidence” in handling domestic and international affairs, Xi was ranked favourably by 94.8 per cent of Chinese respondents on domestic issues and 93.8 per cent on international affairs. Modi was second, receiving 93.2 per cent domestic confidence on domestic issues and 93.3 per cent on international affairs. He was followed by Russian President Vladimir Putin at 86 per cent on domestic and international affairs – a figure that has likely fallen significantly following Russia’s recent economic meltdown.
