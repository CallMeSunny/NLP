 SEOUL, May 18 (Reuters) - South Korea's foreign ministry said on Thursday preparations have begun for a summit meeting with the United States slated for late June, as both countries aim to strengthen ties in the face of North Korea's weapons development. Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in's envoy for China, Lee Hae-chan, had not met Chinese President Xi Jinping as of 0540 GMT, foreign ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck said in a regular media briefing. Lee left for China early on Thursday. (Reporting by Christine Kim; Editing by Robert Birsel)
