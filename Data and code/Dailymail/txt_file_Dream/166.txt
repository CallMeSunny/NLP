David Cameron (right) was taking no chances on his visit to Manchester City's ground with Chinese president Xi Jinping (left), who both met star striker Sergio Aguero (centre)The paper explained that City had made a good beginning to the season and highlighted Mike Summerbee, City's club ambassador. 'Comment on MCFC's strong start to the Premier League season — they are currently top by two points,' it explained. The briefing also included 'Top 10 things to raise with Xi — conversation starters', although details have not been released.It added: 'President Xi is reported to be a keen football fan in particular and has announced a reform programme designed to realise his dream of seeing China win the World Cup.'The briefing continues: 'This Manchester event should further underline our commitment to work with China to assist them in achieving their desired reform.'I do hope Dave's crib sheet won't prove an own goal.
