Xi offers vision of China-driven 'Asia-Pacific dream' By Afp   Published: 14:54 BST, 9 November 2014  |  Updated: 14:55 BST, 9 November 2014                e-mail         President Xi Jinping offered the world a vision of a Chinese-driven "Asia-Pacific dream" on Sunday, as Beijing hosts a regional gathering that underlines its growing global clout."We have the responsibility to create and realise an Asia-Pacific dream for the people of the region," the Chinese Communist chief told a gathering of business and political leaders that precedes the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' gathering.The 21-member APEC groups 40 percent of the world's population, almost half its trade and more than half its GDP, and the summit will be attended by leaders including US President Barack Obama, his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

But its growth reached a five-year low in the third quarter.Xi said the risks it faced were "not that scary" and slower expansion was expected as its economy matures.China currently suffers from a deflating property bubble, a crackdown on corruption blamed for curbing some business, and weak demand from Europe.Even so it was expected to invest more than $1.25 trillion abroad over the next decade, Xi said, while outbound Chinese tourists would exceed 500 million over the next five years.As "China's overall national strength grows", he told his audience, it would be able and willing to offer "new initiatives and visions for enhancing regional cooperation".A draft summit communique seen by AFP calls for a "strategic study" on the Beijing-backed FTAAP. But Michael Froman, the US Trade Representative, told reporters Sunday: "It’s not the launch of a new organisation, it's not the launch of a new FTA."FTAAP, he said, was a "long-term aspiration" to be achieved only through other existing negotiations such as TPP, which was "clearly" the priority for the world's biggest economy.The communique refers to "the eventual realisation" of the FTAAP.But whether the leaders will endorse the so-called "Beijing Roadmap" towards the FTAAP remained unclear.
