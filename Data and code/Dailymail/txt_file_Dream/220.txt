 PARIS (AP) - The Latest on the meeting between European leaders and China's president (all times local): 12:10 p.m. The leaders of China and France are trying to ramp up efforts against climate change and are calling for a global rethink of investments to make them more planet-friendly. Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron issued a statement that contrasted with the position of U.S. President Donald Trump, who took his country out of the Paris climate accord partly because of concerns over how it threatened American business. Xi and Macron stressed "the importance of reorienting public and private investment toward fighting climate change and protecting biodiversity," notably in developing countries where China is a major investor. They vowed support for the 2015 Paris agreement to reduce the emissions that cause global warming, including in the energy and refrigeration sectors.
