All religious institutions in China are now required to fly the national flag, in a move to assimilate religions into the socialist society, state media announced on Tuesday.The rule is necessary to strengthen awareness of respect for the flag - a symbol of the country's embrace of communism in 1949 - and preserve the flag's dignity, Xinhua claimed, adding that the practice can enhance the public's national consciousness and civic awareness. This is one of the communist government's latest measures to assert control over religious practices and activities.In an opinion piece on Thursday, the Washington Post accused Beijing of ethnic cleansing against Muslims, saying that the government's policies were 'designed to stamp out their people's religion and culture'.

Share this article Share 252 shares   The Washington Post article said China has been 'expanding a network of internment camps and systematic human rights abuses' in recent years, citing the example of the repression and torture faced by millions of ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang, a Muslim-majority region in the country's far west.  Former inmates have told of the horror after being detained in these camps, where they were physically and mentally tortured and as punishment, were forced to eat pork and drink alcohol. Since last spring, Chinese authorities have reportedly ensnared an estimated 900,000 to one million Muslims - and even foreign citizens - in what the Chinese government calls 'political re-education camps'. US citizen Gulchehra Hoja, a journalist for Radio Free Asia's (RFA) Uighur service, told Washington Post that she has had more than two dozen family members in China detained in the camps, including her elderly parents and her brother, who has not been heard from since his arrest last September. Many of her RFA colleagues have similar stories.'I hope and pray for my family to be let go and released, but I know if that happens they will still live under a constant threat,' she testified last week before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. 'I came to the United States to realise a dream, a dream of being able to tell the truth without fear.'          A child rests near the entrance to the mosque where the national flag is raised and a banner in red reads 'Love the party, Love the country' in the old city district of Kashgar, Xinjiang         The entrance to a jail which locals say is used to hold those undergoing political indoctrination program in Korla in Xinjiang. This detention campaign has swept across the north-west region              The Chinese flag flies over St. Joseph's (left), a government sanctioned church in Beijing. A Chinese flag is raised (right) near a minaret at the Ningxia Islamic institute in YinchuanThis detention campaign has swept across Xinjiang, a territory half the area of India, leading to what a US commission on China said in April is 'the largest mass incarceration of a minority population in the world today'. The programme is a hallmark of China's emboldened state security apparatus under the deeply nationalistic, hard-line rule of President Xi Jinping. Chinese officials have largely avoided comment on the camps, but some are quoted in state media as saying that ideological changes are needed to fight separatism and Islamic extremism. Radical Muslim Uighurs have killed hundreds in recent years, and China considers the region a threat to peace in a country where the majority is Han Chinese. The internment programme aims to rewire the political thinking of detainees, erase their Islamic beliefs and reshape their very identities. The camps have expanded rapidly over the past year, with almost no judicial process or legal paperwork. The government has also destroyed thousands of religious buildings, banned long beards, veils and Muslim names such as 'Mohammed' and 'Jihad'. Women that wore face-covering veils are sometimes not allowed on buses. Unauthorised pilgrimages to Mecca were also restricted.          Children in traditionally Buddhist Tibet were required to sign an agreement to 'not take part in any form of religious activity' during the summer holidays, according to state media         Chinese government has often regarded the Dalai Lama (pictured) as a dangerous separatistJust last week, children in traditionally Buddhist Tibet were required to sign an agreement to 'not take part in any form of religious activity' during the summer holidays, according to a separate report by Global Times.The policy appears to reflect increasingly harsh restrictions on the Himalayan region's traditional Buddhist culture, largely aimed at reducing the influence of the region's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India. In April, the government published a white paper titled 'China's Policies and Practices on Protecting Freedom of Religious Belief', which states that religious groups 'must conduct religious activities in the Chinese context and practice core socialist values'.'China will uphold the principle that religions in China must be Chinese in orientation and provide active guidance to religions so that they can adapt themselves to the socialist society,' Xinhua previously reported, citing the white paper.          Residents walk through a security checkpoint into the Hotan Bazaar where a screen shows Chinese President Xi Jinping in Hotan, Xinjiang         The words 'Patriotism' and 'Democracy' are displayed near a Mao Zedong statue at a square in Kashgar, Xinjiang. Officials have been implementing strict regulations on religious practicesThe new rule of raising of the national flag is to strengthen national consciousness, help religious believers better practice socialist core values and carry forward the tradition of patriotism, the Global Times reported.  Religious venues are also required to display the national flat at prominent locations. The rule was established by heads and representatives of national religious groups including the Buddhist Association, the Taoist Association, the Islamic Association, and the Bishops' Conference of the Catholic Church in a joint conference in Beijing.Five legal religions exist in China - Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism - and have a total of nearly 200 million believers and more than 380,000 clerical personnel, according to Xinhua.
