 BUENOS AIRES, Dec 1 (Reuters) - China's Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Saturday the United States had revoked a plan to raise tariffs on certain Chinese goods to 25 percent on Jan. 1, following a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. China and the United States also decided to not impose new tariffs on other products, Wang said after the meeting, which took place on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Buenos Aires.
