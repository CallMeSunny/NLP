 MOSCOW (AP) - Chinese President Xi Jinping has arrived in Russia for talks focusing on expanding cooperation with Moscow just as tensions have flared up in U.S.-China ties. Russian President Vladimir Putin will greet Xi at a Kremlin dinner Monday. Moscow and Beijing will sign dozens of agreements to deepen their cooperation during Xi's two-day trip. Putin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, described the current Russia-China relations as "the best in history."

Trump, Putin and Xi will attend the Group of 20 summit in Germany later this week.
