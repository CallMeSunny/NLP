Chinese state media urge new status for Xi By Afp   Published: 07:21 BST, 26 October 2016  |  Updated: 07:21 BST, 26 October 2016                e-mail         Most Chinese people want Communist Party chief Xi Jinping to be a 'core' leader in the mould of Mao Zedong, official media said a survey showed, as he seeks to consolidate his control.The People's Tribune magazine, an affiliate of the Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily, this week published results of a survey of 15,000 people.It said they agreed "the rise of a great nation calls for strong, core leadership" -- terminology that denotes the supremacy of a single leader.

"This is of course a huge setback for political and institutional reform because this is very blatant building of a personality cult, a revival of the Maoist personality cult."Regional cadres began using the term "core" for Xi last December, but it then disappeared, suggesting it ran into opposition, he said.But now Xi's allies are orchestrating a campaign to have the status conferred on him, Lam said.Earlier this month, a senior official argued in the Guangming Daily newspaper that "a strong core leadership is needed more than ever before to achieve the great dream of the renewal of the Chinese nation".The People's Tribune said respondents admired Xi's confident strategic thinking, his bravery in facing problems and his "personal charisma".The survey report included dire warnings that weakening the core can "easily cause civil war, invasion by foreign enemies, and the destitution of the people. This is the painful lesson 100 years of blood and tears in recent Chinese history have given us."
