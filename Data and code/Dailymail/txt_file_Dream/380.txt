 WASHINGTON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The United States believes that progress with China on a range of trade issues has been increasingly difficult and Beijing appears on a "trajectory of retrenchment," a senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday. Briefing reporters ahead of President Donald Trump's Nov. 3-14 Asia trip that will include a stop in Beijing, the official said Trump will insist in his talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping that more balance is needed in U.S.-Chinese trade relations.
