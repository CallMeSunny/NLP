 BRUSSELS (AP) - European Union leaders worried about China's growing power are devising plans to counter the ambitions of a country they describe as a "systemic rival." The European Council will discuss on Friday a 10-point strategy set out by the European Commission before an EU-China summit next month. The EU wants to "fully address the distortive effects of foreign state ownership" and "achieve a more balanced and reciprocal economic relationship." China is the EU's second-biggest trading partner behind the U.S. while China is the EU's second largest partner. The trade in goods between the two is worth around 1.1 billion a day, but the balance is largely in China's favor.
