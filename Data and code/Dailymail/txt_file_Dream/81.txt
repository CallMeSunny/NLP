Ministers have drawn up secret plans to nationalise Chinese-run nuclear power stations in the event of relations with the Communist state turning sour, it emerged last night.George Osborne is expected to use a state visit to the UK by Chinese Premier Xi Jinping next week to finalise a deal that will see China invest billions of pounds in the construction of two new nuclear power stations in this country.The country could also then be granted permission to design, build and operate a third power plant at Bradwell in Essex.The move has caused alarm in security circles, with some officials warning that commercial and energy priorities are being placed ahead of national security.         George Osborne is expected to use a state visit to the UK by Chinese Premier Xi Jinping next week to finalise a dealBut last night it emerged that ministers have drawn up contingency plans to seize control of the plants if relations with the Communist state become strained.A Whitehall source told the BBC that Chinese-run reactors could be nationalised ‘as a last resort’.

 Former British intelligence officer Nigel Inkster said the risks of Chinese involvement were hard to assess without seeing details of the contract setting out how the new plants would be run.Mr Inkster, now director of transnational threats at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, warned it was possible that a hostile state could ‘insert some kind of malware’ deep in the software operating the reactors.He said it was essential that ministers insist that manual overrides are put in place to allow operators to shut down rogue software.‘I think we are right to want to know what the strategic risks are,’ he said.         Former British intelligence officer Nigel Inkster said the risks of Chinese involvement were hard to assess without seeing details of the contract setting out how the new plants would be run         Downing Street yesterday insisted that Chinese involvement in the nuclear industry was good for Britain‘Until we see the nuclear deal, we cannot be specific about the risks or how they might be mitigated.’Downing Street yesterday insisted that Chinese involvement in the nuclear industry was good for Britain.A No 10 spokesman said: ‘We are in a new era of engagement with China, we are working closely with them on a number of issues.‘But we take security extremely seriously and will continue to keep it under review.’He went on: ‘We would not be pursuing this course of action if we felt there was a risk to security.’Energy Secretary Amber Rudd also played down security concerns surrounding the Chinese deal. She told the Daily Mail: ‘We have the strongest level of nuclear regulation in the world, and the best record of nuclear safety. That is the system that any country from around the world will have to engage with if it wants to operate here.’But security experts are worried less by the ability of the Chinese to operate nuclear facilities safely than by the potential risk of sabotage.Despite a thawing in relations, Britain’s intelligence agencies continue to regard China as a significant threat, particularly in terms of cyber-espionage.MI5 has warned publicly that the ‘intelligence services of China… continue to work against UK interests at home and abroad’.A security source said: ‘There is a big division between the money men and the security side. The Treasury is in the lead, and it isn’t listening to anyone – they see China as an opportunity, but we see the threat.’But the Treasury is keen to secure Chinese funding for a £25 billion nuclear reactor at Hinkley Point, in Somerset, and a second power station at Sizewell, in Suffolk.During a trip to China last month, George Osborne offered loan guarantees worth £2 billion to help secure Chinese backing for Hinkley Point.Speaking in Beijing, the Chancellor described the proposed deal as ‘a win-win-win for the UK and … a great example of how the relationship with China has a direct material benefit to the people living in our country’.He added: ‘I think we have to confront any anxieties that exist out there about Chinese investment in British civil nuclear power.’Paul Dorfman, of University College London’s Energy Institute, said: ‘No one else in Europe would cut this deal. America wouldn’t dream of letting China have such a part in its critical national infrastructure. The idea the UK is prepared to do it is frankly astounding.’
