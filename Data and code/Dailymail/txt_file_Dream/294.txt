 BEIJING, Oct 17 (Reuters) - China has set a clear direction on reform and opening up to the world and will not deviate from that course, Communist Party spokesman Tuo Zhen said on Tuesday. Tuo made the remarks at a briefing a day ahead of the opening of the key, twice-a-decade party congress that will see President Xi Jinping map out his ambitions for the country and further tighten his grip on power.
