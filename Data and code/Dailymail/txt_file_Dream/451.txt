 WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - A senior Trump administration official on Friday dismissed a media report that said U.S. President Donald Trump was readying a possible trade deal with China as untrue, a CNBC reporter said in a post on Twitter. Earlier on Friday, Bloomberg reported that Trump wanted to reach an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping and had asked key U.S. officials to begin drafting potential terms for a deal.
