 BEIJING, May 27 (Reuters) - China needs to shift away from over-reliance on heavy industries, large-scale and careless expansion, and the depletion of the country's natural resources, President Xi Jinping said on Saturday, according to state media. China's air, water and soil pollution need to be tackled, he added, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Xi said the country's rapid economic growth had caused many environmental problems, according to Xinhua. "Under these circumstances, we must exert significant efforts to reverse course," he said.
