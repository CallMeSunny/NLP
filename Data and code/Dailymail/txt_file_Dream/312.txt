 SHANGHAI, April 25 (Reuters) - China is "days away" from revealing new rules governing its asset management industry, the China Daily newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing an unnamed source close to the country's central bank. Markets have been awaiting the release of the final version of new rules for China's $15 trillion asset management sector as part of a crackdown on risk in China's financial system. President Xi Jinping approved the new rules in March. (Reporting by Andrew Galbraith Editing by Eric Meijer)
