Rising China, geopolitical tensions take stage at APEC By Afp   Published: 21:30 BST, 9 November 2014  |  Updated: 21:30 BST, 9 November 2014                e-mail         World leaders including Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin converge Monday in Beijing for an Asia-Pacific summit against the backdrop of a US-Russian chill and the inexorable rise of the meeting's increasingly assertive host.The gathering is the biggest event yet hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who took over last year and who spotlighted his massive country's expanding world profile on Sunday by declaring a bright future ahead for the vibrant Pacific Rim -- with a confident China at its heart.The annual two-day summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries is a rare chance for such a wide range of top leaders to be in the same room, and the pledges of amity and trade convergence are typically balanced by tense sideline exchanges on festering geo-political problems.

Russia denies the accusations.China and the United States also have jousted over differing visions of how to achieve Asia-Pacific trade integration, adding to persistent discord over commerce, human rights, US accusations of Chinese cyber-espionage, and the territorial disputes.Beijing's growing territorial assertiveness in the South China Sea also has rankled rival claimants to parts of the strategic waterway.It will be all smiles, however, when the APEC leaders gather Monday for the annual "family photo," typically wearing the host's national dress. This year's fashion choice remains a mystery.The event culminates Tuesday with a formal leaders' summit.China is hosting APEC for the first time since 2001, when it was still re-emerging as a world economic power.But in a speech Sunday, Xi underlined how much has changed by offering his vision of an "Asia-Pacific dream" in which China's continued rise offers "infinite promise" to all.
