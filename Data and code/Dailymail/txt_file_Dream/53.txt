 Other impressive missiles in the video include short-range guided missile DF-2, intercontinental ballistic missile DF-5B and long-range guided missile DF-26. DF-26 is capable of carrying nuclear warheads and striking 'important targets on land and medium-to-large ships at sea with precision', according to previous reports.The propaganda video was released yesterday by the Rocket Force on its official account on Twitter-like Weibo. Like a Hollywood trailer, the 80-second clip captures fearless Chinese soldiers conducting missiles drills. It also shows multiple warheads soaring into the skies and blowing up targets.            The video features multiple DF-41 missiles (pictured), which is said to have the longest range of any ballistic rockets in the world and could reach London or the U.S. with nuclear warheads.         The video was released yesterday by the Rocket Force through its official Weibo accountChina has claimed to own around 2,500 missiles. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has two series of missiles, the Dongfeng or 'East Wind' guided missiles and the Julang or 'Giant Wave' nuclear submarine missiles. According to Global People magazine, the Dongfeng missiles are the first series of missiles completely built by the Chinese people and is the country's main weapon for national defence. Last month, Beijing reportedly mobilised its supersonic nuclear missile DF-26 after a U.S. destroyer sailed into the disputed waters in South China Sea. Days later, state broadcaster CCTV aired footage to show the missile being launched. DF-26 has been billed as the 'Guam Killer' by Chinese media as it's said to be capable of reaching Guam, a U.S. territory about 2,000 miles away from the Chinese coast. It's been hailed as Beijing's top weapon against Washington. CHINA'S OTHER MISSILES         China's DF-21 missile boasts a firing distance of up to 1,926 miles (3,100km) and has been dubbed 'the killer of aircraft carrier'.The missile is potentially capable of sinking a U.S. Nimitz-class aircraft carrier in a single strike, media have claimed.The DF-10 missile, on the other hand, is the best performing long-range cruise missile in the world, according to Chinese news site Sina.com.Sina said the 990-pound (450kg) weapon could strike a maximum distance of 1,242 miles (2,000km) and could reach Japan and Taiwan if it's fired from inland China.The DF-15B missile is an improved version of the original DF-15 missile and debuted in 2009 during the military parade to celebrate China's 60th National Day.The missile can reportedly travel at the speed of 2,000 metres (1.4 miles) per second and its striking accuracy is within 30 metres (98 feet).  China's Rocket Force is part the People's Liberation Army which handles the country's growing missile arsenal. The division was founded on January 1, 2016. It was renamed from the former Second Artillery Corps in the two-million-strong membership of the PLA. Commanders at the troop have claimed that their soldiers are 'ready to strike any targets at any time' under Beijing's order. Li Zhenglian, a brigade commander of the Rocket Force, told China Central Television Station in a previous interview: 'As long as there is an order, I am ready to bring out [soldiers] at any time, I can fire [missiles] at any time and I can strike [targets] accurately.'          DF-26 is reportedly capable of reaching the U.S. territory and sink aircraft carriers. The missiles are seen participating in a military parade at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 2015On its inauguration ceremony, the Chinese President Xi Jinping said the move to form the Rocket Force was a major decision made to 'realise the Chinese dream of a strong military'.The decision was also a 'strategic step to establish a modern military system with Chinese characteristics', said President Xi.Since coming to power in 2012, the Chinese President Xi Jinping has trumpeted building a stronger, combat-ready army.
