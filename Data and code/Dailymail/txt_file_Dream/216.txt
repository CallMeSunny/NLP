China football coach Gao Hongbo quits after Uzbek defeat By Afp   Published: 05:22 BST, 12 October 2016  |  Updated: 05:22 BST, 12 October 2016                e-mail         China's national football coach Gao Hongbo announced his resignation after a 2-0 defeat to Uzbekistan left the perennially underachieving side's hopes of reaching Russia 2018 hanging by a thread.The loss in Tashkent on Tuesday left Team Dragon bottom of their third stage qualifying group for the next World Cup, with only one point from four games. Only the top three of the six contenders will progress.Despite being the world's most populous country and second-largest economy, and money pouring into the domestic game after President Xi Jinping declared ambitions to host and one day win the World Cup, China remain minnows on the global football stage.

The meat already stinks, but management doesn't think to toss it out for fresh stuff, it just keeps changing the fridge," wrote one user on the Twitter-like platform Weibo.Gao's brief tenure is even shorter than the average -- since 2000 the side has had 10 coaches, five of them European and five Chinese.After his first stint in charge Gao was replaced by Spaniard Jose Antonio Camacho on a lucrative contract, and talk was already turning to the subject of new successor Wednesday.One supporter wrote that "whenever the national team loses, they just want to switch coach, and always invite a foreign coach. It's not a confident attitude -- it has a bad impact on head coaches, players, local coaches ... It's just worshipping foreign things."Fans called for the sacking of China's football association president Cai Zhenhua after the defeat to Syria, but he has ignored them so far, instead urging the players "not to lose confidence" over their losses.Earlier this year Beijing issued a plan to make Team Dragon one of the world's top sides by 2050, promising 20,000 academies and 30 million elementary and middle school pupils playing the sport within four years.Following the blueprint would bring to life "the sports-superpower dream” and "national revival dream", it said.But despite official backing and huge spending by domestic club owners the national team's travails make hosting the World Cup look a far more realistic goal than winning the competition, as China's sole appearance in 2002 ended without a single point or even a goal.Chinese Super League clubs splashed more than 400 million euros ($447 million) on players this year, luring stars such as Liverpool target Alex Teixeira.China's next match is at home to 2022 World Cup hosts Qatar next month.
