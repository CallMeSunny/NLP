 WASHINGTON, March 28 (Reuters) - The White House said on Wednesday the situation with North Korea was moving in the right direction after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. "We're going to be cautiously optimistic but we feel like things are moving in the right direction and the meeting yesterday was a good indication that the maximum pressure campaign has been working," White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters.
