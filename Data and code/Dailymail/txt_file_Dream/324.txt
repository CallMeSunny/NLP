 SEOUL, June 14 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un landed back in Pyongyang early on Wednesday, the North's official news agency said on Thursday, after departing Singapore Tuesday night following the close of a historic summit with U.S. President Donald Trump. There had been speculation Kim would stop by Beijing to brief Chinese President Xi Jinping on the outcome of the U.S.-North Korea summit and the airplanes the North Korean delegation had left on were closely tracked by international media.
