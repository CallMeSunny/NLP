 WASHINGTON, May 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said the U.S. was not taking a harder stance against China because of his respect for Chinese President Xi Jinping. "I have great respect for President Xi. That's why we're being so nice," Trump told reporters at the White House. His comments came just hours after China announced that large disagreements still loomed over trade between the two countries.
