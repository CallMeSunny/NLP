 VLADIVOSTOK, Russia, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Protectionism and unilateralism were rearing their heads in global politics and the states of northeast Asia should work together to counter that trend, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday. "There are deep and complex changes underway in the international situation, the politics of force, unilateral approaches and protectionism are rearing their head," Xi said at the Eastern Economic Forum on Russia's Pacific coast.
