Donald Trump has told President Xi Jinping that America will honour Washington’s “one China” policy, which has been at the centre of friction between the global powers since his election as US president.During a phone call on Thursday night Mr Trump “agreed, at the request of President Xi”, to honour the policy that requires Washington to maintain only unofficial ties with China’s rival Taiwan, the White House said.The White House described the call as “extremely cordial” and said the two leaders had invited each other to visit.
