 BEIJING, Sept 3 (Reuters) - China will provide $60 billion in financial support to Africa, President Xi Jinping said on Monday at the opening of a major China-Africa summit. The support will be provided in the form of government assistance as well as investment and financing by financial institutions and companies, Xi said in a speech carried live on state television. China will also expand its imports from Africa, especially for resources products, and will facilitate African financial institutions' bond issuances in China, Xi added.
