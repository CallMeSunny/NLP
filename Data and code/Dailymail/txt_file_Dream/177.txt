     Q: So who has agreed to buy what, for how much?A: CMC and another Chinese investment firm, CITIC Capital, will buy 13 per cent of CFG for $400m (£265m). It should be stressed that this is not a deal to buy 13 per cent of Manchester City, but rather the parent company that owns City as well as New York City in MLS, Melbourne City in Australia and a minority stake in Yokohama F Marinos in Japan.CFG also has formal development and/or scouting partnerships with clubs in Denmark (Aarhus), Spain (Espanyol), Ireland (Limerick), Ghana (the Ghana FA), Portugal (Sporting) and elsewhere. CFG also has academy investments in different places. CMC and CITIC are buying 13 per cent of that whole operation in a deal that now values CFG (as opposed to City) at £2billion.         This is not a deal to buy 13 per cent of Manchester City, but rather the parent company that owns the Premier League club as well as New York City in MLS  - Andrea Pirlo (above), among others, plays in New York    Most valuable clubs and their owners  1.

That’s good business, isn’t it?A: Mansour has poured approximately £1bn into City in the past seven years to allow them to buy and pay the players they needed to catch up with big clubs in the Premier League. They made their first profit of his era in 2014-15 but he’s still close to £1bn down on City alone. The $400m from CMC helps, but this deal isn’t really about the cash anyway, as we’ll see.Q: Who are CMC and what is their track record in football?A: CMC was founded by a man called Li Ruigang, known as ‘China’s Rupert Murdoch’ because of his extensive media and entertainment portfolio. He is an influential Shanghai Communist Party member who has thrived in commerce by mixing his business acumen with his political know-how and contacts.CMC have been inking all kinds of major entertainment deals in recent months, including a contract with Warner Brothers to produce and distribute films, and a deal - also involving the Walt Disney Corporation - to back a US-based virtual reality start-up, Jaunt. CMC also spent $1.3bn last year (£861m) to buy the broadcast rights for the Chinese football league for five years.CMC has no track record in football, per se, but is a rapidly expanding multi-media and entertainment company.City, CFG and CMC say it ‘follows more than six months of discussions among the parties to find the optimum model and associated strategies for the partnership.’         CMC chairman Li Ruigang will represent the consortium at CFG by becoming its seventh board member         CFG chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak (centre) claimed the new agreement is 'hugely exciting'           Q: Will City now have Chinese executives influencing their decisions?A: Not quite, although Li Ruignag will become a member of CFG’s board, so will have input into the way the group grows. This is about much more than City, it’s about a Chinese investor realising that football is an international entertainment business.  Q: So what happens to the £265m? Is that going to be given to Manuel Pellegrini to buy players?A: In a word, no! Think about it. Why would City’s owner, Sheik Mansour, who belongs to a family that already controls one of the planet’s largest wealth funds (worth around £500BN) need money from China to bankroll him? He doesn’t. Look at it another way: £265m covers a single year of City’s wage bill plus a few other expenses. It’s not a massive sum of money in modern football.Rather, according to all parties in their press releases: ‘The capital from the share acquisition will be used by City Football Group to fund its China growth, further CFG international business expansion opportunities and further develop CFG infrastructure assets.’         The £265m is not a huge amount in modern football, it would cover City's yearly wage bill and a few expenses  Q: What does that mean in English?A: It means there it is now highly like that a new City franchise will be opening in China in the foreseeable future, like the New York, Melbourne, and yes, Manchester, branches of the franchise.  Q: So what do City get out of it?A: CFG, as opposed to the club based in Manchester, get a highly influential and knowledgeable entertainment and media parter in China, one of the toughest foreign markets to ‘crack’. So the CFG brand should quickly get a foothold in that potentially lucrative territory.This globalisation is something that City’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, has been dreaming about for years. Indeed the former commercial genius of Barcelona outlined his vision in a 2011 book, saying that one day there might be Arsenal and Manchester United spin-offs facing each other within the Chinese league. This is a step towards that.         Man City, New York City, Melbourne City belong to CFG and they have a stake in Yokohama F Marinos    Q: What does Sheik Mansour get out of it?A: As economic and political analysts pointed out when he started the NYCFC franchise in New York, the Abu Dhabi state in which Mansour is such a key political figure, is on the constant lookout for ways to expand their business portfolio into new sectors in new territories as they seek influence and relevance for a post-oil world. Getting into bed with China is a dream from that perspective.
