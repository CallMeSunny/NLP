Li's dream of becoming first Chinese major winner By Afp   Published: 06:45 BST, 22 October 2015  |  Updated: 06:46 BST, 22 October 2015                e-mail         Highly tipped young Chinese golfer Li Hao-tong is aiming to become the first player from his country to join the PGA Tour as he chases his ultimate dream of winning a major.The mainland's number three player, who turned 20 in August, said it would take three years to become comfortable with the field after gaining his PGA Tour card and was under no illusion of the challenges that await him at the highest level.But the ambition of the Hunan-born six-footer is unmistakable.

I am not a European Tour player, I am not an Asian Tour player, I just want to play with some good players."In the past he has singled out world number four Bubba Watson as someone he'd like to emulate but at the Hong Kong Open he held up England's world number seven Justin Rose, who won the 2013 US Open, as someone he admired."He's a really nice guy -- and he's won a major," Li added with a grin.
