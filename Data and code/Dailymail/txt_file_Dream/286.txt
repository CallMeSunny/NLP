 SHANGHAI, July 15 (Reuters) - China has appointed Chen Miner, a rising political star, as the Communist Party boss in the southwestern city of Chongqing, the official Xinhua news agency said on Saturday. Chen, along with a number of other swift-rising officials, is considered a prime contender to be promoted into the Standing Committee at China's five-yearly party congress this autumn. Chen, a trusted confidant of President Xi Jinping, will take over the Chongqing role from Sun Zhengcai, Xinhua said. (Reporting by Adam Jourdan and Ben Blanchard; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)
