 Elite Australian special forces soldiers have been sent to Papua New Guinea to help the impoverished nation secure Port Moresby ahead of a meeting of world leaders next month. Leaders including US Vice President Mike Pence, Russia's President Vladimir Putin, Chinese Premier Xi Jinping and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison are all expected to attend the two-day APEC summit. Royal Australian Navy warships will also be located off the PNG coast to protect cruise ships used for temporary APEC accommodation, the ABC reported on Wednesday.
