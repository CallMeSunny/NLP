 WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping are unlikely to meet before their countries' March 1 deadline to reach a trade deal, two U.S. administration officials and a source familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday. The countries had taken a 90-day hiatus in their trade war to hammer out a deal, and another round of talks is scheduled for next week in China.
