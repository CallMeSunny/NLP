NEW DELHI (AP) — A top official at India's state TV channel says the station has fired a news anchor who referred to Chinese President Xi Jinping as "Eleven" Jinping — apparently mistaking his name for a Roman numeral.Xi left for China on Friday after a three-day visit to India, where he signed more than a dozen agreements to push trade and investment between the two Asian giants.The anchor for the Doordarshan news channel made the gaffe on Wednesday night while she read a news bulletin. She was then "dismissed," the TV station official said Friday.The anchor was a "casual" employee and not a regular staffer, he said.He asked that his name not be used because he did not want to comment publicly on the matter.
