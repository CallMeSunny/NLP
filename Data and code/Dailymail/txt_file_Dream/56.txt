As Xi's star rises, experts ask if the centre can hold By Afp   Published: 17:06 BST, 28 October 2016  |  Updated: 17:06 BST, 28 October 2016                e-mail         Chinese Communist chief Xi Jinping's ascension to the highest title in the party hierarchy formalises his position as its pre-eminent figure, analysts said, making him the country’s most powerful leader in a generation and inviting comparisons with Mao Zedong.The ruling party’s declaration that Xi is the "core" of its leadership saw some observers argue it heralded the beginnings of a personality cult, smacking of the adulation that once surrounded Communist China’s founding father, who ruled for three decades.Others saw it as a crucial step to enforce genuine reform in the world’s most populous country and second-largest economy, including liberalising markets and strengthening the legal system.

Nothing can be accomplished".Regional cadres began using the term "core" for Xi last December, but it then disappeared, suggesting that the Chinese president had encountered resistance to his efforts to further consolidate his power.The move comes ahead of a party congress next year when Xi will have an opportunity to put his own allies into the top Politburo Standing Committee.Jean-Pierre Cabestan of Hong Kong Baptist University said that calls for unity before and at the plenum showed that the party was "far from being monolithic and that Xi is facing difficulties and even headwinds as far as his policy agenda is concerned"."The battle for the next party congress has started but it is far from being over," he said.- 'Power hungry' -Not all are convinced Xi will use his new-found authority for good.He is a "power hungry politician", said Willy Lam, professor of politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong."It's what the psychologists call megalomania: the more powerful you are, the more power hungry you remain."Lam believes that Xi will try to remain in power beyond the two five year terms allowed to the national president by law. There is no formal rule on tenure for the general secretary of the ruling party, the post from which he derives his power."The core can ask for 20 years," he said. "This is a very blatant building of the personality cult... a big step back for institutional reform."Lam is not alone. For many, Xi's new title brings to mind an age-old tradition.One commenter on China's Weibo microblog service posted: "One country, one emperor. It's the way it's been for thousands of years."
