He is to visit the plant on Sunday.Some 20 bilateral agreements are expected to be signed during the visit, including one reinforcing the 2009 strategic partnership, according to Serbian media.China does not recognise Kosovo, the former Serbian province that unilaterally declared independence in 2008 despite Belgrade's opposition.Upon his arrival Xi Jinping attended a ceremony marking the start of construction of a Chinese cultural centre at the site of the former Chinese embassy hit by US-led NATO aircraft during the 1999 bombing campaign against Serbia over its war with ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.Three people were killed in the incident that seriously strained relations between Washington and Bejing at the time.The Chinese president will also attend the inauguration of a monument to Chinese philosopher Confucius.The visit to Serbia is part of a three-nation tour that will also take him Poland and Uzbekistan.
