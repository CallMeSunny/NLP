 BEIJING, April 7 (Reuters) - China said on Friday it is urgent to prevent a further deterioration in the situation in Syria after a U.S. military strike on a Syrian government airfield. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China called on all relevant parties to stick to political settlements. She made the comments during a regular briefing when asked about the U.S. strike, which came as China's President Xi Jinping was attending a summit in Florida with U.S. President Donald Trump.
