China mourns death of Japanese actor Takakura By Afp   Published: 04:10 BST, 19 November 2014  |  Updated: 04:10 BST, 19 November 2014                e-mail         China on Wednesday mourned the death of Japanese film star Ken Takakura, in a rare expression of cultural affinity between the Asian rivals.Takakura, best known in the West for his role as a tough detective in Ridley Scott's "Black Rain", came to prominence in China when Japanese movies were allowed into the country in the late 1970s.He died last week of lymphoma at the age of 83, reports said Tuesday, after a decades-long acting career dotted with starring roles, often as a mobster or a police officer or other strong, silent types enduring hardship in the pursuit of justice.

"I can only express my deepest condolences and wish him happiness in heaven."        Japanese actor Ken Takakura in Tokyo in 2012 ©Toshifumi Kitamura (AFP/File)
