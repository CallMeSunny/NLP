China's President Xi Jinping today unveiled his politburo as he was officially handed a second five year term and broke with tradition to name his 'heir' amid suspicions that he will rule for life.The 64-year-old was formally installed as President at the national congress in a move that will see him rule the world's most populous country at least until 2022.But, unlike all of his predecessors, he failed to name his replacement. Chinese presidents are supposed to serve a maximum of two terms. Now it is believed he may serve much longer.The news came after his name and philosophy were yesterday inserted into the Constitution of the Communist Party of China, elevating him to the same political status as Chairman Mao, the founder of modern China. Scroll down for video          Xi Jinping (centre) unveils members of his new ruling council today.

            Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks during the closing ceremony for the 19th Party Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on October 24. Mr Xi continues to sit atop the new seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, five of whose members were newly appointedXi Jinping, 64, President of China, returning member Mr Xi is widely seen as China's most powerful leader since Chairman Mao Zedong. He is the son of Xi Zhongxun, a Communist revolutionary veteran and vice premier, and spent his teenage years living in a cave in the rural northern Shaanxi Province. Xi Zhongxun was removed from power, publicly humiliated and imprisoned during China's Cultural Revolution, a social-political movement in China between 1966 and 1976 which was set to punish anyone who could potentially challenge Mao's authority. Xi Jinping didn't see his father, who was sent to a factory to work, for seven years during the time. It's said that after the Cultural Revolution ended and when Xi Zhongxun was released back to his family, he couldn't even recognise his own son and had to ask Xi Jinping 'are you Jinping or are you Yuanping'.Xi Jinping was once viewed as a drab 'princeling' child of the elite. But since soaring to power in 2012, Xi has centralised authority under his own leadership with a signature anti-graft battle.His political theory - 'Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era' - was written into the Party constitution on Tuesday, making him the only Chinese leader to be named by the constitution during his term after Mao Zedong.              Li Keqiang (left), the current Premier of China, is the only returning member to the seven-member ruling body. Pictured, Mr Li speaks at the opening session of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China on October 18. Li Zhanshu (right), a new member who was introduced after Li Keqiang is the director of the party's General Office and Mr Xi's confidant. Pictured, Mr Li stands on stage during the unveiling of the Politburo Standing Committee in Beijing on October 25Li Keqiang, 62, Premier of China, returning memberBorn in eastern China's Anhui Province, Mr Li has a legal and economic background. He was sent to the farm to work during the Cultural Revolution. In 1978, he became one of the first university students to resume their studies after the Cultural Revolution. He was enrolled by the Peking University, one of China's best academic institutions. He started his policital career working as the Secretary of Youth League Committee at the Peking University in 1982. He was elected as the Premier of China in 2013. As the party's second-ranking official primarily responsible for overseeing the economy and leading the Cabinet, Mr Li is the only other returning member of the new Politburo.Mr Li's authority was widely viewed as having been undercut by Mr Xi's accumulation of power over all sectors of government, although his continuing presence on the committee appears to speak to the high-regard in which he is held within the party.Mr Li's policies have sought to spur entrepreneurship and innovation, but he has been increasingly overshadowed by Mr Xi, who has thrown his weight behind reforms to make state sector firms 'stronger, better and bigger' and to manage financial stability.Li Zhanshu, 67, Director of the party's General Office, new memberDescribed to be Xi Jinping's confidant, Mr Li is the eldest of all members at the new Politburo Standing Committee and an MBA.He worked his way up from Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, and graduated from Hebei Normal University. A former governor of the northeastern province of Heilongjiang and one-time party boss of the southwestern province of Guizhou, Li Zhanshu is considered one of Xi's closest advisors and often accompanies him on overseas trips. Their friendship dates back to their days working together in Hebei in the 1980s.                New member Wang Yang (left) is the Vice Premier of China while Wang Huning (right), also a new member, is the director of the party's Central Policy Research Office. The two leaders are pictured during the unveiling of the Politburo Standing Committee in the East Hall of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, on October 25Wang Yang, 62, Vice Premier of China, new memberWith an economic portfolio, Mr Wang is a former party chief of Guangdong province, an export powerhouse, where he served from 2007-2012.Born into a poor rural family in eastern Anhui province, Wang went to work in a factory at age 17 to support his family after his father died. Concerned about the impact of three decades of rapid development, he lobbied for social and political reform. However, he backed down after drawing criticism from party conservatives.Wang Huning, 62, Director of the party's Central Policy Research Office, new memberMr Wang was a top policy researcher for the party under former presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, a position he has kept under Xi as head of the Central Policy Research Office. He coined the 'Three Represents' and 'Scientific Outlook of Development' - respectively Jiang and Hu's contributions to party thought, as well as the 'Chinese Dream', Xi's own vision. Wang was formerly an academic at Shanghai's Fudan University, specialising first in international relations and then law. He is also considered one of Xi's closest advisors.               Zhao Leji (left) is the head of the Central Organisation Department responsible for job assignments who is expected to head the much-feared corruption watchdog body. Han Zheng (right) is the Shanghai party leader and a veteran manager of the country's financial hub. Both of them are new members to the Politburo Standing CommitteeZhao Leji, 60, head of the Central Organisation Department, new memberMr Zhao was also named the Chinese Communist Party's new anti-corruption chief on Wednesday. He was named vice governor of the northwestern province of Qinghai in 1994 at age 37. He spent 29 years in Qinghai before being picked by Mr Xi to serve as party boss of Shaanxi province, in the north-west, in 2007. Both Mr Zhao and Mr Xi are natives of Shaanxi. Zhao heads the powerful organisation department, which oversees personnel decisions, and is a Politburo member. He has a degree in philosophy from Peking University.Han Zheng, 63, Party Chief of Shanghai, new memberMr Han is the party chief of Shanghai, China's financial hub, where he has spent his entire career. Han was briefly promoted from Shanghai mayor after the then-party boss was sacked amid a corruption scandal in 2006. He resumed his mayoral role as Xi Jinping and then Yu Zhengsheng - currently the party's fourth-ranked leader - became party chief. Han became Shanghai party boss in 2012.           more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  Harry and Meghan release stunning new photos of their wedding       Watch video  'Wake up': Madonna makes strong political statement at Eurovision       Watch video  Boris Johnson avoids questions about being Tory Prime Minster       Watch video  Theresa May avoids saying Conservatives WILL deliver Brexit           Watch video  'MPs have a stark choice': May prepares for another Brexit vote       Watch video  Police are looking for female who kidnapped child at McDonald's       Watch video  Theresa May agrees to set timetable for her departure from Downing Street       Watch video  Deformed baby cow born with one eye hailed as 'miracle of God'           Watch video  Water rushes past a floodgate after it breaks at Lake Dunlap       Watch video  Amber Rudd is 'not surprised' Boris Johnson wants to be PM       Watch video  Remainer calls on SNP to 'accept democracy' and respect Brexit result       Watch video  Mike Tindall says he hasn't met baby Archie yet but is 'overjoyed'

            From Mao to Xi: The above timeline shows the nine key leaders of People's Republic of China since its founding in 1949          Xi has consolidated power since assuming party leadership in late 2012 and then the presidency in 2013. Pictured, Xi delivers a speech during the opening session of the 19th Communist Party Congress held at the Great Hall of the People on October 18         Communist Party delegates listen to President Xi Jinping giving a 3.5-hour-long speech during the opening ceremony of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on October 18 HOW COULD XI JINPING POTENTIALLY 'RULE FOR LIFE'? According to the clause 79 of the Constitution of China, the maximum number of terms that a President can service is two.This means Xi, who became the president in 2013, will have to retire from the position in 2022.However, Xi's other position, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, has no serving limit. This is also the highest position in the Communist Party of China.As the Communist Party is the ruling party and only major party of China, some believed that the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee is actually the most powerful position in China and suggested Xi could potentially extend his reign through it.  Today, Mr Xi was given a second term as the President of China and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee. He was also named the chairman of the Communist Party of China Central Military Commission.Yesterday, the party unanimously passed the amendment to include 'Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era' as one of its guiding principles at the end of its week-long congress.No other leader since Mao has had an eponymous ideology included in the Constitution of the Communist Party of China while in office until Mr Xi.Deng Xiaoping, widely considered as the father of China's economic reform, has also been named in the constitution, but his name was only added after his death in 1997.Mr Xi's more recent predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, both had the party constitution amended to include their guiding thoughts, but without their names directly attached.Media reports have suggested that Mr Xi has removed his key 'rivals' with his anti-corruption campaign in order to rule China for life.Yesterday's amendment to the party's constitution sparked more speculation that Mr Xi essentially has a mandate to lead for as long he wants.               No other leader since Mao Zedong (right) has had an eponymous ideology included in the Constitution of the Communist Party of China while in office until the current Chinese president Xi Jinping (left). Above, Xi waves to attendees at the 19th National Congress         Xi has rapidly consolidated power since assuming party leadership in late 2012 and then the presidency the next year. Pictured, Xi delivers a speech during the opening session of the 19th Communist Party Congress held at the Great Hall of the People on October 18 WHAT IS CHINA'S POLITBURO STANDING COMMITTEE?  China's Politburo Standing Committee is a seven-member committee that holds the ultimate power.The committee is elected once every five years at the national congress and makes decisions on the most important issues regarding the country's future using a voting system.All members of the Politburo Standing Committee are hand-picked by the President from the 25-member Politburo- the second tier in Beijing's power structure.Apparently, there is an official ranking within the seven-member committee. The ranking is usually suggested by where the member stands in relation to the President when they meet the public - the closer the more senior.The members' roles are described to be the 'core' leaders of the Party and follow strict rules of the National Congress, Central Committee and the Politburo, as well as give guidance according the principle of democratic centralism.It's understood that the members will cast their votes in 'closed-door' meetings to determine the military, political, economic directions of the country. Source: People's Daily Online, Reuters, CNBC    Although China has time limit on how long a President could serve, there seems to be no limit on Mr Xi's other positions. According to the clause 79 of the Constitution of China, the maximum number of terms that a President can service is two, which means Xi, who became the president in 2013, will have to retire from the position in 2022.However, Xi's other position, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, has no serving limit. This is also the highest position in the Communist Party of China.As the Communist Party is the ruling party and only major party of China, some believed that the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee is actually the most powerful position in China and suggested Xi could potentially extend his reign through it.Mr Xi continues to sit atop the new seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, five of whose members were newly appointed. The make-up of the committee reflects Mr Xi's efforts to foster party unity by striking a balance between different interest groups in the 89-million member organisation as he seeks to better position a reinvigorated party to dominate China's affairs at home and abroad.They will assume responsibility for running the rubber-stamp legislature, the National People's Congress and its advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and assume a range of portfolios, including those responsible for propaganda, party discipline, ethnic and Taiwan affairs and science and technology. Mr Zhao is expected to head the much-feared corruption watchdog body, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.Mr Xi has made his wide-ranging anti-corruption campaign the hallmark of his first five years in office. While popular among ordinary Chinese, it is seen as part of a drive to purge his rivals and political opponents and boost supervision over the party at all levels.Alongside the campaign, Mr Xi has overseen one of the harshest crackdowns on civil society aimed at squelching dissent and activism among lawyers and rights advocates.The new leaders will face challenges that include reining burgeoning levels of debt seen as the biggest threat to economic stability and managing trade tensions with Washington and Europe over China's excess production of steel and other goods.          Chinese President Xi Jinping (left) shake hands China's former president Jiang Zemin (right) at the Chinese Communist Party's Congress on October 18. Never before had a Chinese leader's name been inserted into the party constitution while they were in office since Mao Zedong         The party unanimously passed the amendment today to enshrine President Xi's ideology into its most influential document.
