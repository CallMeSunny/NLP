 BEIJING, Oct 17 (Reuters) - China will make sure deleveraging will not have a negative impact on the economy and the country will continue to open up to the world as part of reform, Communist Party spokesman Tuo Zhen said on Tuesday. Tuo made the remarks at a briefing a day ahead of the opening of the key, twice-a-decade party congress that will see President Xi Jinping map out his ambitions for the country and further tighten his grip on power.
