Beijing is understood to be keen on investing 100 billion dollars in the country in the next five years.          Big spender: Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive on September 17.Xi’s big-ticket investments coincide with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream of high-speed trains, smart cities, roads and ports, and mega infrastructure and power projects. India and China will explore the road ahead for Gujarat leading the manufacturing hub project, on the lines of development in Guandong. Two industrial parks - one each in Gandhinagar and Pune - are expected to be announced during this high-profile visit. The Chinese automobile industry is keen to make its presence in Pune and will be exploring options. China wants to invest big-time in bullet trains and other high-speed trains (150-160 km/hr plus), lay the track, invest in automation system and also work on the Metro train system in many of the 50 cities where MRTS (Mass Rapid Transit System) projects are a part of Modi’s dream.The Asian giant seeks to invest in ports, energy sector and also move forward on a key Modi government project - interlinking of rivers and dredging. China, according to sources, has attractive plans for projects close to the prime minister's heart. China’s aim is to tell India that both the neighbours have to overcome the trust deficit of 1962, and the Gujarat meeting is all about bringing the personal touch to the improved relationship that Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping can provide, the sources said.
