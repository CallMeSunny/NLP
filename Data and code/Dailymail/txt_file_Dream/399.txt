 BERLIN, May 22 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel is not expected to discuss the idea of replacing the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency with her Chinese hosts when she visits the country later this week, a senior German official said. Asked whether reining in the dollar could be on the agenda in Beijing, where Merkel will meet President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, the official said: "Replacing the dollar as a global reserve currency, it is not about that."
