Xi, Abe meet as big-power rivalries take APEC centre-stage  By Afp   Published: 12:34 BST, 10 November 2014  |  Updated: 12:35 BST, 10 November 2014                e-mail         The leaders of China and Japan held an ice-breaking summit Monday after two years of dangerous animosity, as world leaders including Barack Obama gathered for an Asia-Pacific meeting spotlighting intensifying big-power rivalries.Xi Jinping and Shinzo Abe met in Beijing's Great Hall of the People in what the Japanese prime minister said was a "first step" towards repairing the fractured relationship between the world's second- and third-largest economies.US President Obama flew in still wounded by the Democrats' defeat in the US mid-term elections and with relations between Washington and Moscow in deep freeze, while his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin arrived a day earlier and quickly signalled his desire for ever-warmer ties with an increasingly assertive China.

Russia denies the accusations.Russia and China express impatience with a perceived American domination of world affairs, often vetoing or abstaining from US-led initiatives on the UN Security Council.The often blunt-spoken Putin told APEC delegates the two sides would seek to increase use of their yuan and ruble currencies, saying the dollar's influence would "objectively decline".- 'Candid' conversations -China and the United States have already jousted in Beijing over differing visions of Asia-Pacific trade integration, adding to discord over rights, cyber-espionage, and territorial disputes.The White House has said it expects "candid and in-depth conversations" between Obama and Xi.As well as the row with Japan -- a US security ally which Washington is bound by treaty to defend if attacked -- Beijing's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea has also rankled rival claimants to its waters.Another likely topic between Xi and Obama is North Korea, following the surprise weekend release of two Americans imprisoned by the secretive state.Beijing is Pyongyang's closest ally.China put on a dazzling welcome for the APEC leaders, lighting up the capital's huge Olympic park as they arrived for an opening banquet in high-collared traditional Chinese tunics with a sleek modern design.The event culminates Tuesday with a formal leaders' summit.APEC kicks off a week of high-level summitry that will see Obama and other top leaders travel next to Myanmar for the East Asia Summit, followed by G20 talks in Brisbane, Australia.China is hosting APEC for the first time since 2001, when it was still re-emerging as a world economic power.But in a speech Sunday, Xi underlined how much has changed by offering his vision of an "Asia-Pacific dream", in which China's continued rise offers "infinite promise" to all.
