 BEIJING, Dec 13 (Reuters) - China will keep its economic growth in 2019 within a reasonable range, the politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, said on Thursday in remarks carried by the state news agency Xinhua. The government will further stabilise employment, the financial sector, foreign trade, investment and market expectations, Xinhua said, citing a politburo meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping. China will balance its efforts to stabilise growth, promote reforms, prevent risks and will boost market confidence, Xinhua said.
