Growing up with 13 siblings on the island of Ha'apai in Tonga, Malakai Fekitoa had already decided on his destiny.By the age of 14 his father, a brother and a sister had all passed away and Fekitoa became the man of the house.'Everything crashed,' he says. 'Dad was a carpenter and he was the only person who provided for us. Mum struggled for a while and that's when I realised no one was going to help us. That's when I put everything on rugby.'         Malakai Fekitoa has given up his All Blacks dream to play for first Toulon and now Wasps   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       It's crunch time in Heineken Champions Cup, the world of...

   Fekitoa slept in a hut with his brothers and cousins. They were hunters who lived off the land and caught fish by diving with a spear.'People talk about the struggles but life was great,' he says. 'We didn't have much but we didn't need much. There were no TVs, no phones, no video games and that was the best part of it. We had the beach and the outdoors.'What followed Fekitoa's childhood is a well-worn story of Pacific Island rugby. He moved to New Zealand aged 16 on a scholarship. There were battles with homesickness but he went on to represent the All Blacks and won the World Cup in 2015. The international stage catapulted him to global stardom and so he signed for big-spending Toulon. He continues to cash in on his talent and his next move will take him to Wasps.'I left New Zealand to support my family,' says Fekitoa. 'I don't just support my mum. I support my younger brothers and sisters, my nieces, my nephews. I've got close to 30 nieces and nephews around the world. Being able to support them is the best feeling ever.'         Fekitoa's arrival will help boost Wasps with England utility back Elliot Daly likely to leaveAged 26, Fekitoa will arrive in English rugby in his prime. A lean and powerful centre, he will team up in midfield with former team-mate Lima Sopoaga, easing the imminent exit of England's Elliot Daly.For now, he has sacrificed his international career and will watch this year's World Cup on TV in the Midlands. 'Watching the All Blacks is always hard because I know what I can do,' he explains. 'It's difficult but, at the same time, I feel proud watching the guys.'I didn't just decide to leave. I thought about it for months and months and I believe I made the right decision. Whatever decision you make, you've got to back it 100 per cent and go with it.'Speaking about Fekitoa's arrival, Wasps coach Dai Young said: 'It's a statement of intent for everyone out there who thought we had given up on trying to compete at the top. We are losing some players but we are bringing some quality players in.'         Fekitoa was part of the 2015 World Cup winning All Blacks squad and has 24 international capsFekitoa will not be the only young Kiwi plying his trade in the Premiership. He follows the likes of Sopoaga, Charles Piutau, Steven Luatua and Matt Proctor who have all traded in the All Black dream. The iconic jersey is losing its pull but does Fekitoa see the All Blacks losing their power?'A lot more people are moving over now but in New Zealand there is always someone coming through who can fill in,' he says.'People have started talking up Ireland but I still back the boys back home. The game is changing. It's a business. You don't play for ever and people are starting to get that now.'         The centre is delighted to be able to support his extensive family of 30 relatives   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       It's crunch time in Heineken Champions Cup, the world of...
