Eddie Jones may think that his current England squad are nowhere near as good as Sir Clive Woodward’s World Cup-winning outfit, but Jonny Wilkinson sees plenty of similarities between both sides.By beating the Wallabies at Twickenham, England equalled their record of 14 consecutive Test wins set by Woodward’s all-conquering class of 2003. In the aftermath of last Saturday’s 37-21 victory, Jones insisted that his squad are still miles off the standards set by that stellar squad containing household names such as Martin Johnson, Will Greenwood, Lawrence Dallaglio and Jason Robinson.Wilkinson is better placed than anyone to compare both teams. The legendary No 10 led England to World Cup glory in Sydney 13 years ago and has worked as a coaching consultant on Jones’s backroom staff over the past 12 months.

That nail-biting 15-13 victory over the All Blacks in Wellington in 2003 when his side were temporarily reduced to 13-men, after back rowers Dallaglio and Neil Back were in the sin-bin, springs to mind. Fast forward to 2016 and Jones’ side have showed the same steel in adversity. Down to 14-men against Argentina after five minutes? No problem. Trailing 10-0 against Australia after 15 minutes? A minor setback.

   ‘If anything, it just feels like there’s an ability to control their own destiny,' says Wilkinson on England’s current squad.‘By that, I mean whatever’s happening to them on the field, they’re starting to look like they’re just capable of understanding it and reforming it and remoulding it into something that works for them and then channelling all that power and passion through something else.’         The former England No 10 kicks a last minute drop goal to clinch the 2003 World Cup         Wilkinson, pictured with ex-coach Sir Clive Woodward after victory in Sydney, has been working as a coaching consultant for EnglandWilkinson was hugely impressed with England’s display against the Pumas earlier this month when Elliot Daly was sent off early in the contest. Despite being a man down for 75 minutes, Dylan Hartley and Co ground out an impressive 27-14 victory over the World Cup semi-finalists. It was a huge statement.‘It’s about being able to say “right, hold on, we’ve lost a guy after five minutes, it’s not how we prepared”,’ Wilkinson explains.‘To be able to say “right, we’re up against it a fabulous side. We’re OK, no worries, we’ll work it out”. That’s the kind of the same image that’s coming to me through training to preparing for the next game. These guys are just picking up the ability to respond and choose the journey they want and they’re choosing at the moment to go out there and perform.’Wilkinson, who amassed an English record points total of 1,179 during his Test career, has worked closely with the fledgling and ever-improving 10-12 axis of George Ford and Owen Farrell during Jones’ tenure.         Wilkinson was particularly impressed at how England ground out a victory over Argentina, despite losing a man after five minutes - pictured is Jonny May scoring a tryThe former Newcastle and Toulon fly-half was at Twickenham last Friday overseeing the duo’s kicking session.‘For me, it’s about me trying to help organise their energy from outside of the bubble,’ says Wilkinson on his role with England.‘The bubble of international rugby can very very intense. It can get very, very pressure-filled. It’s not to try to add anything. I don’t have anything to add to these guys, I promise you, I go there and watch and I’m in awe of what they’re doing and how they’re doing it.’So, if Warren Gatland came calling. Would he consider a similar role on the Lions coaching staff next summer?‘I’m a rugby player in my past and it’s been a fabulous journey, and I’m definitely a massive Lions supporter, but, at the same time, this is a new era and I’ve made no secret of the fact that this may not be where I fit in best at all.’         Wilkinson speaks with England's Owen Farrell during a training session at Twickenham         George Ford (centre)  has also been learning tricks of the trade from Wilkinson this yearFor now, Wilkinson has enough on his plate. None more so than taking care of Jones’ dog Annie, a white papillon, when the Red Rose head coach is out of the country.‘That’s a lot of pressure as well. That wasn’t necessarily an easy ride. I’ll tell you there were a few moments there when I was thinking: ‘"this is more pressure than playing", but I’ve never been so accountable to the coach in all of my life.’It’s been quite the turnaround since last year’s disastrous World Cup campaign and Wilkinson has no doubt that Jones has been the catalyst for England’s 2016 revival: ’You see it’s not all about tactics with him, he’s a big culture builder.'He’s big at getting to understand people and how to get people moving and motivated.’  Jonny Wilkinson was speaking at the Jonah Lomu Memorial Dinner, readers can donate to the Trust at www.jonahlomulegacy.com    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       England are a great team under Eddie Jones... but not quite...
