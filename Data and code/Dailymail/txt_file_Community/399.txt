Whether it's a perfect dream or an absolute nightmare, most of us would love to know what our dreams are trying to tell us.From bumble bees and angels to a lighthouse and trees, the different symbols and pictures we see in our slumber hold various meanings. Delphi Ellis, a qualified therapist and professional dream interpreter, spoke to Spirit and Destiny Australia magazine about the different symbols and signs to look our for in our dreams.

 PUPPIESThe old adage says you can't love others without first loving yourself, and dreaming of a puppy or baby animals can represent a need to take care of yourself. Loyalty, good nature and a kind heart are found in puppies, and may be telling you that you're a good companion. They might also represent quick thinking that could lead to stressful situations.         Dreaming of a puppy or baby animals suggests you are a loyal friend with a good heart (stock image)'This symbol may suggest that, like a puppy, your thoughts sometimes run away from you, or you are easily distracted,' Delphi said.         Delphi Ellis revealed the dream meanings in Spirit and Destiny AustraliaPuppies can also be fiercely protective, which may create conflict where it doesn't need to be.PAIR OF SHOES While it would come as no surprise that women will probably dream about shoes more often than not, they may hold more meaning than just a birthday wishlist.'If you dream of shoes it’s a sure sign that you are, or need to be, grounded so you can be in touch with everything that’s happening around you,' Delphi told the publication.Seeing shoes in your dream may also be a telling sign that someone has been overly judgemental around you, which has caused tension.As they say, you can't judge until you've walked a mile in another's shoes.         'If you dream of shoes it’s a sure sign that you are, or need to be, grounded,' Delphi said (stock image)A CROWN Dreaming of a crown may seem regal, but it symbolises a drama queen in your life.Steer clear of their drama and focus on what brings you joy and remember that wealth and status will not bring long-lasting happiness.They are, like history suggests, a symbol of success and victory also, and bring a message of positive times approaching.Keep your eyes peeled for a great opportunity, but remember that great things come in time and not to let negative moments bring you down.         Crowns are a symbol of success and victory and bring a message of positive times approaching (stock image)AN ANGELDreaming of angels is often what we wish for, as they bring with them love and security.They are messengers and may communications that are special only to you.As signs of unconditional love and protection, they are a type of dream we all wish to have. 'Whether unconditional love is present or has been missing from your life, this is validation that it is all around you, especially if you take positive steps towards the life and love you deserve,' Delphi said.         As signs of unconditional love and protection, angels are a type of dream we all wish to have (stock image)LILY FLOWERS Lily's are a traditional symbol of grief and loss, and dreaming of the flower helps us to remember our loss, according to Delphi.The lily represents loss that may not be physical either, such as losing a necklace of sentimental value or a relationship breakdown.'The lily is not a prediction of loss, more a sign for you to acknowledge past hurt. It’s time to let go of the hold the past has over you and start again,' Delphi told the magazine.         Lily's are a traditional symbol of grief and loss, and dreaming of the flower helps us to remember our loss (stock image)The lily signals a time for rebirth and a much-needed change.While there are countless signs and symbols in our dreams, it's important to keep track of what they mean and how they shape our lives. 'By analysing dream symbols and their meanings, we can make sense of the world around us, and positively influence the life journey ahead of us,' Delphi said.
