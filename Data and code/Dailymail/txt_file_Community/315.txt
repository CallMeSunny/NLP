 Defensive tackle Destiny Vaeao was among the seven players made inactive by the Philadelphia Eagles for Super Bowl LII on Sunday. Vaeao was the only one of the seven who was active for the NFC Championship Game against the Minnesota Vikings, recording a lone tackle while playing 11 snaps (16 percent) on defense. The Eagles opted to go with an additional linebacker against the New England Patriots, with veteran Dannell Ellerbe made active. The Eagles' other inactive players are: offensive tackle Will Beatty, wide receiver Marcus Johnson, rookie cornerback Sidney Jones, defensive end Steven Means, defensive tackle Elijah Qualls and running back Wendell Smallwood. --Field Level Media
