WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump is predicting "a very difficult" meeting next week with Chinese President Xi Jinping, citing trade deficits and lost jobs.Hours after both governments announced an April 6-7 summit between the economic powerhouses in Florida, Trump sought to set expectations by tweeting: "The meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits and job losses. American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives."Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said earlier Thursday that the meeting is a chance for the leaders to build a relationship.Relations between the U.S. and China have been uncertain since Trump's election. Among other things, he has accused China of unfair trade practices and threatened to declare it a currency manipulator.
