   Mesut Ozil added a second in stoppage time to give Arsenal Champions League escape route after losing their first two games in the group against Dinamo Zagreb, when Giroud was sent off, and Olympiakos, when he was suspended. He was thrilled to make amends.'It's a big relief,' said Giroud. 'We defended throughout the game, it wasn't easy. We came up against a Bayern side that loves to get on the ball and created a lot of chances.Â 'Petr Cech was great and our defence was quite simply remarkable. Even though we had some chances, we needed to be patient to take the lead and we finished the job off with Mesut's goal.

I think we did that rather well.'Now we can look ahead. It's good to have won this match because it means we're still on track for the last 16, but we'll need to beat Olympiakos and Zagreb, and why not cause Bayern a few problems over there.'Arsenal's next date in Europe is in Munich in a fortnight.
