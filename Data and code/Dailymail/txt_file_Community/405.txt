‘Los Angeles is my f**king destiny’: MailOnline goes in search of old mobster LA as Mickey Cohen is brought back to life in 1940s-set Gangster Squad By Kimberley Dadds   Published: 18:59 BST, 28 May 2013  |  Updated: 07:34 BST, 29 May 2013    


         e-mail          26 View  comments    There’s no doubt about it, renowned mobster Mickey Cohen was a fan of Los Angeles.So much so he tried to take it completely over, along with the rest of the west coast of America.But thanks to an undercover group of cops in 1949 the mob never got a foothold in the city and Mickey was eventually taken down – sent to Alcatraz in fact thanks to their secret mission.Scroll down for exclusive Gangster Squad deleted scene and trailer videos...     Bringing back the genre: Gangster Squad follows 1940s Los Angeles as gangster Mickey Cohen, played by Sean Penn, tries to take over the city It’s a tale well told throughout literature, history books and even immortalised on screen in television and movies over the years.But now the genre is being brought to the masses for a new generation once more thanks to Ruben Fleischer’s Gangster Squad.It’s a winning formula, casting man of the moment Ryan Gosling as one of the hard ball cops, as well as an underlying love story with himself and actress Emma Stone, who plays Grace Faraday – Mickey Cohen’s arm candy.     A convincing cover: Crook Mickey Cohen, played by Sean Penn, portrayed himself as a debonair businessman and friend to the stars such as Frank Sinatra That, partnered with Sean Penn as the titular character and Josh Brolin as the lead sergeant going after him and Fleischer has himself a hit.And while the period film oozes style and mystique thanks to the 1940s glamorous setting, it seems old mobster Los Angeles is still relevant today.To celebrate the launch of the Gangster Squad DVD, out in the UK now, I attempted to retrace the steps of Mickey Cohen (as well as, of course, Ryan Gosling).     The love interest: Emma Stone plays Grace Faraday who attracts the attention of a mobster and a member of the Gangster Squad in the movie     Femme fatale: Ryan Gosling stars as Sgt Jerry Wooters - one of two characters in the film to fall for Grace Faraday played by Emma Stone  What struck me the most was how much Los Angeles must have changed since the days of Mickey Cohen, the drug cartels and the murders – yet at the same time so much of the city is still in the shadows of its former self.It’s been reinvented once or twice but the same dated feel still remains.Take Slapsy Maxie’s, the main bar seen throughout the movie where Cohen happily flaunts his business in full view of the cops.There are still so many restaurants and bars still oozing the same style, the chandeliers and mystic romance.I even dined at a restaurant in Studio City similar to the ones Cohen spent his time in when he wasn’t plotting undercover operations or chastising his gang of men.      Deleted scene: Emma Stone, who has starred in Crazy, Stupid, Love with Ryan Gosling before, shows off their chemistry in a touching deleted scene obtained by the MailOnline        Emotional: The Griffith Park Observatory can be seen in the background of the shoot, which gives stunning views of Los Angeles            Vitello’s is a classic Italian restaurant, complete with a room for jazz music and separate rooms that can be hired where you can imagine the likes of Cohen would have slammed the door and got his secret talks underway back in the day.But while hints of 1940s LA are spotted all over town, the people and goings on are somewhat different to the Cohen mobster days.I met a musician named Steve at the classic Italian restaurant, who got lost in the jazz music strumming from the artists on stage.     Gangster Squad: Giovanni Ribisi, Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Anthony Mackie, Michael Pea and Robert Patrick all star in the film about mobster Mickey Cohen's reign over post-war Los Angeles But polar opposite to Cohen, Steve’s finishing words of the evening were: ‘I’ve got to go, my cougar’s waiting for me, she’s paying my rent this month,’ followed by an outcry of: ‘What?! This is LA!,’ before he scuttled off.But it’s certainly not the LA of Mickey’s day, where it was young girls who would be hanging off his arm and living on his stash of cash rather than the other way around.Grace Faraday, played by Emma Stone in the film, is desperate to get away from the criminal mastermind, even more so when she falls in love with sergeant Jerry Wooters, played expertly by Ryan Gosling.The pair have, of course, been on screen together before in Crazy, Stupid, Love.And their obvious chemistry is seen in a deleted scene that MailOnline has obtained from Warner Brothers.In the clip the pair embrace for a passionate clinch while at the Griffith Park Observatory, set in a perfect spot to view the whole of Los Angeles.     'It's not ugly, it's just over': Rumour has it that Brolin - seen here with Ryan Gosling in Gangster Squad - and Lane have been separated for several months        Instructions from the top: Nick Nolte stars as the LA Police Chief Bill Parker who, in the film, orders Sgt Jack O'Mara to focus on Mickey Cohen's criminal operation And just standing in the idyllic position made you want to mimic Sean Penn’s words in the film while in character as Cohen: ‘I love Los Angeles, I love it,’ and more harrowing earlier in the movie during one angst ridden scene: ‘This is my destiny. Los Angeles is my f**king destiny, mother f**ker.’On the day I visited the spot I had a clear view of the Hollywood sign, which in Gangster Squad still remains in its original form of ‘Hollywoodland’.The iconic landmark is another marker of the old Hollywood and LA, as part of the city today as The Grove and Bristol Farms now is.And other landmarks remain that were immortalised in Gangster Squad to complete its 1940s feel.Take City Hall, it’s based near Broadway, one of the main streets that remains today similar to that of the 1940s.           Based in Downtown the impressive building was used by Fleischer throughout the film.But while it was the setting for dodgy goings on back in the day, it seems its location near Skid Row is still something to be wary of.My tour guide even warned me to not even walk down the area for fear of being a target for crime, far from the feel I was getting from the rest of the accommodating city in modern 2013.Today psychics, scientology buildings, shopping malls and health food and fast food stores litter the streets.     The unofficial force: If arrests needed to be made, the Gangster Squad called in their uniformed colleagues And rather than predominantly having back street eateries and clubs with a strict entry policy, wining and dining is bold and bountiful.Even the likes of Gordon Ramsay have now got a foothold in the city with his impressive The London West Hollywood Hotel with its modern rooftop restaurant overlooking the LA skyline while serving the finest of dining.It’s not something Cohen would have seen in 1949, although the urban Union Station would have no doubt crossed his path on numerous occasions and is also a big part of the movie. It serves as its real purpose of a train station at the beginning of the film, where Cohen’s men target a young blonde hoping to make her fortune in Hollywood but her gullibility lands her in trouble with the mobsters.     'I don't do wrecks': Charles Shubb with a 1941 Plymouth Special Deluxe used in Gangster Squad. He collected cars as a hobby while running his construction company until a chance meeting with an art director in 1985 led to his movie car business. He now owns 60 classic vehicles   It was then used as the outside of the so-called police headquarters throughout the picture.And it seems Ryan Gosling was impressed with how the producers and crew managed to transform the city to allow fans to go back in time and see 1949 LA thanks to the impressive sets.He said: ‘The production design was incredible.  Living in Los Angeles since I was 16, you're always living in the shadows at the time period.  You feel like you look down one street, you kind of squint your eyes, you could almost see how it was.  To have that come to light was pretty surreal.  They did such a great job.  ‘I know that I felt that way but I, remember being in Slapsy Maxie’s one day and there was a guy there, not part of the movie, who had been in Slapsy Maxie's when Mickey Cohen was there.  He was having this very surreal experience because he was talking about how authentic it was.’     'These are my babies': Garvin Kotzin, 63, poses with his 1936 Oldsmobile convertible with a tan ragtop featured in Gangster Squad  Something else the producers ensured was made to look authentic was the cars placed throughout the film.The opening scenes show Cohen getting a couple of cars to pull a man in two in the opening minutes.     Real-life mobster: Career criminal Mickey Cohen, pictured in 1949, was closely watched by the Gangster Squad and jailed for 15 yearsThe cars were of course classic and vintage, with every detail paid attention to.To bring the story of mobster Mickey Cohen's reign over post-war Los Angeles to life, the director of Gangster Squad employed not only Sean Penn, Josh Brolin and Ryan Gosling - but more than 100 irreplaceable vintage American cars.There's the 1941 light blue Ford Deluxe Convertible that Gosling's character drives; the bulbous, bullet-nosed 1947 Ford sedans that served as police cars; the gorgeous black 1936 Oldsmobile convertible with a tan ragtop; and the regal 1949 Packard Super 8 limousines that carried Cohen.These rare beauties are stars themselves, bringing an authenticity and aesthetic charm to the screen that no computer graphics can match.And to get a feel for the vehicles themselves I headed to the Petersen Automobile Museum in my bid to relive the days of 1940s LA.A car enthusiast myself it was a car lovers' playground, full of vehicles that would have packed out Los Angeles in the same era.And it seems it was the small details such as the cars which helped the cast get into character and make the film truly feel like it was based in the era.     Opposing sides, same methods: Mobster Mickey Cohen, played by Sean Penn pictured left, in a clandestine meeting with Sgt John O'Mara played by Josh Brolin Brolin commented: ‘For us, you have a concept of a performance, you have an idea of a performance and then you have to be malleable within that because, you maybe looking at the Observatory as it was back when, with a street full of cars from the 1940's,  and you go, “Wow, this is really cool.”'And Stone added: ‘It was incredible to see that period because the set design was incredible, so it really felt like you were walking right back into the '40s.  To play a woman in that time period - I was watching movies with '40's actresses and I figured she [Grace] was inspired by those women.  So it was very cool to bring out the ‘broad.’’I even got a tour of Warner Brothers studios during my trip retracing the steps of Cohen.While the main points of interest for my modern day group was a perfectly preserved Central Perk from the Friends set and the studios for Two And A Half Men, it was an insight into what a big operation films like Gangster Squad are.     Members of the Gangster Squad - including Officer Navidad Ramirez played by Michael Pena, left, and Officer Coleman Harris played by Anthony Mackie - carried out drive-by shootings and used other intimidation tacticsAnd indeed how the movie industry took off in the town, even in 1949.Warner Brothers celebrates its 90th anniversary this year and the studio is well known for its gangster films, somewhat of a legacy in fact, which is perhaps now being continued thanks to Fleischer.The director mused: ‘I think there is a lot of pride that I felt from the studio in making this movie.  They don't make gangster movies that often and I know that Jeff Robinov was really proud of the fact that Warner Bros. was built on gangster movies.       A tough bunch: Josh Brolin plays Sgt John O'Mara, pictured left next to Nick Nolte as Chief Parker, who is a church-going Spencer Tracy lookalike with piercing blue eyes ‘The walls of the hallways are filled with the faces of Edward G. Robinson, and James Cagney.  I think there's a real pride in this movie, because we got to make a classic genre gangster movie.  We tried to honor that tradition as much as possible.  So hopefully, 90 years from now there will be the faces of the cast of Gangster Squad hanging on the walls of Warner Bros.‘We really had conscientiousness in making this film, to make sure that it connected with the modern audience.  And it was fun and exciting and entertaining, but that it paid tribute to the tradition of classic gangster movies.  What we really wanted was a modern classic, one that could function on both levels.  ‘Really paying tribute to the past but connecting to a modern audience.  We want this to be a gangster movie for the next generation, because there hasn't been a classic gangster movie of this style for a long time. So we're hoping that the kids of today will really feel like this is their gangster movie.’Gangster Squad was released on DVD in the UK on Monday 27th May.      Hit movie: Gangster Squad is now out on DVD and features a stellar cast including Ryan Gosling, Sean Penn, Josh Brolin and Emma Stone
