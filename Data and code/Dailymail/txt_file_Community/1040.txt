Prime Minister David Cameron brought Chinese President Xi Jinping to his favourite pub for a pint and a portion of fish and chips last night.The trip to The Plough at Cadsden in Buckinghamshire lasted just 20 minutes, during which time they both ate and drank a Greene King IPA.Mr Xi sampled his long-awaited British fish and chips supper, and Mr Cameron - who paid for the drinks with a £10 note - said the meal was ‘very good’.Scroll down for video          Paying with a tenner: Prime Minister David Cameron (right) gets out money to buy drinks with Chinese President Xi Jinping (right)         Drinking: Mr Xi (left) and Mr Cameron (right) enjoy a Greene King IPA at the The Plough at Cadsden pub yesterday         Saying hello: Mr Cameron (right) leaves the pub near Chequers in Buckinghamshire following a pint with Mr Xi (left) yesterday evening         Making an entrance: The trip by Mr Cameron and Mr Xi to The Plough at Cadsden in Buckinghamshire lasted just 20 minutes         Having a drink: Mr Xi was able to sample his long-awaited British fish and chips supper, and the Prime Minister said it was ‘very good’         Evening out: The pair arrived at the quaint village pub at 6.40pm, after driving the 2.5 miles from the Prime Minister's residence of Chequers         Mr Cameron (right) pauses while drinking a pint of beer with Mr Xi to gesture at the pub near Princess Risborough       Trip to the pub: Prime Minister David Cameron (left) and Chinese President Xi Jinping (right) visit The Plough pub near Princes Risborough              Waving for the cameras: The Plough at Cadsden is a 16th century country inn located in the Chiltern Hills in Buckinghamshire         Leaving: Mr Cameron and Mr Xi leave The Plough at Cadsden yesterday evening after enjoying a traditional fish and chip meal I dropped into The Plough at Cadsden for a pint of IPA and some fish and chips with China's President Xi. pic.twitter.com/6kiY27UBwE— David Cameron (@David_Cameron) October 22, 2015  The pair arrived at the quaint village pub at 6.40pm, after driving the 2.5 miles from the Prime Minister's nearby official residence of Chequers.Other ministers and officials followed Mr Cameron and Mr Xi inside through a second door, including Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond.The Prime Minister, who famously once left daughter Nancy behind at The Plough after an afternoon out, joked with locals about the incident.'I've been in here a few times,' Mr Cameron said. 'I'm not leaving my family here today.'Last night's visit comes two years after Mr Xi famously visited a dumpling shop in Beijing in an apparent attempt to seem more of a man of the people.

     Meanwhile Mr Cameron has presented the President with a commemorative lunar gold coin from the Royal Mint celebrating the Chinese Year of the Sheep to mark his state visit to the UK.And the Camerons also gave Mr Xi and his wife a personalised crystal platter centrepiece from Devon-based Dartington Crystal.Downing Street had earlier kept tight-lipped over speculation that the PM would treat his guests to a visit to a local pub - but they were later spotted at The Plough, near Princes Risborough.It remained unclear whether Mr Cameron would wear his Royal British Legion poppy - purchased just hours earlier - during talks with Xi, after a spat during his 2010 visit to China when his hosts saw the remembrance emblem as an offensive reminder of the 19th century Opium Wars.MPs demanded to know whether Mr Cameron would use the opportunity to raise specific concerns about China's records on human rights, including the detention of lawyer Zhang Kai and other rights defenders. And Tory former minister Tim Loughton questioned why pro-Tibet and free speech protesters were 'corralled' behind barriers while Chinese 'state sponsored cheerleaders' were given prime position to watch Mr Xi being driven up the Mall to meet the Queen.But a joint statement released yesterday had little to say on the issues, with the Prime Minister and President Xi hailing a 'golden era' in their relationship.The document - drawn up after Wednesday's talks between Xi and Mr Cameron at 10 Downing Street - focused on burgeoning economic links, along with the 'global significance and strategic importance of stronger UK-China relations in promoting global peace, stability and prosperity'.It confirmed agreements to refrain from cyber-espionage and to liberalise visa regimes and called for the 'swift' launch of a feasibility study for a China/EU Free Trade Agreement, as well as increasing opportunities for cultural and sporting links, study and tourism.Downing Street said discussions at Chequers would focus on global affairs, with extremism expected to be high on the agenda. China, along with Russia, blocked a series of Western resolutions at the United Nations against Bashar Assad's brutal regime in Syria. The international community is keenly watching how China responds to the fight against Islamic State following Russian military intervention in the conflict-riven country.          Goodbye: Mr Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan bid farewell to Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace         Farewell: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh wave goodbye to Chinese president Xi Jinping and his wife at Buckingham Palace         President Xi views satellite coverage screens in the Network Operation Centre control room of Inmarsat, with CEO Rupert Pearce         Prince Andrew looks on as president Xi is shown behind-the-scenes of the telecommunications company by CEO Rupert Pearce, right         President Xi, left, with Andy Sukawaty, Chairman of Inmarsat, centre, and Prince Andrew, right, on a visit to British telecommunications company Inmarsat, a leading provider of global satellite communication service         President Xi speaks as he attends the opening of the UCL Institute of Education Confucius Institute annual conference in LondonDowning Street said discussions will focus on the 'influence China can bring to the table'. A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said: 'How do we work to tackle extremism, particularly Islamist extremism, make advances on global efforts for a political solution in Syria.'There may be a number of issues they decide they want to take forward and continue in discussion, but I would expect it to focus more on international and foreign affairs.'The Prime Minister will also use the talks to raise concerns over Hong Kong directly with the president, she said. Mr Xi has been accused by democracy campaigners of increasing interference in the running of the former colony.The Queen used the state banquet in Mr Xi's honour at Buckingham Palace to underline former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's vision for 'one country two systems' - an aim that critics fear is being eroded. This afternoon, President Xi joined Prince Andrew to visit Inmersat, a British company that is a leading provider of global satellite communication services. There, the pair were shown views taken from the firm's satellite coverage screens by CEO Rupert Pearce. They later attended a conference Confucius Institute, which aims to promote Chinese language and culture in Britain.    DAVID CAMERON WILL WEAR POPPY DESPITE CHINESE COMPLAINTS  David Cameron has bought a poppy to help launch the Royal British Legion's annual campaign, with Number 10 saying he would wear it 'in the usual way' despite Chinese sensitivities.The Prime Minister received his poppy from wounded veteran Mark Stonelake at a Downing Street reception, placing a £10 note in a collecting tin carried by Corporal Linda Noble and pinning it to his lapel.But the emblem of remembrance risks angering Mr Cameron's Chinese guests, who may see it as an offensive reminder of the Opium Wars fought between Britain and China in the 19th century.Also known as the Anglo-Chinese Wars, they were the climax of trade disputes between China and the British Empire over Chinese attempts to restrict British opium trafficking.China was defeated in both the First Opium War, from 1839 to 1842 and the Second Opium War from 1856 to 1860.               The Prime Minister placed a £10 note in a collecting tin carried by Corporal Linda Noble, left, before pinning the poppy to his lapel, right         Prime Minister David Cameron speaks with Alex Noble and military serving personnel outside Downing StreetDuring his visit to China in 2013, Mr Cameron and his entourage refused a request from Beijing officials to remove their poppies.Mr Cameron is hosting Chinese president Xi Jinping for talks at his Buckinghamshire country retreat Chequers, followed by dinner with wife Samantha and the Chinese First Lady, Peng Liyuan.Number 10 has declined to give details of when he will sport the poppy but his official spokeswoman previously insisted his decision 'will not be swayed by any visitors in town'.Ex-commando Mr Stonelake, who had a leg amputated after being blown up by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan in 2008, was one of several beneficiaries of the legion's work who attended the short ceremony.         The Prime Minister tweeted this photograph, calling on Britons to remember the 'extraordinary service and sacrifice of our Armed Forces'                Goodbye: The Queen and Prince Philip, seen in the doorway behind, escorted Chinese President Xi Jinping outside the palace         Close ties: The Queen, pictured with Prince Philip, celebrated Britain's strong relationship with China in her speech at the state banquet          more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  Harry and Meghan release stunning new photos of their wedding       Watch video  'Wake up': Madonna makes strong political statement at Eurovision       Watch video  Boris Johnson avoids questions about being Tory Prime Minster       Watch video  Theresa May avoids saying Conservatives WILL deliver Brexit           Watch video  'MPs have a stark choice': May prepares for another Brexit vote       Watch video  Police are looking for female who kidnapped child at McDonald's       Watch video  Theresa May agrees to set timetable for her departure from Downing Street       Watch video  Deformed baby cow born with one eye hailed as 'miracle of God'           Watch video  Mike Tindall says he hasn't met baby Archie yet but is 'overjoyed'       Watch video  Amber Rudd is 'not surprised' Boris Johnson wants to be PM       Watch video  Water rushes past a floodgate after it breaks at Lake Dunlap       Watch video  Remainer calls on SNP to 'accept democracy' and respect Brexit result

     On Wednesday, president Xi's schedule focused on business and trade deals between China and Britain. The Government hopes this week's state visit will secure more than £30 billion of trade deals, including huge investments in infrastructure projects.The day started with a touch of glamour. Mr Xi and Madame Peng were greeted by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at an event celebrating the creative collaborations between the two nations. The best of British was put on display at the event, including an outlandish hat by leading British milliner Philip Treacy, a Dalek and Tardis from Doctor Who, and James Bond's Aston Martin. The VIP guests were also treated to a live performance by some of the cast from the hit BBC show Poldark.There was excitement when Chan met the royal couple, with both William and Kate smiling as they posed for a photo alongside their guests. Mr Xi later joined the Prime Minister at Downing Street for a working lunch and talks with Cabinet ministers.          more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  Harry and Meghan release stunning new photos of their wedding       Watch video  'Wake up': Madonna makes strong political statement at Eurovision       Watch video  Boris Johnson avoids questions about being Tory Prime Minster       Watch video  Theresa May avoids saying Conservatives WILL deliver Brexit           Watch video  'MPs have a stark choice': May prepares for another Brexit vote       Watch video  Police are looking for female who kidnapped child at McDonald's       Watch video  Theresa May agrees to set timetable for her departure from Downing Street       Watch video  Deformed baby cow born with one eye hailed as 'miracle of God'           Watch video  Mike Tindall says he hasn't met baby Archie yet but is 'overjoyed'       Watch video  Amber Rudd is 'not surprised' Boris Johnson wants to be PM       Watch video  Water rushes past a floodgate after it breaks at Lake Dunlap       Watch video  Remainer calls on SNP to 'accept democracy' and respect Brexit result

     Top of the agenda was the deal for the China General Nuclear Power Corporation to fund a third of the £18billion cost of the new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset, due to be built by French energy giant EDF.President Xi hailed it a 'flagship deal' which will see China own a third of Britain's first nuclear power plant for a generation. The project also aims to create 1,000 apprenticeships alongside £14million of investment in education and training.Among other initiatives being trumpeted is a £325 million package of partnerships in the creative and technology, including a £50 million deal between Aston Martin and China Equity to develop its zero-emission RapidE sports car.There will also be a big cut in the cost of repeat-visit visas for Chinese tourists in the hope of attracting more high-spending visitors from the fast-expanding Far Eastern economy. Last night, Mr Xi and Madame Peng attended a banquet in the Guildhall, in London's financial district, alongside guests including the Duke of York and the Lord Mayor of London.  MINISTERS FORCE GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD DURING HIGH PROFILE STATE VISIT            Questions: Conservative MP Fiona BruceThe Government has been forced to address China's human rights record in the Commons on the third day of a state visit by president Xi Jinping.Summoned to answer an urgent question by Speaker John Bercow, Foreign Office Minister Hugo Swire insisted no subjects were off the table at talks but told MPs he was not able to give specifics on what Prime Minister David Cameron had raised.Conservative MP Fiona Bruce, who secured the Commons' debate, said the detained human rights lawyer Zhang Kai must be raised directly with president Xi Jinping before the state visit ends.The Chinese visit has been dominated by deals on trade and nuclear power. Mr Xi is visiting Manchester with Chancellor George Osborne before being entertained by Mr Cameron at Chequers. The Chinese delegation is due to leave Britain today.Ms Bruce said: '[Zhang Kai] is one of almost 300 lawyers and human rights defenders detained since July this year. At least 20 are still in custody or have disappeared, whereabouts unknown.'She added: 'As chair of the Conservative party human rights commission, I welcome the opportunity to engage with China. I recognise the significance of the business relationship and the importance of dialogue with China on a whole range of issues, including trade.'But I hope that dialogue on human rights, freedom of thought, speech and assembly and rule of law will also be placed at the centre of this relationship.'It is well recognised promoting such freedoms contribute to better business and economic outcomes for the people involved. The two go hand in hand.'In response, Mr Swire acknowledged 'many MPs will want to find out what was discussed' but stressed 'this state visit is still underway'. He said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn used his meeting with the president as an 'opportunity to discuss these matters'.Mr Swire also pointed to the comments made by Mr Xi at a press conference on Wednesday. In a rare, if carefully controlled, dialogue with foreign journalists, the president said: 'All countries need to continuously improve and strengthen human rights protection to meet the needs of the time and the people and on the issue of human rights I think the people of our respective countries are in the best position to tell.'China is ready to, on the basis of equality and mutual respect, increase exchanges and co-operation with the UK and other countries in the area of human rights.' In his initial statement to MPs, Mr Swire said Britain was in the midst of an 'extremely positive' state visit and said 'extensive talks' between the political leaders took place on Wednesday.Mr Swire said the Government was aware of accusations against Zhang Kai, and was 'concerned' his whereabouts are unknown.He added: 'A transparent legal system is a vital component of the rule of law and we urge the Chinese authorities to ensure proper judicial standards are upheld.'Shadow foreign office minister Catherine West also raised questions about freedom of religion and the guarantees laid down in China's constitution.           more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  Harry and Meghan release stunning new photos of their wedding       Watch video  'Wake up': Madonna makes strong political statement at Eurovision       Watch video  Boris Johnson avoids questions about being Tory Prime Minster       Watch video  Theresa May avoids saying Conservatives WILL deliver Brexit           Watch video  'MPs have a stark choice': May prepares for another Brexit vote       Watch video  Police are looking for female who kidnapped child at McDonald's       Watch video  Theresa May agrees to set timetable for her departure from Downing Street       Watch video  Deformed baby cow born with one eye hailed as 'miracle of God'           Watch video  Mike Tindall says he hasn't met baby Archie yet but is 'overjoyed'       Watch video  Amber Rudd is 'not surprised' Boris Johnson wants to be PM       Watch video  Water rushes past a floodgate after it breaks at Lake Dunlap       Watch video  Remainer calls on SNP to 'accept democracy' and respect Brexit result
