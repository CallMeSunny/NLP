The international community is keenly watching how China responds to the fight against Islamic State following Russian military intervention in the conflict-riven country.Downing Street said discussions will focus on the 'influence China can bring to the table'.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Cyber deal to stop Chinese spying on us: Just because we're...

 A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said: 'How do we work to tackle extremism, particularly Islamist extremism, make advances on global efforts for a political solution in Syria.'There may be a number of issues they decide they want to take forward and continue in discussion, but I would expect it to focus more on international and foreign affairs.'The Prime Minister will also use the talks to raise concerns over Hong Kong directly with the president, she said. Mr Xi has been accused by democracy campaigners of increasing interference in the running of the former colony.The Queen used the state banquet in Mr Xi's honour at Buckingham Palace to underline former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's vision for 'one country two systems' - an aim that critics fear is being eroded.           more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  Harry and Meghan release stunning new photos of their wedding       Watch video  'Wake up': Madonna makes strong political statement at Eurovision       Watch video  Boris Johnson avoids questions about being Tory Prime Minster       Watch video  Theresa May avoids saying Conservatives WILL deliver Brexit           Watch video  'MPs have a stark choice': May prepares for another Brexit vote       Watch video  Police are looking for female who kidnapped child at McDonald's       Watch video  Theresa May agrees to set timetable for her departure from Downing Street       Watch video  Deformed baby cow born with one eye hailed as 'miracle of God'           Watch video  Mike Tindall says he hasn't met baby Archie yet but is 'overjoyed'       Watch video  Amber Rudd is 'not surprised' Boris Johnson wants to be PM       Watch video  Water rushes past a floodgate after it breaks at Lake Dunlap       Watch video  Remainer calls on SNP to 'accept democracy' and respect Brexit result

     Yesterday, president Xi's schedule focused on business and trade deals between China and Britain. The Government hopes this week's state visit will secure more than £30 billion of trade deals, including huge investments in infrastructure projects.The day started with a touch of glamour. Mr Xi and Madame Peng were greeted by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at an event celebrating the creative collaborations between the two nations. The best of British was put on display at the event, including an outlandish hat by leading British milliner Philip Treacy, a Dalek and Tardis from Doctor Who, and James Bond's Aston Martin. The VIP guests were also treated to a live performance by some of the cast from the hit BBC show Poldark.There was excitement when Chan met the royal couple, with both William and Kate smiling as they posed for a photo alongside their guests. Mr Xi later joined the Prime Minister at Downing Street for a working lunch and talks with Cabinet ministers.

     Top of the agenda was the deal for the China General Nuclear Power Corporation to fund a third of the £18billion cost of the new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset, due to be built by French energy giant EDF.President Xi hailed it a 'flagship deal' which will see China own a third of Britain's first nuclear power plant for a generation. The project also aims to create 1,000 apprenticeships alongside £14million of investment in education and training.Among other initiatives being trumpeted is a £325 million package of partnerships in the creative and technology, including a £50 million deal between Aston Martin and China Equity to develop its zero-emission RapidE sports car.There will also be a big cut in the cost of repeat-visit visas for Chinese tourists in the hope of attracting more high-spending visitors from the fast-expanding Far Eastern economy. Last night, Mr Xi and Madame Peng attended a banquet in the Guildhall, in London's financial district, alongside guests including the Duke of York and the Lord Mayor of London.
