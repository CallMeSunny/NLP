 BEIJING, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping hopes China and the United States, the world's two largest economies, will be able to promote a steady and healthy relationship, Chinese state media reported on Thursday. In a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, Xi also said he and Trump hoped to expand bilateral trade cooperation, Xi was quoted as saying on CCTV state television. Xi's comments came after Trump said trade discussions with China were "moving along nicely" and that he planned to meet with Xi at the upcoming G-20 summit, after the two had a "very good" talk. China and the United States are locked in an increasingly bitter trade war, and both countries have already placed tariffs on some of each others' imports.
