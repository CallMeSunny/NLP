That's what Xi said? China state media scolded for typo By Afp   Published: 13:38 BST, 7 December 2015  |  Updated: 13:38 BST, 7 December 2015                e-mail         A Chinese state news agency has suspended four employees, a report said, following a typographical slip that suggested President Xi Jinping was resigning.The error came in a Friday story about a speech Xi gave during a China-Africa summit in Johannesburg last week.Staff at the state-run China News Service switched two Chinese characters with similar sounds, accidentally changing the word in question to write that Xi's remarks were a "resignation" not a "speech", Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
