David Cameron today pledged to confront Chinese leader Xi Jinping over the 'dumping' of cheap steel amid fears of fresh job losses in the crisis-hit industry as another firm went into administration.Speaking in the Commons, the Prime Minister insisted no subjects were 'off the table' during the four-day state visit by the country's strongman president.Unions have warned that one in six steelworkers were facing the prospect of losing their jobs following a series of announcements which have hit steelmaking areas across the UK. Some 5,200 UK steelworkers face redundancy.Scroll down for video               Chinese President Xi Jinping (left) and his wife Peng Liyuan arrived in the UK last night for a four-day state visit hailed by David Cameron (right)The jobs cull started with news that the Thai owners of the Redcar steelworks on Teesside had gone into liquidation with the loss of 2,200 jobs.Tata is expected to announce up to 1,200 job cuts in Scunthorpe and Scotland today, while Caparo went into administration yesterday.Unite said 1,700 jobs were threatened at the firm, owned by Labour Peer Lord Paul, which has plants across the UK, but mainly in the West Midlands.The Prime Minister told Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn: 'Of course, we're doing everything we can in Europe to help our steel industry.

 'That is why we voted in favour of dumping tariffs against the Chinese and we'll do everything we can to help our steel industry, including looking at how we help on high energy usage and the clearances that we need with that.'Will we raise it with the Chinese? Of course, we'll raise all these issues. That is what our relationship with China is all about.'It is at such a high level that there is no subject off the table and all of these issues, including the steel industry, of course will be discussed.'Tony Burke, assistant general secretary at Unite said of the latest job losses were 'yet another hammer blow for steel and manufacturing'.

We will be taking that approach this week.'The spokeswoman also strongly rejected allegations that Mr Cameron was guilty of 'kowtowing' in order to win trade.She said: 'I wouldn't accept that at all. This is about having a relationship based on constructive engagement that enables us to work with China on economic opportunities and opportunities for business.'The spokesman added that this meant Mr Cameron is able to 'talk face-to-face through a whole range of issues including human rights and cyber security'. President Xi's first official visit to London is expected to be marked by protests against human rights abuses and Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to raise the issue in one-to-one talks.But in a clear contrast to growing US concern over China's rise, Mr Cameron has repeatedly hailed the prospect of re-casting Britain's relationship with China.Mr Cameron said there cosying up to China would not harm the UK's close ties with Washington.The Prime Minister said: 'We see no conflict with having that very special relationship, with wanting to be a strong partner for China as the Chinese economy continues to grow and China emerges as an enormous world power.'Mr Cameron said China was now investing more in Britain than in other European countries.In a rare interview, President Xi yesterday praised Britain's 'visionary and strategic' decision to position itself as Beijing's best friend in the west.President Xi will spend four nights in Britain, staying at Buckingham Palace, and flying to Manchester with George Osborne to visit Manchester City Football Club.He is expected to use a speech at Guildhall on Wednesday to set out how he hopes to make London the global centre for offshore Chinese finance.

CHINA'S RICHEST MAN BECOMES AN OFFICIAL ADVISER TO CAMERON    The billionaire founder of China's answer to eBay has joined a panel of business figures advising David Cameron.Jack Ma, believed to be the richest man in China and one of the 20 wealthiest people in the world, will advise the Government on opportunities for British businesses in the far east.Mr Ma, who is executive chairman of Alibaba Group, was meeting Mr Cameron at 10 Downing Street to discuss his new role as Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives for a four-day state visit to the UK.Mr Cameron's spokeswoman said the PM was appointing Mr Ma to his Business Advisory Group to provide 'particular help and advice on how to get small and medium-sized British businesses boosting their exports, in particular accessing Chinese markets through platforms like Alibaba'.The spokeswoman added: 'This is about appointing someone who has real business experience and understanding of the Chinese market.' The visit is expected to see the signing of multi-billion-pound deals for China to invest in replacing Britain's ageing nuclear power plants – despite concerns raised by the security services.The Chinese President has also requested fish and chips for lunch in the countryside on Thursday afternoon. A source told the Sunday Times: 'The Chinese are desperate to order fish and chips. They've asked about it repeatedly.'I don't know if they know something we don't about the Chequers kitchens. It's all part of the president's view of himself as a man of the people.' Mr Corbyn's spokesman said last week that the Labour leader would seek to raise human rights abuses in private meetings, but did not rule out discussing the issue at the dinner.The Treasury hopes to make China Britain's second largest trade partner within a decade, and this week may see 150 deals signed – including on healthcare, aircraft manufacturing and energy. The last Chinese state visit was in 2005, when hundreds of campaigners protested over its poor human-rights record. Amnesty International said China executes more people than any other nation – potentially thousands a year – while freedom of expression is limited and activists face harassment and arbitrary detention.Mr Osborne raised human rights privately during his visit to Beijing, and British officials say the delegation can expect 'robust' discussion behind the scenes this week.         The PM has also been forced to deny that the new 'golden era' of relations with China will not damage Britain's special relationship with the US  PRINCE WILLIAM TO APPEAR ON CHINESE TV TO PLEAD FOR AN END TO WILDLIFE POACHING  Prince William has recorded a special message on illegal wildlife trade for Chinese television ahead of this week's official state visit.The Duke of Cambridge's message to China will be filmed in front of a studio-style audience of students and guests at the Maughan Library at King's College London.It will be broadcast on the Chinese state TV channel CCTV1.Prince William raised the issue with Mr Xi when they met in Beijing earlier this year and his broadcast will form part of a series of programmes called Let's Talk.The Duke will also meet Sir David Attenborough, basketball player Yao Ming and TV presenter Bear Grylls at the university.   Prince Charles declined to attend the state banquet but, in an unusual move, he has invited Mr Xi and his wife to tea at Clarence House. The private meeting would give the Prince, who is long-standing friends with exiled Tibetan leader the Dalai Lama, a chance to raise concerns over human rights.Ahead of his trip, Mr Xi praised Britain for promising be 'the Western country that is most open to China'.He said: 'This is a visionary and strategic choice that fully meets Britain's own long-term interest. China looks forward to engaging with the UK in a wider range, at a higher level and in greater depth.'Thursday's lunch is not the first time Mr Cameron has used pub diplomacy to win over a visiting world leader.In January last year the PM took French President Francois Holllande to The Swan Inn in his Witney constituency, which has featured in Downton Abbey.But it did not all go to plan, with Mr Hollande brushing aside British demands for reform of the EU before being seen sprinting out of the pub door to his waiting car.Mr Cameron has brushed aside concerns about British attempts to woo the Chinese, insisting the UK's status as a 'leading member of the EU' helps it attract investment from China.The Prime Minister cited the importance of the UK's involvement in the union in an interview ahead of the state visit by Chinese president Xi Jinping next week.   Battle of the first ladies: Understated Sam Cam to go head-to-head with Chinese president's flamboyant wife Peng Liyuan in historic visit... but who will be style leader? By Phoebe Jackson-Edwards For MailOnlineOne was born into privilege while the other experienced abject poverty, but Samantha Cameron and the Chinese first lady Peng Liyuan's paths will collide for the first time this week. The President of China, Xi Jinping, will be meeting David Cameron in a week-long state visit and his wife Peng, 52, who has stolen the hearts of the Chinese public, will be with him.So how do the glamorous wives of the two premiers compare? And who will be drawing the most admiring glances during the hotly-anticipated visit? FEMAIL takes a look.               Peng Liyuan is China's biggest singer and married to President Xi Jinping, she will meet Samantha Cameron for the first time tomorrowSTYLE Samantha Cameron, 44, may have enjoyed a quietly illustrious life but she has only seen her star ascend as a fashionista since her husband became Conservative leader 10 years ago.Meanwhile, Peng has broken the mould of Chinese leader's wives being frumpy by becoming a beauty and fashion icon.The first lady's style has sparked a stampede of fashion followers in China with her simple but glamorous look.Her trademark look of a single string of pearls with a mandarin-collared jacket has inspired many women to copy her style. Peng has often been seen wearing Ma Ke, a designer from southern China who creates bold architectural designs.                  Peng Liyuan, pictured performing in 2007, wears daring designs and has seen her trademark style copied across China by fans            Samantha attended the Roksanda show during London Fashion Week, sat with Caroline Rush and Natalie MassenetOn her first outing in Moscow, Peng wore an elegant dark coat with a leather handbag, both designed by Ma.Samantha rarely puts a foot wrong with her outfit choices, which saw her top Vanity Fair's best dressed list this year.She has a fashion formula which she sticks to, usually plumping for bold printed or bright coloured dresses with a high neck for political engagements.Bold coloured heels pep up a plainer outfit and she always belts up to emphasise her slim waist.Samantha doesn't snub the high street and wore a £150 coral midi-dress to the Tory Party conference this month.Mixing the likes of Erdem and Philip Lim with high-street favourites like Zara which she 'loves' COS and Uniqlo which she chooses for cashmere.Samantha is an ambassador for the British Fashion Council and lent her support to many designers at London Fashion Week.She has championed British designers such as Roksanda Ilincic, whose show she was seen sat on the FROW for, Osman Yousefzada and Erdem.       BACKGROUND But the first ladies' effect on the fashion landscape of their countries is where their similarities end.While Samantha was born into high society, according to the Chinese government Peng was brought up in abject poverty.Samantha is the daughter of Sir Reginald Sheffield, the 8th Baronet and descended from King Charles II, and said to be worth £20millionIt's no surprise blue-blooded Samantha has become a supporter of the Conservatives as her great-grandfather Sir Berkeley Sheffield was an MP for the party.Given a privileged start in life, she grew up in the 300-acre estate Normanby Hall in Lincolnshire, near Scunthorpe, and her family also owns a large Yorkshire estate called Sutton Park.It's a sharp contrast to Peng's upbringing during Chairman Mao's era in the village of Peng in Shandong Province, where she was born in 1962. Her father was a lowly official, a schoolmaster who was put in charge of the county Culture bureau. He earned 40 yuan (£4) a month. There's little recorded about her mother, who was 25 when she was born and a member of a small touring opera company.When she was four, Red guards arrived at her house to denounce her family and her mother was called a spy for having relatives in Taiwan. Her father was made to clean public lavatories for promoting culture that was suddenly considered 'feudal', a vestige of old China.               Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan visit California in June 2013, with Peng sporting her trademark mandarin-style top. Samantha sports horizontal stripes at the Conservative party annual conferenceEDUCATION While Samantha attended the School of St Helen and St Katharine, an independent school in Oxfordshire which now costs £4,730 per term, Peng was refused an education.But the singer had her voice to fall back on.She quickly learned to sing patriotic songs and travelled alone for 50 miles to to take the exam, only to be confronted with instruments and sheet music which she'd never seen before.But her singing voice secured her a place at a provincial art school, beating 10,000 other applicants.Her career quickly raced upwards and she was picked for the elite performance troupe of the local People's Liberation Army at 18.By 23, she was the most popular singer in China. In 1983, she performed on the most watched television show in the world, China's New Year's Eve Gala and travelled the country dressed in her green army uniform.Samantha finished school and took her A Levels at Marlborough College.She went on to study Fine Art at the Bristol School of Creative Arts and has worked her way up from window dresser to creative director of the luxury label Smythson.She designed two of the brand's best-selling bags.       HOW THEY MET THEIR HUSBANDSIt was while at Marlborough College she found herself meeting her husband. Samantha was friends with David's sister Clare and first met him at the Cameron residence aged 16.But after finishing university, she was invited on a family holiday to Tuscany, Italy, with the Camerons and a holiday romance blossomed.The couple married in June 1996 at the Church of St. Augustine of Canterbury, Oxfordshire, five years before David became an MP.The relationship between Peng and the Chinese Prime Minister flourished much quicker.In 1986 Peng met Xi Jinping, whose first marriage had fallen apart, on a blind date.Then a mid-ranking official, he set his sites on Peng immediately.It's not clear when she fell for Xi as conflicting reports claim she fell for him instantly because of his strong ideas, while another account claims he did not know her singing career and she felt he was a country bumpkin. The couple married the following year and had a daughter, Xi Mingze, who graduated from Harvard University last year.              MARRIAGE Peng is known as a power player in her own country and it looks like she wears the trousers in their relationship.In a clip which ran the gauntlet of the internet, she was seen giving her husband a stern look at the Asia-Pacific summit in Beijing last year.President Xi was not waving but with one glance from his wife, he started frantically waving. When her husband once remarked her didn't like her lipstick, she told him to stick to politics. While Samantha has a more relaxed view on her marriage and has said that her husband runs the country while she runs the house.Samantha said she does the school run with their three children Nancy, 11, Arthur, 9 and Florence, 5.Recent rumours in a new biography titled Call Me Dave don't appear to have shaken the couple. Allegations about their marriage are said to be included in the book which Samantha has vigorously denied.  It comes weeks after the first extract was released, making explosive claims that the Prime Minister took part in a bizarre initiation ceremony while at Oxford University.However, the book's ghost writer, ex-reporter Isabel Oakeshott, has admitted that there is no solid evidence that the incident occurred. There have been no such scandals for Peng and her husband, which could be down to the rigorous regulation of the Chinese media.  But she did hint that she missed her old life of obscurity. She said: 'I love being a housewife and cycling to the market to buy vegetable.'Sometimes they say I look like Peng Liyuan.'   BRITISH SPIES TO MONITOR SECURITY AT NEW NUCLEAR PLANTS BUILT BY THE CHINESE AMID FEARS THEY COULD BE USED TO THREATEN THE UK    British spies will monitor cyber security at a series of new nuclear power stations built by the Chinese amid fears they could be used to threaten the UK.The government's cyber spy centre GCHQ will take the lead role protecting Britain's energy network from online attacks, it was confirmed today.The revelation comes ahead of a four-day state visit to Britain by the Chinese President Xi Jinping.         Britain's spy centre GCHQ confirmed it has been charged with protecting national security at the nuclear plantsDavid Cameron has hailed the visit as the start of a 'golden era' in Britain's relationship with Beijing.A series of deals with China are set to be struck over during the visit – starting tonight - with the first project likely to be at Hinkley Point, Somerset.Under a proposed deal, China will join the French energy giant EDF in building nuclear plants at Hinkley Point and Sizewell, Suffolk.China will also be given the unprecedented opportunity to design and build its own nuclear facility at Bradwell, Essex.However, British security chiefs have expressed concerns to ministers about the decision to ask Chinese companies with links to the country's military to take a stake in three nuclear power plants.The country is still seen as a serious threat to British interests - especially in cyber spying.Security sources have warned that 'trapdoors' could be installed in software used to run the nuclear power plants which could enable Beijing to seize control of them if diplomatic relationships were to break down.But GCHQ confirmed it has been charged with protecting national security at the nuclear plants.A spokesman told the Times: 'GCHQ has a remit to support the cybersecurity of private-sector-owned critical national infrastructure projects, including in the civil nuclear sector and nuclear new builds, when invited to do so by the lead government department involved.'
