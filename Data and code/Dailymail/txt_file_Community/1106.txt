China's Xi arrives in Prague en route to the US By Associated Press   Published: 17:02 BST, 28 March 2016  |  Updated: 17:03 BST, 28 March 2016                e-mail         PRAGUE (AP) — Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in the Czech Republic on Monday for a visit aimed at boosting economic and political ties, a visit that's prompted protesters to fly the Tibetan flag along a key stretch of road to downtown Prague.Xi's visit — his only stopover in Europe before flying to the U.S. — is a result of a more business-oriented Czech approach to China than the one that prevailed under the late President Vaclav Havel, a prominent proponent of human rights. President Milos Zeman was the only European Union leader to attend China's celebrations of the end of World War II.Zeman has come under fire for telling Chinese state-run broadcaster CCTV that relations between the two countries had suffered in the past because Czech foreign policy had been overly pressured by the United States and the EU.
