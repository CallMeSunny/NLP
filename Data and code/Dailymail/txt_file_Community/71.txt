Myanmar counts ballots after Suu Kyi's day of destiny By Afp   Published: 00:26 BST, 9 November 2015  |  Updated: 00:27 BST, 9 November 2015                e-mail         Vote counting in Myanmar's landmark election was well underway Monday following a massive turnout that could see Aung San Suu Kyi's party catapulted to power and the end of decades of military control.Millions had queued the previous day to cast their ballots in an event heavy with history and filled with emotion.As the count began in earnest, early indications were of an "80 percent" turnout, according to Union Election Commission deputy director Thant Zin Aung -- a figure the opposition believe favours their bid for a majority.
