Marcelo Bielsa conceded his Leeds team had taken a potentially fatal blow in their Premier League promotion quest despite 'destiny giving them a hand' against relegation-threatened Wigan.Gifted a numerical advantage by a contentious double-jeopardy decision by referee Scott Duncan to send off Cedric Kipre for an alleged handball on the goal line when awarding an early penalty, Leeds failed to capitalise over the next 75 minutes.Although Patrick Bamford atoned for Pablo Hernandez's hitting of the woodwork from 12 yards a matter of seconds later, Gavin Massey's clinical brace either side of half-time left Leeds behind Sheffield United on goal difference in the tussle for second place, and with the Argentinian Bielsa admitting they faced 'a new reality' following an extraordinary afternoon.         Gavin Massey headed in from close range to score the visitor's second goal at Elland Road         Massey's second goal sparked wild scenes from the Wigan coaching staff on the touchline         Wigan were reduced to 10 men after just 14 minutes with Cedric Kipre seeing a straight red         Pablo Hernandez saw his spot kick saved in the first half after Kipre conceded the penalty       Patrick Bamford scored the opener for Leeds shortly after Hernandez's penalty miss   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Sheffield United 2-0 Nottingham Forest: Mark Duffy and Enda...

   With the Championship's staggered Easter fixtures, they could find themselves three points behind by the time they kick off at Brentford on Monday evening.'Today only one thing had to happen - we had to win. There is no explanation for this loss,' Leeds coach Bielsa said.'This is a very serious wound in the worst moment. We will heal this wound only by getting promoted.'We arrived in this moment with all the credentials to get promoted and the games we have left are going to be a lot more demanding than the ones we've had.'If there's a team that's been unlucky it's our team. In all the games, or at least 90 per cent of the games. Today though everything went in our favour to take advantage. Destiny gave us a hand.'

      No Leeds manager in a debut season can better the 25 league victories Bielsa has tallied and he appeared on course for number 26 in the quest to end the club's 15-year exile from the top flight when a Wigan team with the division's poorest away record were struck by adversity early on.Leeds' stand-in captain Luke Ayling's mishit shot bobbled beyond the far post, from where Patrick Bamford applied a far superior connection only for Kipre to block on the goal line.The 34,000 Elland Road crowd screamed 'goal' but Duncan adjudged Kipre had kept it out via the use of his arm and produced the red card. Kipre walked off, gesticulating that he had been struck in the chest.With regular penalty taker Kemar Roofe on the bench, Pablo Hernandez grabbed the ball, only to suffer the same fate as Bamford here last month, beating the outstanding Christian Walton's dive but striking the base of the post.         Leeds manager Marcelo Bielsa looks concerned as he watches on from the touchline          Bamford tries to guide his header on target as Wigan's Cheyenne Dunkley challenges him         Leeds supporters look nervous in the stands during Friday afternoon's matchNot that the disappointment lingered long. Within a couple of minutes, the all-action Ayling threaded a pass into the stride of Bamford, who arrowed a right-foot shot into the far corner.'The first thought in my mind was how many we could keep it down to?' Revealed jubilant Wigan manager Paul Cook.'But if we were going to get beat, we wanted to get beat on our shield.'At 1-0 down, and Rotherham winning at Swansea, Wigan found themselves in the drop zone for the first time all season.Their response was astonishing. Cook gambled, leaving two strikers to carry a forward threat. It almost paid dividends when Leon Clarke seized upon an anaemic back pass from Gaetano Berardi, and rounded the advancing Kiko Casilla, only to chip wide from 30 yards.         Leeds' Jack Clarke looks to cross the ball into the box as Antonee Robinson tries to block it         Luke Ayling shows his frustration after Leeds suffer a shock defeat against Wigan on Friday         Wigan players celebrate after claiming three vital points in their battle to beat the dropLeeds did not heed the warning, as a minute before the interval, the unmarked Massey made good Lee Evans' pass at the far post.Then, what felt like a hammer blow was delivered just after the hour as Clarke, the striker on loan from Sheffield United, headed down a raking cross from Nathan Byrne and Massey nodded in his second to stony silence.Events had taken on an entirely different direction to those anticipated in pre-match when a light aircraft flew over head with a message which read 'Bielsa is God.'Suddenly, his team's mortality was being felt against opponents with just one previous win on the road this season and frustrations boiled over - Leeds are looking into objects being thrown into the Wigan penalty area from the south stand during the tense finale.At the final whistle, Leeds players sunk to the turf while the Wigan bench huddled in a celebration that suggested their drop fears are nearly over. Their efforts have opened up a five-point buffer.'There are no givens in the Championship, as we've just seen,' said Cook.
