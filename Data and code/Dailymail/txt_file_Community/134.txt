For the first time since December 7, Liverpool do not have their destiny in their own hands when it comes to the Premier League title race.That was the last time their title rivals Manchester City were ahead of them with both teams having played the same number of fixtures.After a weekend that saw City win 1-0 at Bournemouth and Liverpool held goalless by Everton in the Merseyside derby, Pep Guardiola's side lead by a point with nine games left to play.It means that Liverpool are now relying on City dropping points between now and the final day of the season on May 12 if they are to win a first championship since 1990.We chart, week-by-week, where both title contenders could slip up during what promises to be a thrilling finale. All fixtures listed are subject to change          Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool no longer have their title destiny in their own hands after Sunday's goalless draw with Everton, which saw them fall a point behind rivals Manchester City         Manchester City came away from Bournemouth with a precious three points on Saturday         With nine matches remaining, City are in the box seat with a one-point lead over Liverpool          RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Now Romelu Lukaku must prove he can shoot down top sides......

     MARCH 9/10Saturday March 9 - Man City vs Watford (5.30pm); Sunday March 10 - Liverpool vs Burnley (12pm)A weekend that should see both City and Liverpool pick up maximum points to preserve the present one-point gap.City are highly likely to move four points clear on the Saturday evening when they host Watford, though the Hornets are enjoying a very good season and may take a little bit of breaking down.Liverpool have the opportunity to respond when they host Burnley at Anfield on the Sunday lunchtime and it's hard to imagine them gaining anything less than maximum returns.Prediction: 1st Man City 74pts; 2nd Liverpool 73pts  MARCH 17Fulham vs Liverpool (2.15pm)With City travelling to Swansea in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, Liverpool have the opportunity to re-take top spot.They travel to a Fulham side who look pretty much certain to be relegated and this should be a comfortable three points for Jurgen Klopp's men.Prediction: 1st Liverpool 76pts; 2nd Man City 74pts - City have a game in hand         Mohamed Salah takes on Fulham's Maxime Le Marchand during their meeting at Anfield   MARCH 30/31Saturday March 30 - Fulham vs Man City (12.30pm); Sunday March 31 - Liverpool vs Tottenham Hotspur (4.30pm)It's pretty much a dead cert that Pep Guardiola's side will bounce straight back to the top after the international break with their own win at Fulham on the Saturday lunchtime.Liverpool face the much tougher test of the weekend when they entertain Spurs on the Sunday afternoon and though Mauricio Pochettino's men aren't as in-form as they could be, they could well pinch a draw.At this point, City's superior goal difference will see them top.Prediction: 1st Man City 77pts; 2nd Liverpool 77pts - City have a game in hand         Liverpool's Naby Keita and Tottenham's Harry Kane during the Reds' 2-1 win at Wembley  APRIL 5/6Friday April 5 - Southampton vs Liverpool (8pm); Saturday April 6 - Man City vs Cardiff (12.30pm)There is every chance City will be involved in a FA Cup semi-final this weekend but for the sake of simplicity, let's say they're in league action as originally scheduled.Liverpool play first over this weekend, and should take all three points off Southampton at St Mary's.But expect their advantage to again be short-lived, with City giving their goal difference a healthy boost against Cardiff on the Saturday lunchtime.Prediction: 1st Man City 80pts; 2nd Liverpool 80pts - City have a game in hand  APRIL 14Crystal Palace vs Manchester City (2.05pm); Liverpool vs Chelsea (4.30pm)This could well prove the pivotal afternoon in the title race, with the games also coming right between a potential Champions League quarter-final for both teams.You'd expect City to come away from Selhurst Park with all three points though it promises to be far from an easy assignment. Liverpool know all about throwing away titles at Palace, after all.Then comes a blockbuster clash between Liverpool and Chelsea. With all the pressure on the Reds to respond, you can see them dropping two points against Maurizio Sarri's side, who will be fighting for a top-four finish.Prediction: 1st Man City 83pts; 2nd Liverpool 81pts - City have a game in hand         Daniel Sturridge scored a last-minute equaliser when Liverpool played Chelsea in September  APRIL 20/21Saturday April 20 - Man City vs Tottenham Hotspur (12.30pm); Sunday April 21 - Cardiff vs Liverpool (4.30pm)Tottenham have another opportunity to affect the outcome of the title race when they travel to the Etihad Stadium on the Saturday lunchtime.However, they have a poor record there in recent years and you can't see anything other than a City win, albeit by a narrow margin.This will put City five points ahead and still with a game in hand, but expect Liverpool to maintain the pressure with a comfortable win at Cardiff on the Sunday.Prediction: 1st Man City 86pts; 2nd Liverpool 84pts - City have a game in hand  APRIL 24Man United vs Man City (8pm)This is City's game in hand from the FA Cup quarter-final weekend but it's a tough one - a trip across the city to rivals United.This raises the intriguing scenario of Liverpool needing a favour from their bitter rivals United on order to win the league.Regardless of United's resurgence, you'd imagine City will come away with a point to maintain their cushion at the top.But if United did win and do Liverpool a favour, it'd be a really dramatic finish.  Prediction: 1st Man City 87pts; 2nd Liverpool 84pts         Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's Man United will have a big say in who finishes first and who is second  APRIL 26/28Friday April 26 - Liverpool vs Huddersfield Town (8pm); Sunday April 28 - Burnley vs Man City (2.05pm)Another Friday night assignment for Liverpool and one you'd imagine they'll deal with easily, racking up a few goals against Huddersfield to move level on points with City.The Sunday sees a potentially tricky visit to Burnley for Guardiola's team. But though it will be a test of their mettle, they should scrape through to keep on track for the title.Prediction: 1st Man City 90pts; 2nd Liverpool 87pts  MAY 4Exact times to be confirmed - Man City vs Leicester; Newcastle vs LiverpoolThe penultimate weekend of the season and Liverpool could easily find themselves needing snookers to get themselves back to the top.City are at home to Leicester and you can only really see one outcome. Liverpool have the tougher fixture away at Newcastle but should have enough to take it to the final day.Prediction: 1st Man City 93pts; 2nd Liverpool 90pts         Xherdan Shaqiri celebrates his goal in Liverpool's 4-0 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day  MAY 12Brighton vs Man City (3pm); Liverpool vs Wolves (3pm)The title rests in the balance on the final afternoon of the season, with all the teams playing simultaneously.On paper, City have the easier match, away at Brighton, and you can't see them dropping any points. And even if they do, they may well have a buffer to fall back on.Liverpool have a far from simple game against Wolves at Anfield and though they should win, it could well be too late as City retain their title and lift the trophy at the Amex.Final table prediction: 1st Man City 96pts; 2nd Liverpool 93pts.         Will it be City lifting the Premier League trophy for the second successive year come May?
