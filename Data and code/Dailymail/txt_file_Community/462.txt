 The young prince’s concerns fortunately have nothing to do with the thorny royal issue of marriage, but they are potentially life changing.For while many royal watchers feverishly speculate as to whether he and Kate intend to start a family together, the biggest question mark at the top of William’s list this week is actually whether to continue with his RAF career – a decision which has been hugely complicated by the recent illness of his beloved grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh.It is difficult to convey just how much the prince loves his job as a search and rescue Sea King pilot, and the difference it has made to his outlook on life.      June 1982: The Prince and Princess of Wales showing off their son William to the media for the first time. he was only a day old when this picture was taken      December 1982: Aged six months, the young prince sits on his father's lap as his first Christmas approaches        March 1983: William, aged nine months, smiles for the camera as he plays at home in Kensington Palace, London                 March 1983: William, aged nine months, is pictured sitting with his proud parents in Kensington Palace, London, in these family portraits   As one confidante explains: ‘It is a core part of who he is. The confidence and contentment he has gained from his career has seeped into every aspect of his life.’Another adds: ‘I honestly believe it is no exaggeration to say that his career satisfaction was in a large way responsible for his decision to finally pop the question to Kate. All of a sudden, the pieces of the jigsaw finally slotted together’.For behind the controls of his helicopter (last week it was announced that William had qualified to captain his aircraft), the prince is just another, anonymous member of the armed forces. Indeed, many of those he rescues – from walkers on Snowdonia to stranded sailors in the Irish Sea – have no idea that a future king has just saved their life.And having initially been desperately disappointed to be barred from frontline military service because of his position as a direct heir to the throne, that’s just how William prefers it. Sadly for the prince, however, the clock is ticking and his first, three-year tour of duty is due to end next spring.      December 1983: William, aged 17 months, shows he has learned to walk in this colour photograph       June 1984: William, pictured nine days before his second birthday, enjoys a summer's day with his parents in the garden of Kensington Palace                  Early years: William kicks a ball around the walled garden of Kensington Palace in June 1984 (left) and prepares to board the Royal Yacht Britannia at Southampton Docks to sail for the Western Isles with his parents and brother Harry in August 1985 (right)  He has to tell his superiors by the end of this year whether he wants to continue flying and is, as we speak, ‘very seriously’ weighing up his options.His gut instinct is to jump at the chance both because he loves it, and because he appreciates he is being the opportunity to lead a so-called normal life that few of his predecessors - his father included - have ever been given.Indeed, sources close to the prince are at pains to stress that neither the Queen nor Charles are putting ‘any pressure on him whatsoever’, and insist that he must do what is best for himself and for Kate.But in his more realistic moments, William himself is the first to admit that ‘the pressures of my other life are building.’His 91-year-old grandfather’s two recent bouts of ill health – his heart surgery before Christmas and his recent hospitalisation after a bladder infection – have rammed home the unpalatable truth that the senior members of his family are not getting any younger, and it is time for a glamorous new generation to step into the fray.‘Given the chance, he would like to continue with his work,’ says a friend. ‘But you shouldn’t assume that he will chose to stay in it, as other factors are most definitely coming into play.      September 1985: Holding on to his mother's hand, William arrives for his first day at school                   Growing up: William gets a rub on the head from his mother on his first day at school in Notting Gate, London, in September 1985 (left) and sits on her lap (right) as they watch Charles play polo at Smith's Lawn, Windsor in May 1987 ‘He has got to get the balance right between his flying and his royal duties. It is a niggling sore for him.‘It is true that the Queen and the Prince of Wales are both incredibly supportive of his career and whatever decision he makes. They have made clear that it is a decision he and his wife have got to take together. He is very torn.’My sources say that one of the others factors the prince is weighing up is his home on Anglesey, the island in North Wales, which has given himself and Kate the relative peace and anonymity they crave.If he decides to take all or part of a new 36-month tour of duty, then he will almost certainly have to transfer to a new base in a different part of the country – very possibly Lossiemouth in remote, northern Scotland. Do he and his wife have the stomach to start again? Particularly, of course, if the couple do have a child in the immediate future, as they have both indicated they are keen to do.      July 1991: William stands with his mother in the Royal Box on Centre Court at Wimbledon, as Steffi Graf wins the Women's Singles Championship Poor Kate, who turned 30 in January, finds herself subjected to daily scrutiny over her figure and potential ‘baby bump’. Her private office at St James’s Palace have made clear that they will not speculate on the issue, and if and when there is anything to say, an announcement will be made.Friends of the prince say they think it is unlikely the pair would try for a baby before their upcoming Diamond Jubilee tour of Malaysia, Singapore, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu – a gruelling ten-day tour in September that is likely to tire even those in the rudest of health.And, like many military wives, Kate might find it a challenge starting a family in a strange town far away from her nearest and dearest. She admits that she ‘worries terribly’ whenever her husband is out on a mission.But, friends also shrug ruefully, who knows with William? He is a prince who revels in playing his cards close to his chest.The royal flyer also has to consider the potential public backlash that ‘jacking in’ his career at such an early stage could spark, particularly given the £800,000 of public money it took to train him.His pilot’s training course was even given its own, slightly ostentatious codename - Golden Osprey.But at least, unlike his father who turned 30 very much as a single man hankering after the one woman he seemingly could never have, William is settled domestically.He is, say his friends, ‘absurdly proud’ of the way in which Kate has ‘found her feet’ as a member of the royal family, and the confidence with which she is now tackling her work – not, they stress, that William ever doubted her.The couple will, for the time being at least, continue to conduct the vast majority of their jobs as a couple and ‘very much see themselves as a team’.Kate is a hugely nurturing figure in William’s life who cooks his dinner, runs their house and shares his interests in walking, biking and countryside pursuits.      September 1997: William (second left) walks with Prince Philip (left), Earl Althorp (centre), Harry (second right) and Charles (right) behind the cortege at his mother's funeral       September 1997: William (left) and Harry bow their heads as their mother's coffin is taken out of Westminster Abbey following the funeral service Not the most contemporary of relationships it must be said but then, for all their bluster about modernisation, in many aspects the Royal Family remain fairly Victorian in their ways. And Kate sees herself very much as a ‘military wife’ first and foremost.The couple will continue to conduct on average just one engagement a week (and many are clustered together with long periods of purdah in between), and have no other foreign trips planned outside of their September tour.Aside of that and the Olympics, during which he and Kate will enjoy roles as official ambassadors for Team GB, the couple are desperately hoping to keep their heads down.Boring, you might ask? Well, it certainly wouldn’t be far wrong to suggest that William and Kate aren’t in line to win an award for party animals of the year.Box sets feature prominently in their Anglesey life (Danish murder series The Killing and American thriller 24 have been recent favourites), and their last big night out in London was to watch The Avengers film at their local cinema in Kensington.                Becoming a man: William varnishes the outside of a local radio station in the village of Tortel, Southern Chile, during a Raleigh International expedition in December 2000 (left) and shares a joke with his father on the Madrisa ski slopes, above the Swiss village of Klosters, in March 2004 (right) After a busy weekend Trooping The Colour, playing charity polo and an appearance at the Garter ceremony at Windsor on Monday, William and his wife headed to Highgrove.Aides insists there will be no great party, no nightclubs and definitely no public appearances to celebrate his birthday.All this week, William and Kate have been staying at Prince Charles’s country residence, as the prince has been on an RAF course in Gloucestershire.Tonight, the couple will enjoy what sources describe as a ‘low key’ birthday meal with Kate’s family and some close friends. His circle are equally keen to play down William’s overnight metamorphosis into an independently wealthy young man, with an estimated £10million coming to him today in the last tranche of his late mother’s will.      May 2003: The prince relaxes midway through his four-year degree course at St Andrew's University                University days: William plays pool with friends (left) in November 2004 at a bar in St Andrews, where he met his future wife Kate. The couple are pictured (right) during a visit to Blachford Lake near Yellowknife in Canada in July 2011        June 2005: William departs St Andrews police station after his graduation ceremony. He achieved a 2:1 in geography after four years studying for his Master of Arts                  Serving his country: William smiles as he and other graduates are inspected by his grandmother, The Queen, in the Sovereign's parade at Sandhurst in December 2006 (left). He began a two-month attachment with the Royal Navy in June 2008 (right) ‘There’s talk of buying another bike [superbikes are an unusually racy passion for the prince] and there are always holidays but I honestly can’t see it changing his life in the slightest. He and Catherine lead surprisingly low-key lives,’ one member insisted.Still, as he weighs up whether to embrace a new life as a professional ribbon cutter in the next few months, it’s just how the future king likes it.For as he turns 30, William, we are finding, is something of a rare royal breed: marrying centuries of tradition with the sensibilities of a thoroughly 21st century prince.It is something that the public clearly would like to see more of, if the soaring popularity polls are to be believed. Whether he is ready to give it to them yet remains to be seen.
