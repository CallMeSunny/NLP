Chinese president Xi Jinping left a bitter war of words after his visit to Britain last week – after using his Buckingham Palace speech to savage Japan for its wartime record.At a State Banquet on Tuesday, the Chinese leader repeatedly broke protocol. To an audience that included Japan’s ambassador, Xi said 2015 marked the 70th anniversary of the ‘war of resistance against Japanese aggression’.Relations have been worsened by a current dispute over islands in the East China Sea, which both countries claim.Scroll down for video          President Xi, centre, outraged Tokyo leaders after he spoke about the 70th anniversary of the 'war of resistance against Japanese aggression' during a speech at the State Banquet in his honour on Tuesday The speech drew a withering response from the Japanese Embassy which, in a statement to The Mail on Sunday, pointed out that Japan was democratic, in contrast to one-party China.‘Japan is a different country from 70 years ago, a close friend of the UK, and will continue to contribute to the peace and prosperity of the world,’ it said.

 Xi’s speech was also attacked in Japan as an attempt to detract attention from China’s human rights record.Yoichi Shimada, a professor at Fukui Prefectural University, said: ‘The vast majority of British people are aware that one of the biggest abusers of human rights in the world today is Xi’s China.’         Guests at the State Banquet were treated to Turbot fillets, Scottish venison  and vintage port from 1977
