Xi rebukes Japan for brutality in China, Koreas By Associated Press   Published: 09:18 BST, 4 July 2014  |  Updated: 09:18 BST, 4 July 2014                e-mail         SEOUL, South Korea (AP) â€” Chinese President Xi Jinping has highlighted Japan's brutality against China and South Korea in the last century amid worries in both countries about recent nationalism in Tokyo.Japan colonized the Korean Peninsula and occupied parts of China, often brutally, before and during World War II. Many elderly people in China and South Korea still harbor strong resentment against Japan.Earlier this week, Japan's government approved a reinterpretation of its pacifist postwar constitution that allows its military a larger international role.Xi said in a speech in Seoul on Friday that China and Korea had "big suffering" when the Japanese militarists launched "barbarous" aggression on them in the first half of the 20th century. He spoke through an interpreter.Xi came to South Korea on Thursday for a two-day trip.
