China sees backlash to graft-busting 'tiger' hunt By Afp   Published: 13:03 BST, 12 June 2015  |  Updated: 13:04 BST, 12 June 2015                e-mail         The jailing of China’s former security chief Zhou Yongkang marks the highest point of a corruption crackdown pushed by President Xi Jinping, but efforts appear to be slowing with analysts citing opposition from officials.Sentenced to life in prison on Thursday, Zhou was once arguably China's third most powerful man, in charge of the country's police, courts and secret service when he retired in 2012.The prosecution of such a figure shows Xi has consolidated a formidable power base in the ruling Communist party since he became its head in the same year.
