         Yakub Memon met his family for 40 minutes at Nagpur’s central prisonYakub Memon appeared to resign himself to fate on Wednesday soon after learning that the Supreme Court bench had upheld his death warrant.Later, he spent 40 minutes consoling his family at Nagpur’s central prison, asking them to submit to ‘naseeb’. The 1993 blasts convict, who will be hanged at 6am on Thursday, was shifted in the small hours to the ‘condemned cell’, where he was out of sight of other prisoners and is supposed to mentally prepare himself for his final moments. At 4am, a magistrate was scheduled to visit and ask him if he admitted to his guilt. According to sources in the Nagpur jail, the apex court’s decision was conveyed to Yakub shortly after his lunch. But he didn’t appear perturbed or agitated throughout the afternoon, they said. “Yakub did not lose composure, perhaps giving in to destiny. It seemed he was prepared for the worst. He patiently heard about the verdict and then retired to his cell,” the sources added. When jail authorities offered to allow his family to meet him for ‘mulaqat’ on Wednesday evening, Yakub agreed. In the evening, Yakub’s wife, daughter and brother met him for the last time in a special room inside the jail. The last meeting between Yakub and family was understandably an emotional affair. While the family members could not control their emotions, Yakub - who appeared somewhat shaken then - tried to maintain his composure and consoled them. “They were left inside the room, but under watch,” the sources said. Yakub was later subjected to a medical test and found mentally and physically fit, police sources said. After this, a Bomb Detection & Disposal Squad was sent to sanitise the place. Speaking about Yakub’s last two weeks in the jail, sources said he didn’t share anything with other prison inmates but was confident of a favourable outcome, especially after his family told him that eminent lawyers, judges, politicians and journalists were supportive of his curative petition.          Activists protest against the hanging of the Mumbai blasts convict in the Capital on July 29It is claimed that Yakub had almost stopped eating in the past few days, and as a result was put on a drip. However, this could not be independently verified by Mail Today. Sources also said that five Maoists lodged at the Nagpur Central Jail were on fast in support of Yakub’s mercy petition. “He was well behaved. He didn’t discuss anything with anyone in the jail. But in the past few weeks, he started getting desperate to meet family members for updates regarding his curative petition. There were many such meetings in the past week and after each meeting, he looked more disturbed. But before the next meeting, he again looked charged,” sources in Nagpur jail said. Meanwhile, Nagpur Police have invoked Section 144 of CrPC (prohibiting the congregation of more than five persons) within 500 metres periphery of the jail, where Yakub will be hanged at 6am on Thursday.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       QUICK EDIT: Let's not politicise Memon's death    Hanging Yakub Memon will change our country      Share this article Share   Even the media paraphernalia will not be allowed into the restricted area till the hanging is over, Nagpur police sources said. Nobody is sure what steps the government will take to perform the last rites of Yakub, with the authorities also making arrangements on the Nagpur jail premises to give him a burial as per Islamic rites. The district authorities said they have not yet received any request from family members to accept Yakub’s last remains, but any such proposal would be considered, if and when it is received. “If there is any request from the family, then his body would be handed over to them…or the jail superintendent would decide on performing his last rites as per the laid down procedures,” a home ministry official said.           How the government had its way in the Supreme Court By Harish V Nair in New DelhiIt was the mastery of its top law officer Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi which won the day for the Narendra Modi government in the Supreme Court, which has finally cleared the decks for the hanging of Yakub Memon, the lone death row convict in the 1993 Mumbai blasts case. The government, determined to send Yakub to the gallows to send across a tough message that no act of terrorism will be tolerated, had almost lost it on Tuesday when Justice Kurian Joseph of the Supreme Court unexpectedly raised serious procedural lapses in the way the convict’s curative petition (the last legal remedy) was handled. The judge had inadvertently ended up giving a trump card for Yakub’s lawyer Raju Ramachandran, who almost immediately latched on to it.          Media and security personnel outside the Supreme Court on July 29With a split verdict, a new Bench had to be formed to hear the case and the possibility of deferment of the hanging fixed for the morning of July 30 loomed large. The danger was all the greater as Yakub’s lawyer, backed by Kurian’s observations, raised a host of procedural errors, enough to create a doubt in the mind of the new Bench which just had few hours to decide on a life-and-death issue. But articulate and aggressive Rohatgi convinced the new three-judge Bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra to conclude that there is no legal fallacy and fault in the death warrant issued against Yakub, the timing of it, or the composition of Supreme Court Bench which dismissed Yakub’s curative plea on July 22. Rohatgi had point by point demolished each of the arguments raised by Ramachandran, who was supported by senior civil rights lawyers TR Andhyarujina and Anand Grover, who were against death penalty for Yakub.“Yakub is a traitor who helped in killing 257 persons. Whatever sympathy he is now getting is because of the lapse of 22 years after the blast... now the memory is only reduced to images of burnt buildings shown on TV channels. Everyone has forgotten the innocent victims,” Rohatgi thundered before the court. Rohatgi made the comment when Andhyarujina referred to the fundamental rights of the convict and said his life was hanging by a thread and his “efforts to win life till the last breath should not be mocked”. Rohatgi shouted back: “What about the rights of the 257 persons (who died in blasts) and several hundreds who got injured?” Meanwhile, Yakub’s lawyer again moved the SC late on Wednesday after the President rejected his mercy plea.
