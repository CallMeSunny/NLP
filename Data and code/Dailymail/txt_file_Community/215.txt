Stock exchange newcomer Destiny Pharma soared 38.5 per cent in its first day of trading.The firm raised £15.3million at a placing price of 157p per share but jumped as high as 227p yesterday afternoon before finishing at 217.5p.One of the reasons it is so popular is because of its unique approach to treatment.The company is developing drugs to fight drug-resistant bacteria such as MRSA, which kill an estimated 700,000 people each year. But rather than focus on traditional antibiotics, it produces drugs which have cut the number of hospital-acquired infections by as much as 60 per cent.         Pioneers: One of the ways Destiny Pharma is fighting MRSA is by reducing the number of bugs in people’s noses before an operationOne way it does this is by reducing the number of bugs in people’s noses before an operation.The firm also has special status which means its drugs can be seen by the regulatory authorities quicker.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Google faces another record EU fine over claims of mobile...

STOCK WATCH - RANDALL AND QUILTER            Non-life legacy insurance firm Randall & Quilter boasted rising profits despite weaker results in the US.Profits had soared to £5.4million in the six months to the end of June, from £1.2million the year before, after solid results from its core UK business offset a slump in the US.Earnings were boosted by an increase in ‘legacy transactions’ which contributed £19.1million to its earnings – compared to its contribution of £2.7million the year before.

Acacia has been at loggerheads with the government since it imposed an export ban on gold concentrate in March. The disagreement escalated in May when the government claimed the miner’s gold output was 10 times greater than it claimed – a level that Acacia said would make it the ‘third-biggest gold miner in the world’.Tensions heightened again when the Tanzanian authorities slapped it with a £147billion bill in July, though Acacia said it had declared all materials produced and paid royalties and taxes in full. Acacia, which is dependent on its three mines in Tanzania, had stockpiled gold concentrate hoping for a quick end to the dispute.But the firm said that despite reducing its operating costs to protect jobs, the Bulyanhulu mine was no longer sustainable.Investors were put out by the news and shares, which plunged more than 13 per cent when markets first opened yesterday, finished down 2.4 per cent, or 4.9p, to 202.2p.The FTSE 100 finished down 0.36 per cent, or 27.03 points, to 7411.47, while the FTSE 250 finished down 0.45 per cent, or 88.27 points, to 19,697.91. Investors in Frontier Developments and Arix Bioscience reacted positively to announcements of new senior hires.Shares in video game maker Frontier jumped 3.3 per cent, or 35p, to 1082.5p, when it revealed it had appointed Stewart Stanbury, a former brand and strategy executive at Google, to serve as its director of marketing.And Arix Bioscience’s Artois Pharma soared 3.2 per cent, or 6p, to 193.5p, after it poached former AstraZeneca boss Dr Graeme Smith as it chief scientific officer.Gas firm Sound Energy soared after it revealed it had received a proposal for financing one of its gas pipelines in Morocco.It said it had received an indicative non-binding proposal from Advisory & Finance Group Investment Bank of around £46million to £77million. It comes after the Oil & Gas Investment Fund indicated an interest in funding in July last year.
