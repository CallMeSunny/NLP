 WASHINGTON, May 13 () - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping are working to give Chinese telecom company ZTE Corp "a way to get back into business, fast." "President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!" Trump wrote on Twitter. The Chinese technology company earlier this month suspended its main operations after the U.S. Commerce Department banned American supplies to its business. As one of the worldÂ´s largest telecom equipment makers, ZTE relied on U.S. companies such as Qualcomm Inc and Intel Corp for components. (Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)
