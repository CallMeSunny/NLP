 'I just tried to answer the emails and try to get out in front and say, "I had nothing to do with this."'Castaldo says he is 'not a political guy' and found the video 'overproduced... too long... redundant... [and] repetitious', though admits it was 'edited well'.A statement on Destiny Pictures' website also makes it clear that the firm 'Had No Involvement In President Trump NK Summit Video.' CNN reports that the video was in fact created by the White House National Security Council.         The video, entitled A Story Of Opportunity, was designed to show Kim what North Korea could be like if he abandons his nukes and adopts the free market economy         Trump said he was encouraging Kim to think of North Korea 'from a real estate perspective' by showing him footage of beach resorts he could develop Two White House officials refused to comment on who created the video when asked by Dailymail.com.Castaldo says he has no idea why the video would feature his company's name, but theorizes that it was chosen at random for its hopeful connotations Trump said the video was 'a version of what could happen and take place' in North Korea if Kim pursues a path of peace and disarmament.'They have great beaches! You see that whenever they're exploding the cannons into the ocean, right?' Trump said after he played the four minute video for the press.'So I said, "Boy, look at that beach. Wouldn't that make a great condo behind–," and I explained it,' the real estate billionaire recalled.         The heavily produced video, made with both Korean and English voiceovers, portrays Kim Jong-un as a man with a choice of moving his country forward or backward         Images in the video included many of smiling North Koreans – but none of the country's gulags and forced labor camps'I said, "Instead of doing that you could have the best hotels in the world right there." Think of it from a real estate perspective.'A voiceover in the video described Tuesday's summit as 'a special moment in time when a man is presented with one chance that may never be repeated. What will he choose? To show vision and leadership? Or not?''Will this leader choose to advance his country and be part of a new world? Be the hero of his people?' the narrator says later, over a climactic string orchestra. 'Will he shake the hand of peace and enjoy prosperity like he has never seen? A great life, or isolation? Which path will be chosen?'
