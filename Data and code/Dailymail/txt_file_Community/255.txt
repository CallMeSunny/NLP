India and China on Tuesday looked to move beyond the 72-day border stand-off that strained relations and ensure such incidents do not recur, as their two leaders met in Xiamen. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks that officials described as 'forward looking' and that lasted for more than an hour - beyond the scheduled 30 minutes - following the end of the BRICS Summit. This was their first meeting since the August 28 disengagement at Doklam, and their ninth meeting. Both leaders discussed a wide range of bilateral issues, including managing border disputes and strengthening mechanisms to ensure 'an upward trajectory' in the relationship, officials said.          A meeting between the two heads of state was said to be positive and overrun by half an hour as the BRICS summit came to a close         (L-R) Brazil's President Michel Temer, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, South Africa's President Jacob Zuma and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pose during the BRICS Summit at Xiamen International Conference and Exhibition CentreAn important consensus was that peace and tranquility in border areas was 'a prerequisite' for developing ties, Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar said. 'Especially with regard to defence and security personnel, they must maintain strong contact and cooperation, and ensure that the sort of situations, which happened recently do not occur,' Jaishankar said. He said both leaders laid out 'a very positive view of where our relationship could go' and that there was 'detailed discussions of mechanisms that could help both countries really go forward'.          Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan greet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi before the welcoming banquet for the BRICS Summit, in Xiamen, China         Modi was welcomed at Xiamen airport by Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou and the Chinese envoy to India Luo ZhaohuiThis included inter-governmental mechanisms, such as the joint economic group, as well as defence and security dialogues and also fora such as BRICS and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank - that both sides see as valuable platforms to widen engagement.Much of the focus of the bilateral was also on widening economic cooperation particularly under the BRICS framework. Terrorism was not discussed at the bilateral, although it figured in discussions in the lead up to the BRICS Summit, which on Monday issued a declaration that strongly endorsed India's concerns and named several Pakistan-based groups. Xi conveyed to the Prime Minister that both sides should 'shelve differences' on border disputes, Chinese officials said.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       BRICS group name Pakistan-based terrorists in declaration...
