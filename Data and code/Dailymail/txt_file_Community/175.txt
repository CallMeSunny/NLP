Farah says his Olympic destiny will come down to final seconds in London By Sportsmail Reporter   Updated: 17:51 BST, 27 January 2012                     View  comments   After years of sacrifice and thousands of miles of training, Mo Farah believes his Olympic dream will be decided by a fraction of a second in London.And the world champion is banking on the support of 80,000 home fans to get him across the line first as he begins his season in Glasgow, just days after returning from altitude training in Kenya.Farah, who won gold over 5,000metres and silver in the 10,000m in Daegu last year, will compete over 1,500m in the Aviva International Match at Kelvin Hall as part of his plan to produce a devastating sprint finish in London.      Medal hopes: Mo Farah (right) with Hannah England and former British athlete Ian Stewart is Glasgow   The difference between gold and silver in both of Farah's races in Korea was tiny - 0.26 seconds in the 10,000m and 0.28secs in the 5,000m - and the 28-year-old believes it will be the same on home soil this summer.     All smiles: Farah is pleased with all the preparation he has put in during his warm weather training in Kenya'I believe it's going to come down to a one-lap race in London unless someone goes really early,' Farah said. 'Zersenay Tadese tried to go at the worlds but couldn't break the field.'It's definitely going to come down to the last lap and nought-point-something (of a second).'I've been working a little bit to try and shorten my stride. When you are sprinting you want to move more upright and take shorter strides, but I have a long loping stride. It's going to be a 51, 52-second last lap for sure to win gold.'I did a relay split years ago for my club and it was 49 seconds, but that wasn't at the end of a 10,000m! It was a 4x400 relay.' Farah's last competitive 1,500m was in Monaco in 2009 when he finished a lowly 10th, but much has changed since then.Last year's move to Portland, Oregon to be coached by Alberto Salazar paid handsome dividends, and Farah has gone from an also-ran at the very highest level to arguably Britain's best hope for gold on the track.But the Somalia-born athlete is determined to use the pressure and expectation to his advantage.He added: 'You try and use that in a positive way, when you hear the crowd it gives you a lift and I hope that if I'm coming down a sprint finish with 50m to go the crowd is going to make that difference.'      Destiny calling: Farah is one of the favourites for Olympic gold in London While Farah was expected to win a medal in Daegu, Hannah England's silver in the 1,500m came as something of a surprise - not least to the woman herself.But the 24-year-old believes that success has finally given her the self-belief to compete more consistently at the highest level as she looks to follow in the footsteps of her mentor, Kelly Holmes, by winning Olympic gold.'It's just mentally knowing I am good enough to run with the other girls," said England, who will also compete over 1,500m in Glasgow. 'I've always done it on the odd day, had the odd spark of world class, but it's been about making that more consistent and topping it off with a medal last year.'I was putting other people and their achievements on a pedestal. Last year I knocked three seconds off my personal best and finished a lot higher in a big race than I ever have, and I thought that was what I'd achieve in another four or five years. I didn't realise I was already at that stage.'I held the opposition in a bit of awe. You can be guilty of looking at PBs (personal bests) and thinking 'Oh blimey that's so fast', and now I've done that you think it's not that special and if I can do that it makes it normal.'
