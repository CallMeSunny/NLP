 By Venus Wu HONG KONG, June 30 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping said there have been "new issues" and "new challenges" in Hong Kong's implementation of the "one country, two systems" principle that guarantees the city a high degree of autonomy. He added these issues should be handled correctly and analyzed rationally, and that he remained confident in the city. Xi made the comments carried by local television while meeting about 200 delegates from all sectors of Hong Kong society during his three-day visit to celebrate the former British colony's 20 years under Chinese rule.
