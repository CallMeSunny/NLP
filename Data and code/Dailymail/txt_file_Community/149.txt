Destiny and deja vu for Myanmar's Suu Kyi on campaign trail By Afp   Published: 06:11 BST, 6 November 2015  |  Updated: 06:12 BST, 6 November 2015                e-mail        9 shares    The last time Myanmar held a nationwide election, Aung San Suu Kyi languished under house arrest while her party's landslide win was simply ignored by the country's brutal military rulers.Twenty-five years later, the democracy champion is free to hit the road, criss-crossing the nation and drawing large, jubilant crowds in an attempt to clinch what observers are hoping will be Myanmar's fairest vote in decades.For Suu Kyi, the November 8 polls are a watershed moment in a life entwined with the turbulent political struggles of her homeland, shaped by decades of brutal junta rule that only began to ease in 2011.

They imagine that the democratic destiny halted in the 1990s is now in reach."Suu Kyi was born on June 19, 1945 in Japanese-occupied Rangoon -- now called Yangon -- during the closing stages of World War II.Her father Aung San fought for and against both the British and the Japanese colonisers as he jostled to give his country the best shot at independence.- Thrust into limelight -That goal was achieved in 1948 but Aung San was assassinated alongside most of his cabinet just months before.Suu Kyi spent most of her early years outside of Myanmar, first in India after her mother was posted as ambassador there and later at Oxford University where she met her British husband.After General Ne Win seized full power in 1962 he forced his own brand of socialism on Myanmar, turning it from Asia's rice bowl into one of the world's poorest and most isolated countries.Suu Kyi's elevation into a democracy champion happened almost by accident after she returned in 1988 to nurse her sick mother.Soon afterwards protests erupted against the military, but were crushed in a crackdown that left at least 3,000 people dead.The bloodshed was the catalyst for Suu Kyi. A charismatic orator, she found herself in a leading role in the burgeoning pro-democracy movement, delivering speeches to crowds of hundreds of thousands.During her house arrest years the junta offered to end her imprisonment at any time if she left the country for good but Suu Kyi refused.That decision meant not seeing her husband before his death from cancer in 1999, and missing her two sons growing up.The military eventually granted her freedom in 2010, just days after flawed elections.Two years later she entered parliament after the NLD swept a series of by-elections.But even if her party wins this general election, she cannot become president thanks to a junta-era constitution that forbids anyone with foreign born offspring from taking the top spot.She towers over the NLD and some observers question whether her star power has eclipsed the efforts of younger party members to emerge.Suu Kyi has vowed to amend the charter. On Thursday she went further, declaring that she will occupy a position "above the president" if the NLD win.In so doing she issued a challenge to the army as well as a reminder to her supporters that she occupies centre stage in Myanmar's political drama.But first she has to win.
