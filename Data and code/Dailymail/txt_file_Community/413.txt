Speaking openly about his mother is important, says Prince William, because it ‘reminds people of the person she was’. But, significantly, in doing so, he has been equally revealing about himself.For this is not just a poignant homage to an adored mother. It also offers a fresh portrait of a more purposeful Prince at a pivotal moment in his life.In the next few days William will formally complete his transition from part-time royalty to frontline member of the Firm. Before the end of the month he will carry out his last mission as a pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance and hang up his flying suit. From September he will devote all his time to public duties in support of the Queen.         The Princess Of Wales, William and Harry at the VJ Day 50th Anniversary Celebrations In London in 1995. In the next few days William will formally complete his transition from part-time royalty to frontline member of the Firm         Princess Diana and William watching Prince Charles at Smith's Lawn playing polo in 1987 We're both in the photo          Diana cuddling William while she was pregnant with HarryDressed in a casual pink jumper and beaming as she cuddles William, this candid photo of Diana has been released for the first time.And what made the picture even more special to the princes is that she was pregnant with Harry at the time.In the ITV documentary, the brothers flick through her photo albums. When they come across this one, William says: ‘Believe it or not, you and I are both in this photograph. You’re in the tummy.’Harry replies: ‘Oh, nice. You look excited you’ve got a brother or sister coming.’ William says he thought the picture was ‘sweet’, and Harry adds: ‘She seems happy there as well.’  We are going to see more of the Cambridges undertaking trips like last week’s tour of Poland and Germany. As British ministers and diplomats battle to reposition the UK on the post-Brexit world stage, it is the Royal Family who will be expected to apply soothing balm to all the bilateral cuts and bruises.All of which, inevitably, will invite fresh scrutiny of the Duke’s appetite for the role which lies ahead, particularly in light of Prince Harry’s recent remark: ‘Is there any one of the Royal Family who wants to be king or queen? I don’t think so.’In tonight’s film, though, his older brother comes across as a mature, stoical, reflective figure who seems comfortable focusing on the next stage of his life. Not long after his wedding in 2011 I asked William what he thought about his royal destiny. ‘As I am flying along in my helicopter,’ he replied, ‘I try desperately hard not to think about it. That can wait until I’m older.’Six years on, it would seem he has thought about it a lot and it is clear that his mother has shaped his attitude to the job.‘She gave us the right tools and has prepared us well for life,’ he points out. ‘She understood that there was a real life outside [the] Palace walls, and she wanted us to see it from a very young age. We understood some of the real problems in life that can pass you by very easily.’William clearly acknowledges that those in positions of great privilege have a moral obligation to explore outside their comfort zones. Hence, the sight of him visiting a shelter for the homeless. As he points out, it all stems from visiting the homeless with his mother at the age of 12.                 Prince William and Princess Diana Skiing Holiday in Lech, Austria, in 1991         Princess Diana taking Prince William and Harry to Wetherby school London in 1989        PAPARAZZI SPAT ON HER TO MAKE HER CRYDiana's treatment by paparazzi has left her sons wary of media intrusion.Prince William said: ‘If you are the Princess of Wales and you’re a mother, I don’t believe being chased by 30 guys on motorbikes who block your path, who spit at you to get a reaction from you, and make a woman cry in public to get the photographs, I don’t believe that is appropriate.’William said people would be ‘utterly appalled’ if they knew the extent of the way his mother was treated. An inquest in 2008 found the ‘pack’ of French freelance photographers on motorbikes was a contributory factor in the crash that killed her.What we sense in this film, however, is a new confidence in front of the camera. Here is someone with an innate wariness of the media – ‘one lesson I’ve learnt is you never let them in too far because it’s very difficult to get them back out again’; a man for whom speech-making is clearly a duty rather than a pleasure.Yet, when discussing subjects which would leave many eloquent public figures floundering for words, William shows a natural empathy. ‘My heart goes out to all the people who have lost their loved ones,’ he says. ‘You know – it does connect you. It’s a very sad “club” you don’t want to be a member of. 'But you do all have a shared sort of pain that you can immediately understand and see in anyone when you meet them.’        Prince William, Prince Harry and Prince Charles watch as Diana's coffin is driven away from Westminster Abbey PARENTS' SPLIT LEFT DIANA A 'BUNDLE OF INSECURITIES'          Her parents separated when she was a child and fought a bitter divorce which left the young Diana (pictured in Italy in 1997), with emotional scarsEarl Spencer said his sister Diana was ‘a bundle of insecurities and unhappiness’ after her own parents’ divorce.Her parents separated when she was a child and fought a bitter divorce which left the young Diana with emotional scars.Her younger brother said the turbulent years meant she empathised with others who were suffering. Earl Spencer told the documentary: ‘My mother left home when I was two or three and so Diana was the most significant warm female presence in my life.‘Because of her own sensitivities and vulnerabilities, she felt able to connect with people who were going through a very tough time. And [she could] sort of give them hope.’The Princes may have stayed quiet for many years about their own deep loss but no more. Tonight’s film shows they are determined to shape the way the world remembers their mother rather than leaving it to others.That was underlined by William’s decision to introduce the film personally at a special preview screening for royal correspondents.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       'The things I'd have said to her... if I knew it was the...

 Subtext: this is no ordinary documentary – this is our documentary.Of two things we can be very clear. However much critics of the Royal Family accuse them of ‘airbrushing’ Diana from history, there is no chance of that.And as William embarks on the next phase of royal life, he clearly feels he now has the ‘tools’ for the job.        HARRY AND WILLIAM ON THEIR MOTHER - IN THEIR OWN WORDS          The family are pictured here on holiday in France. William said, 'I constantly talk about Granny Diana. We’ve got photos up round the house of her'Harry on the divorce The two of us were bouncing between the two of them. It was an interesting way of growing up. Harry on coping with grief The first time I cried was at the funeral on the island. Since then, maybe once. A lot of grief still needs to be let out. Wills on remembering herI constantly talk about Granny Diana. We’ve got photos up round the house of her.Wills on their last phone call We were in a rush to say goodbye. If I’d known what would happen I wouldn’t have been so blasé. That call sticks in my mind quite heavily. ...and Harry on the call I have to deal with that for the rest of my life, not knowing it was the last time I’d speak to my mum. Harry on national mourning It was very strange. I thought, how can so many people be showing more emotion than I feel? Wills on losing a parent Like an earthquake’s run through your life.
