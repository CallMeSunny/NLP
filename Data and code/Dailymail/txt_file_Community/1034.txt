 One is a 'soft rescue' where agents pose as clients and dine out with them to gain their trust before meeting at a safe house and giving them the choice of staying with Destiny Rescue or going back to their employer.The other is a full-scale operation that aims to shut down a whole brothel, which was the chosen method to extract Nung last month in Bangkok.








         Here one of an undercover agent of not-for-profit organisation Destiny Rescue is seen talking to a young girl named Nung         Justin, who posed a regular customer, helped save Nung from years of abuse at a Bangkok brothelAn undercover agent, a New Zealand man known only as Justin, was planted inside the girl's workplace as a regular customer. 'You see her getting taken multiple times every single night by guys taking her to the room, abusing and waiting in the back again for the next guy,' Justin observed.When it was time to strike, Justin expressed to Nung's mamasan he wanted to buy her to have sex, with the conversation being caught on a hidden camera.The pair came to an agreement and Nung was sold to Justin for AU$120.He paid for the girl with marked money so the police could track the exchange and she was taken to a hotel room.This is where the police came in and checked her identification before more than 20 officers stormed the brothel.During the raid, they located the marked money and find a further 10 under-age girls work at the brothel, which has since been shut down.         This woman is the manager and owner of the brothel Nung was working in. She and Justin negotiated to buy Nung for sex for AU$120. She was caught on camera selling the teenager         Justin took Nung back to a hotel room where police checked her identification before storming the brothel and shutting it downThe mamasan, who also claimed she owned the venue, faces human trafficking charges that attract a lengthy jail sentence. But Mr Kirwin, who started Destiny Rescue in 2001 after an eye-opening trip to Thailand with his wife and three daughters, said there were tens of thousands more girls to be saved.He said a 'despicable' amount of Australians headed to Thailand for sex and a majority of them ignore the reality that these girls were sold off like cattle, a lot of the time by their parents.'It should be a national outcry, I mean we should be ashamed,' Mr Kirwan told the Channel Seven news program.'It's definitely changed my perception of Aussie men and I want it changed back. I want us to be the good guys I want us to be the guys that said... we're going to fix the problem we're not going to come over and feed the problem.'         Tony Kirwan started Destiny Rescue back in 2001 after an eye-opening trip to Thailand with his wife and daughtersMr Kirwan said he wanted to give the girls a second chance at life.'Hopefully [it] will be the switching point for her [Nung] to go from a life of slavery and abuse and horrible things happening to her, to you know, freedom and pursuing some real dreams that she's had her whole life,' he said.'I love people going to jail for doing the wrong thing. This is a great night... One brothel at a time, one kid at a time, one arrest at a time.'Destiny Rescue helps girls in eight different countries - including Cambodia, Laos, India and the Philippines - and they run programs to equip the rescued children with more skills to help them transition to new jobs in different industries, such as hairdressing and hospitality.For more information about the organisation or to donate, visit www.destinyrescue.org.
