Family planning and contraception are not for Muslim families.So says President Erdogan of Turkey in his latest pronouncement, urging Muslim women to hurry up and have more children.It appears they are listening. If you look at the Turkish population over the last 50 years, it is a straight line graph rising exponentially from under 30million in 1960 to nearly 80million by 2010.         Target: Family planning and contraception are not for Muslim families, says President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey in his latest pronouncement, urging Muslim women to hurry up and have more childrenErdogan has even set women a target of four children: ‘One child is loneliness, two is rivalry, three is balance and four is abundance.’Gordon Ramsay must be his pin-up.Men are encouraged to mate with multiple wives and Turkish women are reminded their first role is popping out eggs like a battery hen serviced by a shared cock. All in an attempt to send the Muslim population soaring.My first priority might be my children. But in order to make them my problem, not someone else's, my first role is that of provider.

Share this article Share 1.7k shares   I have a simple principle on childbirth.I chose to have my children. Other taxpayers didn’t. They should not be penalised for my decisions. I pay for their home, health and schooling.When it comes to Turkey, you might be tempted to tell me to keep my big nose out. Their family-planning policies are not my business.But you see, they are about to become my business and yours. Turkey is incoming.As part of the deal for stopping migrants crossing from Turkey into Greece, we have all but promised visa-free travel inside the Schengen Zone to the entire Turkish population.         Migrants arrive on a Greek coastguard patrol boat into the port of Mytilene in Lesbos, following a rescue operation in a part of the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece in FebruaryThis deal, or act of blackmail as I prefer to call it, will open up the EU to 80 million Turks.And as we all know, tracking or repatriating individuals that have already arrived in Europe is not of concern or consequence.We have also committed £6billion of European funding to Turkey over the next five-year period. They are about to become my business and yours. Turkey is incoming Meanwhile, in a cunning sleight of hand, Turkey simply encourages Syrian and other migrants to turn left instead of right and make the crossing via Libya.Given 700 people died in the Med this week alone, the flow of people has not stopped. Using their Samsung Migrant Satnav, people are simply selecting a new, more dangerous route.When Turkey achieves visa-free travel inside the EU, its irresponsible attitude to family planning becomes our problem pretty fast. Our maternity units will bear the brunt of catching these babies.And undoubtedly, as the push towards ever-closer union continues, we will find ourselves finding homes and schools for this exploding population as well.Looking around Birmingham and Leicester, the percentage of Muslims in the under-five age group is almost twice as high as in the general population. Almost a tenth of babies in England and Wales are Muslim. When you consider only 4.5 per cent of the UK is Muslim, the changing face of Britain is made starker.       Given 700 people died in the Med this week alone, the flow of people has not stopped. Migrants are pictured being rescued at sea in this photograph released yesterday by the Italian Navy Marina Militare       If you are at an age where you are no longer fighting for school places for your child, let me open your eyes to exactly where we are at.Our primary schools are full. Bursting with classes of almost 40 kids.Parents often cannot get a place in any of their preferred schools. Our primary schools are full. Bursting with classes of almost 40 kids. Parents often cannot get a place in any of their preferred schools  Official figures point to a shortfall of 10,000 places in four years, and that’s based on our current population growth. If it rockets exponentially, hundreds of thousands of children could be without formal education.We are stealing from budgets meant for repairs to pay to extend cramped spaces to squeeze in more people.I have stood in a full primary classroom and wanted to weep. You’d have to be desperate to learn to stand even a chance. High achievers become baby-sitters for the badly behaved.I am horribly glad my kids are just ahead of this fortunate to be taught in class sizes of ten to 12.I have no doubt private schools will be clawed back into the state school system to create more space, dismantling everything parents and dedicated heads worked hard to build.You might try to argue we are not in the Schengen Zone, so we are protected. But as 18 illegal Albanians arrived in an inflatable off the Kent coast on Sunday, I am not reassured.         The boat believed to have been carrying 18 Albanian migrants who needed rescuing off the Kent coastWe know European migrants get into the UK by fair means or foul, in inflatable boats or lorries.It isn’t just the young men with their mobile phones to whom you should turn your attention. It’s the women with small children and another on the way. Operation Sophia was named after a baby born to a Somali woman in August on board a rescue ship, for goodness sake.Migrants are willing to send small, unaccompanied children ahead of them, to try to secure a place for their family in Europe. Like a worm on a fishing line, thrown out hopefully into murky waters, chancing one life to catch opportunity for the others. Women are the new people traffickers. Smugglers in an illicit trade of human cargo of a more personal kind, dramatically changing the demographics of the West We've seen migrants dangle their babies over the side of their rickety boat off the coast of Italy, threatening to drop them if the Italians turned their boat back to Libya.Women are the new people traffickers. Smugglers in an illicit trade of human cargo of a more personal kind, dramatically changing the demographics of the West.President Erdogan is not hiding his intentions: ‘I will say it clearly, we need to increase the number of our descendants.’To what end? Until babies are just disposable items? Spares lives to be discarded along the way?As another picture emerges of a baby drowned in the Med, what are we supposed to do? Shed more tears? Listen to the lectures of Aylin Kurdi’s father telling us we aren’t doing enough to help? A man, lest we forget, who let his wife and son drown in the Med but somehow managed to save his own skin.No. No. No.Stop the boats. Stop the flow of migrants into our country. And stop making British nationals compete for school and doctor’s places with a population who, according to President Erdogan, have no understanding or acceptance of birth control and family planning.My primary role as a women is as a provider for my children. I do not wish to extend that courtesy to children born to colonise the country I love.
