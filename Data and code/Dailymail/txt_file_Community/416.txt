 Outside of London, Slough had the highest percentage at 62.0 per cent, followed by Luton  with 56.4 per cent. By contrast just 11 per cent of live births in the North East were to women born outside of Britain.  ONS spokeswoman Elizabeth McLaren said: 'The rising percentage of births to women born outside the UK is largely due to foreign born women making up an increasing share of the female population of childbearing age in England and Wales. 'Part of the reason for this is that migrants are more likely to be working-age adults rather than children or older people. 'Alongside their increasing share of the population, higher fertility among women born outside the UK has also had an impact.'         The ONS figures showed a sharp regional variation in the proportion of babies with mothers who were born overseas Meanwhile, separate figures have shown that Poland is the most common overseas country of birth for people living in the UK for the first time.There were an estimated 831,000 Polish-born residents in 2015 - a jump of almost three quarters of a million compared to the number in 2004 when the country joined the EU.It meant Poland overtook India, which had 795,000 people last year, as the most common non-UK nation of birth.Polish was also the most common non-British nationality, with an estimated 916,000 residents. Figures are compiled both by both country of birth and nationality, which can be subject to change.Overall, one in eight (13.3 per cent) of the people living in the UK were born abroad last year - compared to one in 11 in 2004.There was a 'statistically significant increase' in the non-UK born population of the UK between 2014 and 2015, rising from 8.3 million to 8.6 million, the Office for National Statistics said.  Net migration is still more than TRIPLE government target at 327,000Theresa May is under intense pressure to find ways of curbing immigration after it emerged numbers are still running at more than triple the government's target.Net migration in the year to March was 327,000, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - the third highest level on record.Some 180,000 of the total came from the EU. The numbers arriving from Romania and Bulgaria - the newest EU states - hit a new high of 69,000.Around 127,000 of the incomers had no set job to go to - including 77,000 from the EU.The figures - which only cover longer-term migrants - are the first since the historic Brexit vote in the EU referendum. They will renew demands for the government to press ahead with plans to cut ties with Brussels.           The latest net annual migration figures show numbers were 327,000 in the year to MarchThe previous set of information published in May showed net migration running slightly higher at 334,000 in the year to December, with the EU making up some 184,000 of the total.The revelation dominated much of the referendum campaign, with David Cameron struggling to explain how levels could be brought down within the Brussels club - which insists on free movement of labour. The ONS figures showed that immigration was 633,000 over the period, while emigration was 306,000.Immigration from Romania and Bulgaria, which became full EU members in 2013, hit 69,000.For the first time levels from those two countries have overtaken migration from the eight states that joined in 2004 - including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic - which was running at 68,000.A net total of 43,000 Britons left the country over the 12 months.
