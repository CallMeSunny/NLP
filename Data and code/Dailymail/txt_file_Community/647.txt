 WASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - China's leader Xi Jinping told U.S. President Donald Trump in a letter that he hopes both sides will be able to meet each other halfway to reach a trade agreement before a March 1 deadline, Trump said on Thursday. Trump read from the letter to reporters during a White House meeting with China's Vice Premier Liu He, who is in Washington trying to reach a deal that would ease trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.
