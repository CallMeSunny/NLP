Xi's tipple sends UK ale exports soaring By Afp   Published: 14:08 BST, 2 December 2015  |  Updated: 14:08 BST, 2 December 2015                e-mail         British brewer Greene King on Wednesday said exports of its India pale ale (IPA) to China had increased sixteen-fold after President Xi Jinping was photographed enjoying a pint during his recent state visit.The brewer has shipped 50,000 cases of the hoppy beer to China after Xi's visit to The Plough pub in Buckinghamshire, southern England, with Prime Minister David Cameron during October's trip."If the British prime minister chooses to drink IPA that's normal, but if the president of China chooses to drink a British beer it attracts lots of interest," Greene King chief executive Rooney Anand said.
