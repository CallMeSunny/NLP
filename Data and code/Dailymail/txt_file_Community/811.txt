Indian state TV sacks anchor over China blunder By Associated Press   Published: 10:45 BST, 19 September 2014  |  Updated: 10:45 BST, 19 September 2014                e-mail         NEW DELHI (AP) — A news anchor for India's state TV channel has been fired after she referred to Chinese President Xi Jinping as "Eleven" Jingping — apparently mistaking his name for a Roman numeral, a top official at the station said Friday.Xi left for China on Friday after a three-day visit to India, where he signed more than a dozen agreements to push trade and investment between the two Asian giants.The anchor for the Doordarshan news channel made the gaffe on Wednesday night while she read a late night news bulletin. She was dismissed after the blunder was discovered, the TV station official said.The anchor was a "casual" employee, working temporarily, and not a regular staffer, he said.He asked that his name not be used because he did not want to comment publicly on the matter.
