A controversial assisted dying activist dubbed 'Dr Death' will 'gas' people at the Edinburgh Fringe festival using his own euthanasia machine.Dr Philip Nitschke will ask his audience - some of whom may be terminally ill - to try his 'Destiny' machine to show them 'a peaceful and reliable means of death'.His 'easy to use' apparatus is a new version of the Deliverance machine he used to end the lives of four people in the 1990s.Anti-assisted dying campaigners today criticised the decision to allow him to showcase his killing equipment in Britain.          Dr Death: Dr Philip Nitschke will star in a show on the Edinburgh Fringe and will allow the audience to try his 'Destiny' machine (pictured) to show them 'a peaceful and reliable means of death'Last month Metropolitan Police questioned Dr Nitschke under caution amid concerns about the show's content.He was eventually cleared to perform at the Fringe throughout August, with officers concluding his show would not encourage suicide, which is a crime in Britain. However, with just two weeks to go until his show opens, the medic today appointed Scottish lawyers to ensure it does not breach the Scots Law on advising, counselling or assisting others to commit suicide.

 He confirmed: 'My lawyers provided me with Scottish lawyers this morning and I will ask their specific advice on that issue.'Giving information about these sorts of drugs can be construed as being in breach of the law which prohibits advising, counselling or assisting.'We will be asking people attending the show to sign disclaimers for that very reason.' Despite this, anti-euthanasia group Care Not Killing has urged Police Scotland and the Crown Office to take a close look at the show.         Comedy?  In the show Nitschke was due to appear alongside British terminally ill comedian Mel Moon (pictured together), but she has since pulled outDr Nitschke added: 'The Metropolitan Police started by saying they want to have a chat about a show I was running, but that ended up being a cautioned interview.'The Director of Public Prosecutions must have been satisfied because they contacted my lawyers saying they had no reason at this stage to take this any further, so we are feeling a bit more comfortable.'However, Dr Nitschke has not spoken to Police Scotland or the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service about his show, which opens on August 6.Dr Nitschke will explain how his Destiny machine kills users by helping them inhale a lethal cocktail of gases.Fringe-goers who attend his 'Dicing with Dr Death' show will be allowed to inhale a non-lethal gas through the apparatus' gas mask or nasal probe.He designed it after consulting with the lawyer of right-to-die and locked in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson, who died two years ago.Explaining what will happen he told The Independent: 'The new Destiny euthanasia machine will provide people with a peaceful and reliable means of death.'Suicide is not a crime in the UK, and assistance is not required to use Destiny, which is perfectly legal.'In Edinburgh I will ask for volunteers and point out that nitrogen only will be used, but as part of the machine display everyone will see the volunteer’s cardiac trace projected - the gas can only be switched on if there is a cardiac trace, and switched off as soon as the trace flat-lines'.Destiny asks the user three questions to check they are certain they want to die.Gas from an attached cylinder is only administered when the machine picks up a heartbeat from a probe and is switched off when the trace disappears.Dr Nitschke, originally from Darwin, successfully campaigned to have a legal euthanasia law passed in Australia's Northern Territory in the 1990s and helped four terminally ill people end their lives.The law was overturned after nine months in March 1997 by the Australian Parliament.His medical licence was suspended but the ruling was overturned on appeal, although the Australian authorities are still refusing to reinstate him.         Apparatus: Destiny asks the user three questions before it administers a lethal dose of gas and switches off once the person connected diesIn the past he invented a device called the 'exit bag' - a large bag placed over the head and filled with a gas - and 'Peaceful Pills', a lethal product which suppresses the nervous system and is used in countries where euthanasia is legalised. Dr Nitschke admits the audience is likely to be largely 'well people' who 'want to know what their choices are' to end their lives.But speaking to ABC in Australia he said that the Fringe show will be funny.He said: 'When people start to listen to the accounts of what actually happens when they try desperately to get choices at the end of life, you can't help but laugh'.The decision to allow him to perform in Edinburgh has been hugely controversial Agnes Fletcher, Director of Living and Dying Well said: 'Committing suicide is rightly not a criminal offence in this country – but encouraging or assisting someone to kill themselves is.              Legal battle: Paul Lamb, left, and Jane Nicklinson, whose 58-year-old husband Tony, right, died more than two years ago, brought the case at the court in Strasbourg - but it failed today“We do all that we can to prevent people from committing suicide - whatever the cause of their suicidal feelings and whether or not we can relieve all their issues. This clear principle protects all of us, at our most vulnerable, from abuse, coercion or feeling a duty to die for the financial or emotional benefit of others.'Freedom of expression and debate is important - but let’s hope ‘Dr Death’s’ demonstration of how his Destiny euthanasia machine gasses people to death is destined to get the rotten tomatoes it deserves'.Justifying its inclusion a Fringe spokesman said: ‘The Edinburgh Festival Fringe is an open access festival, which means nobody selects the shows that take part. The performers come from all over the world to present their shows at Edinburgh Fringe because they themselves have chosen to take part in this unique and extraordinary event.’ Last week a right-to-die case brought by a paralysed former builder and locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson's widow was rejected by the European Court of Human Rights.Paul Lamb and Jane Nicklinson, whose 58-year-old husband died more than two years ago, brought the case to the court in Strasbourg.It was the culmination of their campaign that disabled people should have the right to choose to be helped to die with dignity.The court was asked to decide whether a prohibition on assisted suicide - outlined in the 1961 Suicide Act - was compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. But in a written judgment, the court said: 'In its decision in the case of Nicklinson and Lamb v. the United Kingdom the European Court of Human Rights has unanimously declared the applications inadmissible. The decision is final.'
