You got this! Believe in yourself and put in the work,' she added.In 2016 she signed up for a bikini competition that was three weeks away so had to up her game significantly as competitors usually train for 12-16 weeks and found that by swapping out carbs for protein, she was able to reduce her body fat significantly. However, after her bikini competition, she decided she wanted to grow her butt even more so started to incorporate more food into her diet by not restricting carbs or calorie counting. Speaking to Cosmopolitan, she detailed that she now eats four meals per day made up of a protein shake or a fruit and yogurt smoothie for breakfast plus three servings of chicken, vegetables and a source of complex carbohydrate like sweet potato or brown rice (covered in hot sauce) throughout the day. She also has an additional protein shake after her workout if she's craving something sweet.                 Gym bunny: Destiny works her legs and glutes four times per week and does specific exercises to grow her booty              Alternative method: As she can't do squats because of an old gymnastics injury, she grew her butt doing split squats and lunges instead         Heavy duty: She uses heavy barbells to help her target her glutes 'I have no problem with eating the same thing every day,' she said.   At weekends, Destiny allows herself one to two cheat meals while eating out.However, she also admitted that her butt isn't just down to diet alone and she focused on exercises that target that specific area four days a week. On the other days she focuses on other parts of her body and twice a week, she does high-intensity interval training (HIIT) sessions for cardio.However, the one exercise she never does is squats because of an old gymnastics injury. Instead Destiny focuses on other butt building maneuvers including using a resistance band to perform a series of exercises that work her glutes, followed by barbell hip thrusts, split squats, lunge kickbacks and deadlifts.   And although she's committed to her routine and frequently posts revealing pictures of her pert posterior online, insists she isn't motivated by her looks. 'I go to the gym mainly because it's my happy place. It's a lifestyle and commitment to myself,' she said.          How to build a 'bubble butt' without doing any squats    Destiny performs the following two-part sequence four times per week along with two HIIT sessions for cardio Part OneWearing a resistance band above the knees, do four sets of 20 reps of:clamsside-to-side steps hip thrusts kickbacks single-leg glute bridgesPart TwoDo three sets of 12-15 reps of:barbell hip thrusts cable kickbacks step-ups with overhead cable griprear foot elevated dumbbell split squats barbell walking lunge kickbacksstiff leg dumbbell deadlifts   HIIT for cardioDo five sets of 15 reps of each exercise without breaks Kettlebell swingsAlternate side dumbbell plank rowsStep ups (both sides)Mountain climbersDumbbell forward lunges
