 Kim also said North Korea hopes its 'legitimate concerns' will be given due respect, a reference to its desire for security guarantees and a possible peace treaty to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War.He also credited Chinese President Xi Jinping with helping reduce regional tensions, saying 'the Korean Peninsula situation has been easing since last year, and China's important role in this process is obvious to all.' Xi told Kim that that China supports the U.S.-North Korea summits and hopes the two sides 'will meet each other halfway.'           From left: Kim Jong-un's wife Ri Sol-ju, the North Korean leader, the Chinese President, and Xi's wife Peng Liyuan, in Beijing during the summit          North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Chinese President Xi Jinping greet children waving the flags of North Korea in Beijing during Kim's two-day visit          Kim Jong-un receives a present from a girl outside his distinctive green and yellow train, on which he arrived in Beijing and left again yesterday          Kim Jong-un examines an item as he walks with officials during the two-day visit in Beijing        Trump and Kim met in Singapore last June for the first-ever leaders' meeting between their nations, but there has been a standoff ever since. North Korea has not conducted any test launches or detonations in more than a year but has shown little intention of abandoning the nuclear programmes. Kim expressed frustration in his New Year's address over the lack of progress in negotiations with Washington since the Singapore summit. According to North Korea's own news reports Kim told Xi that the North remains unchanged in its push to seek a negotiated resolution of the nuclear standoff. The Chinese leader has yet to visit North Korea since taking office in 2012. Trump's own relationship with his Chinese counterpart has frayed over the U.S.-China trade war. During the summit Kim met with Xi at the Great Hall of the People on Tuesday after a welcoming ceremony. Later on Tuesday Xi gave a grand banquet for Kim, his wife Ri Sol Ju and other visiting North Korean officials.          The two leaders pose in Beijing, where they discussed North Korea's nuclear standoff with the United States ahead of a possible second summit between Kim and Donald Trump          Kim and Xi lead round-table discussions at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, with the flags of North Korea and China placed at one end of the table       North Korean leader Kim Jong Un waves from the train which brought him to Beijing
