Song Tao (L), head of the International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China, will travel to North Korea on FridayOn Wednesday, Beijing announced that Song Tao, a senior diplomat with the Communist Party of China, would visit North Korea on Friday.The official purpose of Song's travel is to provide an overview of the 19th Party Congress, according to state-owned news service Xinhua.Liu Yunshan is the last Chinese diplomat to have met with Kim, the Associated Press reported.Trump said Friday during a flight from Beijing to Da Nang, Vietnam, that he had a long talk with Xi in which he told the foreign leader he'd like to him him 'ratchet it up' on North Korea. 'I think he's doing that,' the U.S. president said.'We were together for hours. And we get along very well,' Trump told journalists. 'And we talked a lot about North Korea. We talked about a lot of things. We talked a lot about North Korea.'The White House did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment on Song's trip to Pyongyang.As he fumed in Washington with time on his hands, the White House announced that Trump would be giving a set of remarks on his trip that he'd hinted at Tuesday but had been expected a day later on Thursday afternoon. In tweets on Wednesday prior to the schedule change, when he had nothing on his public schedule following his 12-day, five-nation feting in East Asia where he was welcomed with red carpet after red carpet, Trump bragged about his foreign policy acumen.         Shortly before the tirade, China said it would deploy a special envoy to North Korea a week to the day after the visit to Beijing that Trumps is calling a bonanza. It's the first time in two years that Chinese representation will be in Pyongyang         Chinese President Xi Jinping (L) holds a grand ceremony to welcome U.S. President Donald Trump at the square outside the east gate of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China         Trump said Friday during a flight from Beijing to Da Nang, Vietnam, that he had a long talk with Xi in which he told the foreign leader he'd like to him him 'ratchet it up' on North Korea. 'I think he's doing that,' the U.S. president said         Hours after he arrived in Beijing, Trump was raving about the grandiose welcome ceremony and the exclusive tour of the Forbidden City that Xi put on for himHe mentioned trade specifically in an apparent reference to the scrutiny he has received for his empty-handed return from China.Trump secured $250 billion in tentative agreements for U.S. companies - but the contracts were paper thin. Assertions that South Korea and Vietnam are on the verge of purchasing massive amounts of U.S. military equipment were also yet to materialize. Hours after he arrived in Beijing, Trump was raving about the grandiose welcome ceremony and the exclusive tour of the Forbidden City that Xi put on for him.He told business leaders during a signing ceremony that he does not blame China - a country he once accused of 'raping' the U.S. economy - for taking advantage of past administrations' incompetency.'We have an amazing feeling toward each other. And he's for China; I'm for USA. You know, it's one of those things. But we have a great feeling,' he said of Xi as he traveled from Beijing to Vietnam.Trump said he spoke to Xi about China's intellectual property theft, which the president acknowledged has a price tag of about about $300 billion a year.'We talked about it. But I said, we're friends, but this is a different administration than you've had for the last 30 years,' he said, bringing South Korea and Japan's trade deficits into the discussion. 'And I don't blame any of those countries. I blame the people that we had representing us who didn't know what they were doing. Because they should have never let it happen.'       Trump's stunning about-face on Chinese railroading of U.S. businesses was just the beginning.He revealed during the same talk with reporters that he thinks Putin is sincere when he says he does not have knowledge of the Kremlin's election meddling and does not believe it happened.If it weren't for the allegations of collusion between his campaign and Russia, Trump said he and Putin would have continued to develop 'a very good feeling for each other.'Trump also said the United States' relationship with the Philippines is 'better than ever' after a meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte. The foreign government says Trump did not press Duterte on human rights during their talk and the country's reported extrajudicial killings.'I've made a lot of friends at the highest level, whether it's China and the incredible opening they gave us -- that unbelievable evening. People really have never seen anything like it -- going to the Forbidden City and a theater that hadn't been open in over 100 years, and the level of talent that we watched. It was really something special,' Trump said as he was leaving the Philippines.He told reporters on the flight back to Washington that he'd had a 'great trip' and he'd 'done a really fantastic job.''It's also been really good, in terms of North Korea and getting everybody together. I think their acts are all together. China has been excellent,' Trump said.       Trump said that Xi committed 'to stopping the nuclearization of North Korea.''That's a big statement. He made that statement, and a lot of people didn't -- they didn't pick that up,' Trump assessed. 'I said, wow, that's a big statement.'  Continuing, Trump said, 'He's the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. Some people say more powerful than Mao. With that being said, I really believe he's a good person, he's a good man, he wants to do right, he's representing his people. He's strong, he's very strong. But you know, you look at some of what you saw was very impressive. It was very impressive.'In Beijing, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson insisted 'there's no space' between the United States' and China's 'objectives' in North Korea.'President Trump, our President, has been very clear with President Xi that he takes the view that you are a very powerful neighbor of theirs; you account for 90-plus percent of their economic activity; you're a strong man -- you can, I'm sure, solve this for me,' Tillerson said. 'And so he was very clear with him and said he believes it can be solved.'
