 Meeting at the Prime Minister's official country residence late last night President Xi told Mr Cameron the EU was a key 'strategic partner' for China, the country's foreign ministry.In a statement it said President Xi had told the PM that 'China hopes to see a prosperous Europe and a united EU, and hopes Britain, as an important member of the EU, can play an even more positive and constructive role in promoting the deepening development of China-EU ties'.Former environment secretary Owen Paterson said: ‘I think this is a matter for the British people to decide in a referendum and not for US President Barack Obama or the President of China. We want to have a market relationship with Europe, we do not want to be part of a political entity.’In July, President Obama was criticised for saying Britain needed to stay in the EU to have influence on the world stage.Downing Street said the issue of the EU formed only a small part of the talks between Mr Cameron and Mr Xi. A No10 spokesman said: ‘I don’t think it was a particularly large part of the discussion.‘The PM’s view on Europe is very, very well known. He has set out very clearly that there is an important case for us to renegotiate with Europe.’Recent polls have suggested support for leaving – dubbed ‘Brexit’ – has increased as Europe’s migrant crisis has deepened.Robert Oxley, spokesman for Vote Leave, said: ‘Pro-EU campaigners claimed that holding a referendum on the EU would kill off investment and yet the Chinese premier is here on a state visit.                 President Xi's intervention into a sensitive political issue, which is extremely rare for a Chinese leader, is likely to be welcomed by Mr Cameron and supporters of Britain remaining in the EU       ‘The Chinese have just signed billions of pounds in business deals with the UK so they are clearly not that worried about the prospect of the UK leaving the EU. We would expect the PM to persuade other world leaders to help him with his lacklustre In campaign. We don’t think that the British public will be persuaded by these establishment figures. If we are going to... make things better here in the UK we need to Vote Leave.’Peter Wilding, director of the pro-EU British Influence campaign, said: ‘President Xi’s comment is a body blow to those who want the UK to leave – because he made it quite clear that China would prefer to deal with a UK inside the EU. This is similar to what Barack Obama thinks.‘They would rather deal with an EU of 500million people than a UK of 64million. This is the end of the hopes of the outers that the UK could negotiate a trade deal with China on our own if we left the EU.’British officials have been holding 'technical talks' with Brussels counterparts since June to begin work on the renegotiation.But Mr Cameron has tried to avoid details of any progress being made public.However, last week, he agreed he would put his demands in writing at the start of next month, ahead of a summit of all 28 EU members in December. China hopes to see a prosperous Europe and a united EU, and hopes Britain, as an important member of the EU, can play an even more positive and constructive role in promoting the deepening development of China-EU ties China's foreign ministry Mr Cameron had promised to get rules changed in order to stop migrant workers who come to Britain from other EU countries claiming child benefit and sending it home.But in a major blow to the PM yesterday, the European Court of Justice confirmed that parents living in one member state are entitled to claim the welfare payments and send them to their children living in another.The ruling came a day after one of the Government's most senior officials in the renegotiations warned that Mr Cameron will fail to get his key EU demand to stop benefits being handed out to working migrants who have been in the country for less than four years.The diplomat said he expected there would only be an agreement to restrict welfare payments for a matter of months because of fierce resistance from other EU countries.Ahead of last night's talks at Chequers Mr Cameron took President Xi to his favourite pub for a pint and a portion of fish and chips.The trip to The Plough at Cadsden in Buckinghamshire lasted just 20 minutes, during which time they both ate and drank a Greene King IPA.Mr Xi sampled his long-awaited British fish and chips supper, and Mr Cameron - who paid for the drinks with a £10 note - said the meal was 'very good'.President Xi rounds off his four-day state visit to Britain with a trip to Manchester today.He will tour a football academy to meet former players and watch a training match during the visit, which will also see the announcement of a new air route between China and Manchester and a series of investment deals.President Xi will be joined by Mr Cameron, who is seeking to promote the Government's Northern Powerhouse agenda.During the visit to Manchester City's football academy, the two leaders will meet the team's former players Patrick Vieira and Mike Summerbee, and ex-Manchester United stars Gary Neville and Denis Law - nicknamed The King - whose glittering career also involved spells at City.The president and Mr Cameron will also visit the National Football Museum where they will witness former City player and Chinese international Sun Jihai being inducted into the hall of fame.The former City defender, who made 130 appearances for the club between 2002 and 2008 and was the first Chinese player to score a goal in the Premier League, is to receive an honorary award for boosting the popularity of the English game in China.
