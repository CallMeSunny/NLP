China sets aside rancor, offers Japan condolences for quakes By Associated Press   Published: 06:34 BST, 19 April 2016  |  Updated: 06:34 BST, 19 April 2016                e-mail         BEIJING (AP) â€” Chinese President Xi Jinping has extended his condolences to Japan's Emperor Akihito over the country's recent deadly earthquakes in a brief respite from the usual rancor between Beijing and Tokyo.Reports Tuesday of Xi's comments said he also expressed "sincere wishes" that the Japanese people might speedily overcome difficulties and rebuild their homes."On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I extend my sympathies for those who have died and condolences to their families and those who were injured," Xi said in the message issued late Monday.Xi made no mention of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is widely loathed in China over his conservative views on history and moves to strengthen Japan's defense.High-level Chinese-Japanese ties have been largely frozen since Japan nationalized a string of uninhabited East China Sea islands claimed by China in 2012, setting off violent anti-Japanese protests in several Chinese cities. The move infuriated many Chinese, who feel Japan has never properly atoned for its brutal World War II invasion.More than 40 people were killed in two strong earthquakes that struck southern Japan last week.
