 Feb 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet next month, a U.S. Department of Agriculture official said at an industry event on Wednesday, as the two countries try to hammer out a deal to end a tit-for-tat tariff battle. The presidents are expected to meet "sometime in March," said USDA Deputy Secretary Stephen Censky at a renewable fuels industry conference. U.S. negotiators are in Beijing this week to discuss a trade pact that would avert an increase in U.S. duties on Chinese goods scheduled for March 2.
