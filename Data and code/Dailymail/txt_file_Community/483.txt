If not, the club would send the youth team' says GiroudThe Arsenal manager was in combative mood during Tuesday night's pre-match press conference.'We've won everywhere in Europe, we can win here,' he said. He's right, they can.

No,' insisted Giroud, who is likely to start against the Greeks.'But this group was within our reach and we put ourselves in a difficult position losing our two first games.'Now, we have the opportunity to show our mental strength.'We'll have to leave aside the atmosphere because it's going be a very hot game. We need to be at 100 per cent.'In this kind of game, 95 per cent won't be enough.'   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Why Arsene Wenger is in danger of losing one of his biggest...
