It's the ancient art of telling your fortune from numbers hidden in your life. Here, in the concluding part of our fascinating numerology series, how they hold the key to your character... As a numerologist — someone who predicts the future using the significant numbers and letters in people’s lives — I’m often asked if I can forecast things as specific as the Lotto results or a person’s time of death.The answer is no. But numerology is invaluable in helping you navigate the years that lie ahead of you.Key to this is an understanding of who you are as a person right now. And today I want to show you how to get further insight into your personality — and those of your nearest and dearest.Scroll down for video          Numerology is based on the idea that, just like everything else in the universe, the numbers and letters significant to each of us have an energy which determines who we are as people and how our lives will unfoldWhile finding the other numbers in your numerological chart have involved a little calculation on your part, this is more straightforward.All you need do is look up the day of the month on which you were born in the key below.Where the day in question has only one digit — as is the case for those born between the 1st and the 9th of the month — the characteristics shown are drawn directly from the energy of the individual numbers in question.For example, you may remember that when we were looking at Life Path Numbers on Saturday, people with a Number 9 in their chart tend to be compassionate, kind and understanding. And, as you’ll see, similar qualities are seen in those born on the 9th of the month.Where the number has two digits — as it does for anyone born beyond the 9th of each month — we often see a combination of the qualities associated with each of the two numerals.
