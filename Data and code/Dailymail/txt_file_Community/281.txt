The exact pairs the players are accused of stealing have not been reported.          (From left) UCLA's LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley, Jalen Hill and Kris Wilkes pose for a picture before flying to China for Friday's opener against Georgia Tech in Shanghai. Ball, Riley, and Hill were arrested and accused of shoplifting in Hangzhou, where they will remain indefinitely         The three freshman basketball players are reportedly confined to Hyatt Hotel in HanzhouThey were taken into police custody on Tuesday morning and released early on Wednesday on condition they remain at their hotel during the legal process, a source told Reuters.Often China will deport foreigners suspected of having committed relatively minor offenses. In a video posted to Twitter by ESPN's Arash Markazi, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo and Los Angeles Lakers rookie Lonzo, was dismissive of the incident.'He'll be fine,' said the usually outspoken LaVar. 'Everyone's making it a big deal. It ain't that big a deal.' LaVar Ball said, "I'm going to wait until I get more intel on what's going on" before he comments on LiAngelo Ball's arrest but said he's not worried. "He'll be fine," he said. "Everyone's making it a big deal. It ain't that big a deal." pic.twitter.com/E7QuMaMsNU— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) November 8, 2017 The Bruins were preparing to open the season against Georgia Tech in Shanghai on Friday when the three players were reportedly interrogated and arrested. All three could face between three and 10 years in prison, Chinese lawyers told Yahoo Sports. 'I would say they could be in quite a bit of trouble if they have solid proof that they shoplifted,' William Nee, a Hong Kong-based researcher of the Chinese court system for Amnesty International, told Yahoo Sports. 'However, part of it will depend on whether their lawyers, the university, or the U.S. consulate can advocate and negotiate on their behalf.'According to ESPN, around 20 police officers arrived at the Hyatt Hangzhou at around 8 a.m. on Tuesday and spoke with players from both UCLA and Georgia Tech about an incident at a nearby Louis Vuitton store. The players were allegedly kept in a room for hours without being allowed to speak with coaches.         President Donald Trump's (right) two days with Xi (left) included a tour of the Forbidden City, as well as a state dinner and several meetings in which the two leaders discussed North Korea's nuclear weapons program and trade. There was no public mention of the UCLA shoplifting case'They weren't messing around,' one source told ESPN. 'The kids were scared.'Considered the lowest-rated recruit of UCLA's freshman class, LiAngelo was given three out of five stars on ESPN's college basketball recruiting page, which criticized his lack of lateral quickness and overall defense. The scouting report did credit LiAngelo with being a good shooter with an improving post game. Lonzo's rookie season has been up and down so far. He's averaging just 8.8 points a game, although he does rank second among all rookies with 6.9 assists a game. While Lonzo currently plays for the 5-5 Lakers, younger brother LaMelo was taken out of Chino Hills High School so he can be made into 'the best basketball player ever,' according to father LaVar.LaVar told The Los Angeles Times in early October that LaMelo, a junior, would leave Chino Hills High School so he would have fewer distractions and better focus. LaMelo plays on LaVar's traveling team, Big Baller Brand, which LaVar also coaches.Last season, LaMelo drew national attention by scoring 92 points in a game for Chino Hills.  LaVar's Big Baller Brand also makes shoes, ranging in price from $220 to one pair that costs $995.Lonzo currently has his own signature shoe while LaMelo's is on its way. The MB1, which costs $395, is available for pre-order and will ship in December.According to Markazi, the Big Baller Brand will open two pop-up shops in China: one in Shanghai on Friday and another in Hong Kong on November 14. There is a concern that LaMelo's shoe deal could affect his eligibility at UCLA.                  LaVar Ball (middle, back), LaMelo Ball (left) and LiAngelo Ball (right) pose for a portrait with Lonzo Ball (seated), who was drafted second overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in June
