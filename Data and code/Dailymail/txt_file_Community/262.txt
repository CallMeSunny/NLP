It was never meant to be like this. Euro 2016 is the party all the famous names are invited to, UEFA even expanded the capacity so they could all fit in.And yet, as the names are checked off the star-studded guest list, Holland could still be left shivering outside on the pavement.After a qualification campaign that has lurched from one disaster to another, the Dutch find themselves in a doomsday scenario ahead of the concluding couplet of matches this weekend.         The magnitude of Holland's qualifying predicament hits Robin van Persie after defeat in Turkey last month         Holland's qualification campaign has lurched from one calamity to another and their fate rests elsewhere         Dutch coach Danny Blind oversees training at the Astana Arena, where Holland play Kazakhstan on Saturday         With Iceland the Czech Republic already through, Holland are playing for third and a play-off berth  HOLLAND'S DISASTROUS RESULTS   September 9, 2014 Czech Republic (A) 1-2October 10 Kazakhstan (H) 3-1October 13 Iceland (A) 0-2November 16 Latvia (H) 6-0March 28, 2015 Turkey (H) 1-1June 12 Latvia (A) 2-0September 3 Iceland (H) 0-1September 6 Turkey (A) 0-3October 10 Kazakhstan (A)October 13 Czech Republic (H)  There is a very real possibility that Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder, Daley Blind and the rest of the boys in Oranje will be watching festivities in France on their television sets next summer.Holland's fate is out of their hands as they make the long 4,422 mile journey from Amsterdam to Astana - a city further east than Iran and most of Pakistan - to play Kazakhstan on Saturday evening.Fourth in Group A with only third-place and a play-off berth up for grabs, Holland are reliant on Turkey slipping up in their remaining games against the already-qualified Czech Republic and Iceland.If things progress that far, Holland host the Czechs in what could be a dramatic evening in the Amsterdam ArenA on Tuesday - a fairly tough proposition even at the best of times.To put things simply, if Holland lose to Kazakhstan, Turkey would only need a draw against the Czechs to qualify and dump Van Persie and Co out.To add to the unfavourable permutations and long-haul travel to the heart of Asia, coach Danny Blind - promoted from assistant to the top job when Guus Hiddink quit in June - has an injury crisis to deal with.Holland could feel a pretty strong XI from sidelined players at the moment, with notable absentees including captain Arjen Robben, midfielders Davy Klaassen and Kevin Strootman, and defensive trio Daryl Janmaat, Ron Vlaar and Stefan de Vrij.

He will win his 100th cap if played in Astana and is only one goal shy of an international half-century.'I had different circumstances in mind for such a milestone,' he admitted to Dutch paper De Telegraaf.'Don't ask me why, but I believe Turkey will definitely spill points in their last two games. The Turkish players at Fenerbahce are all confident they will progress, but I have no doubt they will slip up.'It is not important how we win, so long as we win.'

   As a Galatasaray player, Sneijder will also take plenty of flak if Turkey make it through and he is in no doubt as to the gravitas of the situation.'We need to get six points, it's as simple as that,' he said. 'We've said a couple of times now that there are two finals on the programme, but now it really has come to that.'Another preoccupation for Sneijder is that his pregnant wife Yolanthe could go into labour soon, forcing him to return home from the Holland camp.'When the contractions start, I'm gone,' he said. 'My wife Yolanthe insisted that I go to the national team, and I don't know what I would have done if she hadn't.'The fact we're even at this 'two finals' stage is astonishing, given that the top two sides in each group make it through to the 24-team tournament automatically along with the third-placed team with the best record.UEFA expanded the size of the European Championships from 16 to 24 teams for the first time, yet Holland's best case scenario remains the lottery of next month's play-offs.

Is it that finishing third at the World Cup made them complacent, or were they just over-rated in the first place?Either way, this qualifying campaign has seen losses home and away to Iceland, just one point taken off Turkey (that through a last-minute equaliser) and an away loss to the Czechs. With those results, frankly, they don't deserve to be at the party.         Robin van Persie's unforgettable header in Holland's 5-1 rout of Spain at the World Cup seems a long time ago         Louis van Gaal's side reached the semi-finals of the World Cup but that is a distant memory now         Holland's European Championship dream could come to an end in the cavernous Astana Arena         Wesley Sneijder (left) and Robin van Persie (right) will carry Dutch hopes of a great escape this weekend          Memphis Depay is challenged by his Manchester United team-mate Daley Blind (right) during trainingThe cold, harsh post-mortem of this last year will reveal serious cracks disguised by the occasional orange flash of brilliance.As has been widely remarked, Holland seem to have a missing generation - a core of players between the ages of 25 and 30, entering their prime, who possess the talent to drag them out of difficult situations.What Hiddink and Blind had and have is an ageing generation of superstars on the wrong side of 30 - Van Persie, Robben, Sneijder, Klaas Jan Huntelaar - and players aspiring to be them like Memphis Depay and Georginio Wijnaldum.These players in their early twenties still lack the nous and experience to do it all by themselves but they will no doubt flower in the 2018 World Cup in Russia and 2020 Euros across the continent.On top of this, they have suffered plenty of bad luck along the way, of which the current spate of injuries is just the latest.Robben missed last month's qualifiers, while the injury-plagued Kevin Strootman has not represented his country since March 2014.Yet bad luck alone cannot explain away this abysmal qualifying campaign. The near-future looks far from bright for the Oranje.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Euro 2016 state of play: Holland and Sweden in danger of...
