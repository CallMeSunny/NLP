Donald Trump has been mercilessly ridiculed on Twitter for appearing to imitate the Chinese President's accent when discussing criminal sentences for drug dealers.Social media users were quick to pick up on Trump's change in accent when he told reporters of a conversation he had with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a press conference at the White House.He claimed he spoke with President Xi at a trade summit in Argentina about opioid imports to the U.S. which kill 'tens of thousands of people.'                     Donald Trump (left) was accused of racism on Twitter after appearing to mimick the accent of Chinese President Xi Jinping (right) as he recalled a conversation they had about drug dealers         Twitters users were quick to call out Trump on his apparent accent change during his press conference in the Rose Garden He said he asked the President to put the prescription pain-killer Fentanyl on their criminal list of drugs. Trump told reporters: 'With their criminal list a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty. Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called "how about a fine?"'.However his accent appeared to change and soften when he recalled what President Xi told him in response to a question, causing Twitter to go into meltdown.

 He said: 'When I asked President Xi, do you have a drug problem?, [he responded] "no, no, no."Trump continued: 'I said you have 1.4 billion people, what do you mean you have no drug problem?,  "No we don't have a drug problem."'I said why?, to which Trump said President Xi responded: 'Death penalty, we give death penalty to people that sell drugs.'         Trump spoke at a press conference and was speaking about trade talks with China when he appeared to use a Chinese accent          Twitter went into overdrive when Trump's dialect changed as he mimicked President Jinping                                                               'End of problem.' He later claimed that the President had agreed to put Fentanyl on China's 'list of deadly, deadly drugs', adding that 'the penalty his death.'Trump then bizarrely said that giving the death penalty to drug dealers was 'one of the things' that excited him most about the U.S. trade deal with China which is currently being negotiated. The exchange led to eagle-eyed Twitter users calling him out for appearing to 'use a Chinese accent.'Matt Carter tweeted: 'Is Trump recommending the death penalty? And is he mimicking an Asian accent?         Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping (pictured) shake hands during a press conference at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing last November Jack Bacon also commented: 'TRUMP IS USING AN ASIAN ACCENT WHILE QUOTING THE CHINESE PRESIDENT!!!.'Em Carlson wrote: 'Trump isn't racist? How about that racist Chinese? This is more than sickening. He is INSANE!.'Tom McCarthy also said: 'That's right, Trump seemed to be putting on – an accent?  as he supposedly quoted Xi.'A lot of people accused Trump of being racist and said they were even more shocked by his comments claiming that introducing the death penalty for drug dealers 'excited' him.
