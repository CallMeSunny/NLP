Japan says PM Abe will meet China's Xi at Jakarta summit By Reuters   Published: 04:03 BST, 22 April 2015  |  Updated: 04:03 BST, 22 April 2015                e-mail         TOKYO, April 22 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of an Asia-Africa summit in Indonesia, a Japanese government official said.The talks would be the latest sign of a thaw in relations between the world's second and third biggest economies.Sino-Japanese ties have chilled in recent years due to feuds over the two neighbours' wartime past as well as territorial rows and regional rivalry. A meeting between the two leaders could promote a cautious rapprochement that began when Abe and Xi met at a summit in Beijing late last year. (reporting by Linda Sieg)
