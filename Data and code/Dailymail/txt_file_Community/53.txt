       It seemed like Gemma's relaxing day at the spa did her the world of good as she skated around the rink with apparent ease. Earlier in the day, the TOWIE legend enjoyed an array of treatments at Champneys saying the producers had sensed she needed to chill out. Taking to Instagram Stories, Gemma said:  'This is reality right now, I’m so ill but I’m at Dancing On Ice.          Showtime: Clad in sportswear, Gemma pulled off a number of steps on the ice, from toe taps to an impressive arabesque         Back to her best: It seemed like Gemma's relaxing day at the spa did her the world of good as she skated around the rink with apparent ease         R&R: Earlier in the day, the TOWIE legend enjoyed an array of treatments at Champneys saying the producers had sensed she needed to chill out       'I’ve got to keep quiet, but the lovely producers at Dancing On Ice have brought us to Champneys. When they saw what I look like they were like...'Gemma then flaunted her battered and bruised knee.The GC's new-found confidence comes just days after she had to be consoled by host Holly Willoughby after receiving the lowest score of the night following her performance to Look What You Made Me Do by Taylor Swift. Dressed as the Evil Queen, Gemma said through sobs her 'legs had turned to jelly' and she felt paralysed with fear as soon as she took to the rink.          Building confidence: She captioned the post: 'Rough cut off working on Sunday’s routine @themattevers @woo2kaz @thedanwhiston you really helped me build my confidence today                Overwhelmed: She added: 'I can’t thank you enough ....very rough cut but I’m not giving up yet .... and the PUBLIC SUPPORT is OVERWHELMING beyond belief THANKYOU'She said through sobs: 'My nerves have gone since the fall. I’m really upset. My legs are like jelly, they’ve just gone.'  Providing some encouragement, Ashley Banjo said: 'One of my favourite things is that when you fell, you fell trying. You’ve knocked your confidence. Better to go out and try and fall, then not try.'Gemma and judge Jason Gardiner famously fell out on the show a few weeks ago when she accused the choreographer of "selling stories" on her but this week, Jason gave the television personality her highest score from all the judges, a four. Her rival even offered some kind words: 'I did give you the highest score, the beginning needed stronger execution, you really need to incorporate the evil queen characterisation, the GC queen wasn't there. It was like she left the building.'
