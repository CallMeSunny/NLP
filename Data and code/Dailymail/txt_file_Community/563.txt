 BEIJING, Oct 25 (Reuters) - China's Communist Party revealed its new top leadership helmed by President Xi Jinping on Wednesday, breaking with recent precedent by failing to include a clear successor among the seven-man line-up. Apart from Xi, Premier Li Keqiang was the only one to retain his spot amid sweeping changes on the Politburo Standing Committee, the height of power in China. Li Zhanshu, Zhao Leji, Han Zheng, Wang Huning and Wang Yang were promoted, replacing five retiring members including anti-corruption chief Wang Qishan, a key Xi ally.
