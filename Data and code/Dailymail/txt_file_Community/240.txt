Stomp into winter in a pair of platform boots like Kelly's

As Kelly Rowland showed while attending a Kanye West gig in Los Angeles, this winter's ankle boots are raising the bar. Pun intended. Hers, which are a highly covetable style from French label Vetements, are built with a two-inch platform and feature a five-inch heel.
If you fancy stomping high above the pavement make sure your pair, like Rowland's, is cut slim on the ankle. With a boot like this it is important to create a slim silhouette or the leg could be swallowed by this statement-making shoe. 
While this ex-Destiny's Child's member styled hers with jeans and a biker jacket we think it could look just as stylish and beguiling with a pretty little dress. 
While the Vetements boots are available to buy online now they bear a hefty price tag. For a more affordable solution look to Office and A.F. Vandervorst.
