As we bid farewell to 2015, we look back on a truly tumultuous year in British politics – and one in which the wider world has become an ever more volatile and dangerous place.It has been a year of the unexpected in which the certainties of those ‘in the know’ have been consistently confounded.David Cameron’s stunning election victory – against the predictions of virtually every pollster – ushered in the first majority Tory government for nearly two decades and left Labour in tatters.         Against pollsters' predictions: David Cameron’s stunning election victory left Labour in tatters. The Prime Minister is pictured with his wife Samantha entering 10 Downing Street following the Conservatives' win in MayDespite Ed Miliband’s belief that he was destined for Number 10, the electorate utterly rejected his pernicious brand of tax-and-spend Socialism. Then in the chaotic aftermath of defeat, the party turned in on itself by choosing an even more Left-wing leader in Jeremy Corbyn.Under Tory stewardship the British economy has continued to grow. There are now a record 31.3million people in work, unemployment is at its lowest since the crash, wages are rising in real terms and the number of children in workless households has fallen by half a million.

The barbarians of Islamic State have cut a bloody swathe through the Middle East and brought murderous terror to the beaches of Tunisia, the magazine offices, cafes and concert halls of Paris and the suburbs of Brussels.That Britain didn’t witness a major attack was thanks to the admirable vigilance of the security services – and a huge slice of luck.For we should be in no doubt, as last night’s huge security presence at New Year celebrations underlined, we remain a prime target.         Problems within Labour: In the chaotic aftermath of defeat, the party turned in on itself by choosing an even more Left-wing leader in Jeremy CorbynMeanwhile, caught between IS and the ruthless forces of President Assad, more than 3 million refugees have fled Syria, many heading across the Mediterranean in leaky and overcrowded boats to reach the promised land of Europe.This surge of humanity has created huge tensions as EU member nations struggle to stem the tide.Barbed wire fences have been erected on external borders and the Schengen agreement, allowing free movement between states, is close to collapse.In Britain, annual net migration soared to more than 330,000 in 2015 – a patently unsustainable level – with hundreds of thousands more heading our way.And it is this migration crisis that brings us to the great challenge for 2016.The EU referendum – which will determine our political destiny for a generation or more – is now expected to go ahead this summer.

He can either try to fool the public by presenting meaningless concessions from the EU as a resounding victory, or come clean and admit that Brussels is simply not interested in radical reform.The Mail believes voters are entitled to hear the unvarnished truth before making their momentous decision, which also means lifting the gag on Eurosceptic Cabinet ministers.In his New Year message, Mr Cameron says the nation must decide whether we are ‘stronger and better off’ in the EU or on our own. Quite so.There are honest and powerful arguments on both sides and they must all be heard without further delay.Above all, Britain simply has to win back control over its borders – whether by negotiating real change in EU terms or parting company with Brussels.As this paper has said repeatedly, Mr Cameron has the opportunity to be a great reforming Tory Prime Minister. This is the year he must grasp it.And with that thought, we wish all our readers a happy and peaceful New Year.
