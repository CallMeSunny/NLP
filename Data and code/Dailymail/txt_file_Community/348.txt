          All dressed up: In marked contrast to his usual scruffy dress code, the Labour leader ended speculation by opting for traditional attire of a white tie and tails at Buckingham Palace last nightIn an exchange the Prime Minister clearly found awkward, the Labour leader told him: 'It was difficult because, erm, that’s his ex-wife who is, erm, apparently an ex-prostitute'.David Cameron, who nodded and looked slightly embarrassed, replied simply: 'Oh' - before steering the conversation on to self employment levels being 'down gradually'. Mr Corbyn is then seen nodding and replies: 'That’s right, absolutely, that would be more interesting'.During the exchange the Labour leader also cracked a joke to the Prime Minister who burst out laughing.He said: 'I remember I lost my glasses. (At a) school party, I must’ve been about three at the time'.The punchline that followed could not be lip-read but Mr Cameron found it very funny.The exchange has been analysed by a number of lip reading experts, including Tina Lannin, for MailOnline. Neither camp would comment on the identity of the woman today - Mr Corbyn's spokesman denied the Labour leader said 'prostitute' but refused to say what he had said.Last night the Labour leader bowed to convention and wore formal white tie evening dress to the state banquet.In marked contrast to his usual scruffy dress code, the Labour leader ended speculation by opting for traditional attire at Buckingham Palace. He also met the Queen for the first time, apparently shaking her hand, but it is not clear if he bowed.David Cameron, the former Eton and Oxford student, looked much more at ease in his white tie than his opposite number.Earlier, Mr Corbyn had held a private meeting with President Xi ‎Jinping at which he raised China’s human rights record and the plight of the British steel industry.The Labour leader held what the party described as ‘cordial and constructive’ discussions with Xi Jinping at Buckingham Palace, where he attended a state banquet.It had been suggested that he would use the formal function to raise the contentious issues if no private meeting could be arranged.But Labour’s description of the 30-minute meeting indicates that human rights and steel were discussed far more briefly than other issues such as ‘the remarkable Chinese achievements in poverty reduction’.                 Meeting: Earlier Mr Corbyn had held a private meeting with President Xi ‎Jinping at which he raised China’s human rights record and the plight of the British steel industry - but praised his work on povertyMr Corbyn praised the Chinese regime for lifting more than 600million people out of poverty and suggested there were ‘lessons’ for the world on ‘human development’.As he entered the room via the adjoining Bow Room, Mr Corbyn was announced loudly by a page as ‘The Leader of the Opposition’.  WHAT THE PM AND JEREMY CORBYN ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE SAID    Jeremy Corbyn (JC): 'It was difficult because, erm, that’s his ex-wife who is, erm, apparently an ex-prostituteDavid Cameron (DC): Ohhhh (throws head back)DC: But seriously, self employment has changed down graduallyJC: That’s right, absolutely, that would be more interesting   The pair shook hands cordially with Mr Corbyn placing his other hand on top and telling Mr Xi: ‘It’s very nice to meet you. I look forward to our meeting.’Mr Corbyn introduced his small delegation to the Communist leader including shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn and shadow business secretary Angela Eagle, who also shook hands with Mr Xi.The Labour leader and the president took their seats in identical chairs as Mr Xi began speaking at length through an interpreter telling Mr Corbyn: ‘It is indeed a great pleasure to meet you’.He expressed his congratulations to Mr Corbyn on his election as Labour leader and said ‘We stand ready to work together with Britain’ on financial matters and on friendship.Some nine Chinese officials had already taken their places their room before the press were ushered out of the meeting. The Labour MP was dressed in a white striped shirt, burgundy tie and fawn jacket.A Labour spokesman said the subjects discussed included ‘the history of links between the UK, the Labour Party and China, in particular the huge contribution and sacrifice of the Chinese people in the struggle against fascism during the Second World War and the Labour Party’s commitment to build constructively on that history’.The statement continued: ‘Jeremy also raised the issues of human rights and the impact of Chinese imports on the UK steel industry. It was agreed there should be further discussion of co-operation on climate change and cultural exchanges and these issues at a meeting between him, shadow cabinet colleagues and Vice Minister Wang Chao later in the week.’
