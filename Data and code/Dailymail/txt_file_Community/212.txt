'Drastic Dave': The new chief executive warned of major reforms to all parts of the company  Reforms under previous boss Phil Clarke, who was let go earlier in the summer, have failed to gain traction.Lewis, who spent 27 years at consumer goods giant Unilever, has been parachuted into the boardroom a month earlier than planned after new figures revealed the depth of the malaise at Britain’s biggest grocer.   More...

Tesco has lost market share, and is facing falling sales and slimmed profits.Over the weekend, one of Tesco’s biggest shareholders Harris Associates sold two thirds of its stake, saying that ‘risk factors’ threaten its future.Shares in the supermarket, which have lost 40 per cent of their value in 12 months, fell again yesterday to close 4.4p down at 225.55p – their lowest level since September 2003.
