Suu Kyi's date with destiny arrives as Myanmar votes By Afp   Published: 23:11 BST, 7 November 2015  |  Updated: 23:12 BST, 7 November 2015                e-mail         Myanmar goes to the polls Sunday in an historic election that could thrust Aung San Suu Kyi's pro-democracy party into power and pull the country away from the grip of the military.The Southeast Asian nation was ruled for five decades by a brutal junta that smothered opponents with violence, jail and political sleight of hand.But in 2011 the junta suddenly handed power to a semi-civilian government led by former generals.

I will be at the polling station before it opens," she added.But the 70-year-old Suu Kyi is barred from the presidency by a constitutional clause believed to have been inserted by the army drafters specifically to hamper her political rise.She has also faced international censure for failing to speak up for the country's embattled Muslim population -- especially the ethnic Rohingya in restive Rakhine State.But her supporters, many of whom will vote for the first time on Sunday, see an NLD win as a stepping stone to the fulfilment of her destiny to lead the country.Waves of people are believed to have travelled to their home constituencies to vote, in a sign of the enthusiasm for the landmark election.Some 30 million people are eligible to vote, with 91 parties standing in more than 300 constituencies.To win a majority -- and have free rein to chose its presidential candidate -- the NLD needs to secure just over two thirds of the contested seats, although it could still make alliances with smaller parties if it falls short.It is up against the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party, a military-backed behemoth stacked with former military cadres, including the bespectacled President Thein Sein a one-time top ranking junta general.The USDP needs only around a third to join up the military bloc to select its presidential nominee.The NLD also faces a formidable opponent in the shape of the army -- 25 percent of all parliamentary seats are reserved for military appointees.
