              Chinese President Xi Jinping, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and Macau Chief Executive Fernando Chui arrive for the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge in Zhuhai, Guangdong today         A view of the main entrance of the bridge section after the opening ceremony of the new bridge         The mega bridge links Hong Kong's Lantau island to Zhuhai and the gambling enclave of Macau         To construct the submerged tunnel, engineers had to drive more than 100 huge steel cylinders into the sandy bottom to form the foundations for the man-made islands, according to a previous report by Wired citing engineers of the project         The bridge, pictured on Tuesday night, is part of Beijing's plan to merge 11 cities in its southern region into one megalopolisHong Kong cars and drivers travelling over it 'must comply with the laws and regulations of the mainland', the city's transport department said. Building began in 2009 and has been dogged by delays, budget overruns, corruption prosecutions and the deaths of construction workers.The total price tag is unclear but some estimates run to over 100 billion yuan (£11 billion).          Building began in 2009 and has been dogged by delays, budget overruns, corruption prosecutions and the deaths of construction workers         Hong Kong residents will only be granted a licence to cross into Zhuhai by car if they meet highly selective criteria, including holding certain mainland government positionsTo get to either side of the bridge, vehicles will have to drive through the two man-made islands and the 6.7-kilometre (4-mile) -underwater tunnel and back out again.To construct the submerged tunnel, engineers had to drive more than 100 huge steel cylinders into the sandy bottom to form the foundations for the islands, according to a previous report by Wired citing engineers of the project.Without the tunnel, the bridge would have been so tall its pylons would exceed the height limits for structures near Hong Kong International Airport.  Secretary for Transport and Housing Frank Chan previously said travelling time between Zhuhai and the Hong Kong airport would be shortened to about 45 minutes from four hours.         Supporters of the project promote it as an engineering marvel that will also boost business and cut travel time         An interior view of the Hong Kong Port Passenger Clearance Building of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge       The total price tag has not been officially confirmed yet but some estimates run to over 100 billion yuan (£11 billion)         Cable cars travelling in front of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge off Lantau island in Hong Kong         The multi-billion-dollar bridge will open to traffic tomorrow at 9am local time, a day after the opening ceremonyHong Kong residents will only be granted a licence to cross into Zhuhai by car if they meet highly selective criteria, including holding certain mainland government positions or making major contributions to charities in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong.Most people will need to travel on coaches and buses.Some Hong Kong media reported that the physical condition of bus drivers would be monitored by cameras, including an alert sent if a driver yawns more than three times in 20 seconds.Online commenters in Hong Kong complained about the bridge's restricted access ahead of the launch.'Such a huge investment using the Hong Kong taxpayer's money... yet basically it is not open to us at all,' said one comment on the South China Morning Post website.But residents in Zhuhai welcomed it.'I think this bridge will bring great convenience to the whole area of Zhuhai, Hong Kong and Macao, and promote the economic development of the whole area of the Pearl River Delta,' resident Dang Zheiliang told AFP.          Officials expect the bridge to be in use for 120 years and say it will boost businesses by cutting travel time by 60 per cent         A shuttle bus attendant displays bus tickets at the Hong Kong Port Passenger Clearance Building of the crossing         To get to either side of the bridge, vehicles will have to drive through the man-made islands and the tunnel and back out again         The mega structure is the world's longest sea crossing and the sixth longest bridge on earth         A total of 420,000 tons of steel was used in the project, equivalent to 60 times the steel used to build the Eiffel TowerChina already lays claim to the record for the world's longest bridge of any kind - the Danyang-Kunshan Grand Bridge, a viaduct which is part of a high-speed rail line.Political analyst Willy Lam said the launch by Xi showed his support for Hong Kong's economic and political integration into the region, adding that the Pearl River Delta had long been the 'new growth pole of China'.It was also timed with a wider push to mark the 40th anniversary of China's economic reforms, against the backdrop of major challenges to the economy, including the escalating US-China trade conflict, Lam said.China will mark the anniversary in December of the 'reform and opening up' that was launched in 1978 under the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, moving away from a Maoist command economy and toward more market-oriented policies that transformed the country into the world's second-largest economy.
