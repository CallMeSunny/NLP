Donald Trump is looking forward to his first meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said.In talks with Mr Xi in Beijing on Sunday, Mr Tillerson said Mr Trump places a “very high value” on communications with the Chinese president via phone calls and exchanges of letters.Mr Tillerson said Mr Trump looked forward to “the opportunity of a visit in the future,” an apparent reference to unconfirmed reports of plans for the two men to meet in Florida next month.
