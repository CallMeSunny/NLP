I think that would be very negative. If you do that could you imagine the last two months for that player? He would never put a leg in or never challenge for the ball.'I don't agree with doing that, I know you can do that to keep a player for another 12 months but if you're not going to have a player 12 months down the line you need to start replacing him to have a stronger team.'

   Ramiro Funes Mori, meanwhile, is looking forward to fighting with Phil Jagielka for a place alongside Stones at the heart of Everton's defence, even though a calf injury to Seamus Coleman means Funes Mori and Jagielka are likely to be partners for the next four weeks.'He (Jagielka) was injured and in my moment I had to come in and play and take advantage of my time on the pitch,' he said.'He is the captain but I have done my job so he has to come back again and play for a spot. We will both have to fight for a place.'
