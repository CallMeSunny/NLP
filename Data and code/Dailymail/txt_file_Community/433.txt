Xi meets Taiwan opposition amid chill in government ties By Associated Press   Published: 00:25 BST, 2 November 2016  |  Updated: 00:25 BST, 2 November 2016                e-mail         BEIJING (AP) — Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Taiwan's opposition leader Tuesday, underscoring Beijing's message to the island's independence-leaning administration that it won't have access to the mainland's highest levels of power if it doesn't accept that Taiwan is part of China.Xi's meeting with Nationalist Party Chairwoman Hung Hsiu-chu at the Great Hall of the People in the heart of Beijing comes months after China cut off communication and exchanges with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen's administration. Diplomatically, China has also sought to isolate the island even more by having its representatives barred from international gatherings.While Xi referred to neither of those issues in his opening remarks before the media, he reiterated the importance of the "one-China principle" and the "'92 consensus," referring to an agreement reached that year reinforcing the principle. Beijing says the agreement forms the basis for all future contacts and exchanges — and insists Tsai explicitly endorse it.

The meeting underscored China's key message to the island's independence-leaning administration: The price of not recognizing Taiwan as part of the Chinese nation, as Beijing demands, is access to China's highest levels of power.

She is seen as the standard bearer for the party's more conservative pro-unification wing made up largely of those who followed Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan after the Communist military victory on the Chinese mainland in 1949 and their descendants.The Nationalists lost the presidency in January by a landslide, along with their parliamentary majority.On Monday, Hung and her delegation paid their respects at the mausoleum of original Nationalist leader and Chinese President Sun Yat-sen in the former capital of Nanjing. Sun, who is revered by both the Nationalists and the Communists, inspired the former enemies to "work together to fight for the national rejuvenation and improve people's livelihood," Hung said."We will create a prosperous future. (As long as) both sides of the Taiwan Strait cooperate and develop peacefully, our common wish will come true," she said in remarks carried by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.Despite the keen rivalry between the Nationalists and Tsai's DPP, Tsai's spokesman Alex Huang said the government sees "all normal people-to-people exchanges" with China in a positive light."The two sides should enhance mutual understanding and promote the peaceful development of bilateral relations through meaningful dialogue and exchanges without political preconditions," Huang was quoted as saying by Taiwan's official Central News Agency.However, he added that all political parties should "stand by the people" and support the government's policy on cross-strait ties. He also added that only the government was authorized to forge agreements on behalf of Taiwan.
