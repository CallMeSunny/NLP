Donald Trump's campaign launched a last-minute effort on Monday to engage in the kind of small-scale retail campaigning that has been a staple of lower-tier candidates' efforts for months in the Granite State.Trump continues to lead the field in the first-in-the-nation primary state by a comfortable 17 points in an average of February polls. But the fear of a second-place finish hangs heavy in the winter air.A repeat of Trump's disappointing showing in Iowa – a stunning development after weeks of polling dominance there – would put his unconventional political juggernaut on the ropes.So his campaign went back to basics on Monday with a speech and two town hall events before audiences that his expansive presidential bid would normally consider puny.         IT'S NOT YUUGE: Donald Trump campaigned in small spaces on Monday in New Hampshire         DOZENS, NOT THOUSANDS: Trump's typical overflow crowds were not in evidence, but it was by design as small-town New Hampshire's presidential primary elections approach on Tuesday In Salem, a Boston bedroom community, Trump fielded questions from an intimate gathering of less than 200 people in a room completely devoid of his name-branding.No giant 'Make America Great Again' banners. No TRUMP sign in blue and white on a stately podium.Just theatre in the round with a bare wooden stool and a microphone, and Trump asking people – like any other candidate – to vote for him.'I don't care if it snows or not. You are going to vote!' he told them. 'This is a destiny thing.'The Donald mostly walked around, fashioning his stump speech standards into answers shoehorned to fit questions from New Hampshirites as young as age 13.He told one youngster that he would 'look into colleges' as a way to reorient the nation's economy, calling higher education lending 'one of the only things he federal government makes money on.''We're going to lengthen it out,' he said of student loan repayment periods, 'and lower the costs.'

 Another question brought out his political brickbats.'He's a total stiff,' Trump said of Jeb Bush, repeating a broadside he leveled on a morning MSNBC broadcast.'He's like a child, He's like a spoiled child. He's spent $110 million on a failed campaign, and he's nowhere.''We have to get rid of the Bushes of this world,' Trump said. 'Guys like that will never straighten out the country.'On his call to reinstate waterboarding as an approved American interrogation technique in the war on terror, Trump puffed his chest out.'When we deal with these animals, we can't be soft and weak,' he said.And responding to a fan who said she wished she could vote for him 10 times, he hinted at a coming focus on voter ID laws that conservatives see as commonsensical and liberals deride as a racist voter-suppression plot.Without photo IDs required at polling places, Trump said, fraud runs rampant on Election Day.''I'm going to fight like hell to make sure I don't have some person ... voting 47 times for somebody,' he said.         MAKING AMERICA COZY AGAIN: Trump is finally embracing 'retail' politics after months of a wholesale approach to voter outreach         STILL AHEAD: The Donald leads New Hampshire Republican polls by an average of 17 points and hopes no one can mount a late surge strong enough to topple him on TuesdayWhile Trump seemed at ease in an unfamiliar format, the organizers dropped a stitch and forgot to recite the Pledge of Allegiance – interrupting Trump ten minutes into his event to check off that box.Team Trump's let's-get-small tactic was supposed to be put in place on Friday with a modest town hall in Londonderry, but a snowstorm closed down airport traffic and kept Trump in New York CIty.He was thought to be staying close to home instead of remaining in New Hampshire nonstop because his daughter Ivanka, 34, is nearing her due date to deliver a baby.The Londonderry event was put back on the calendar on Monday, coming third on the day's schedule. Between the two was a speech to the Manchester, N.H. Rotary Club in a venue that left no room at all for the press gaggle to covers all things Trump.By the time his third event came around, the snow was coming down again in buckets. The 69-year-old real estate developer has crushed the field in voter polls through a strategy of appealing simultaneously to two completely separate strata of Republicans.Moderate voters, he hopes, will embrace his willingness to cut deals with centrists and Democrats on policy issues that they see as outmoded right-wing shibboleths.       Meanwhile, he plays to red-meat conservatives with a bravado that resonates in their corner and gives them just enough policy agreement – dismantling the Obamacare system and walling off America's southern border – to keep them hooked.That strategy has so far been served well by addressing voters on the scale of thousands, not hundreds.Now he's testing the waters on the scale of dozens, hopeful that politically proud New Hampshire voters will see him making an effort to meet their eyes.One of them who was visiting New Hampshire from tony Greenwich, Connecticut asked Trump whether he would be comfortable telling a Syrian refugee family set to move into his town that they and their children weren't welcome.'I can look 'em in the face,' Trump said of the children, without batting an eye.'We don't know where their parents come from. ... They may be from Syria [but] they may be ISIS, they may be ISIS-related,' he said.
