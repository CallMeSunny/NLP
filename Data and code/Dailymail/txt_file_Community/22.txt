China’s Communist Party leader Xi Jinping has unveiled the line-up of the party’s highest body who will rule alongside him as he embarks on a second five-year term as party leader.As expected, Mr Xi was given a renewed mandate following the first meeting on Wednesday of the new Central Committee that was elected at the party’s twice-a-decade national congress.The party elevated Mr Xi’s status by inserting his name and dogma into the party’s constitution alongside past leaders Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, cementing his status as the country’s most powerful leader in decades.

Mr Li’s authority was widely viewed as having been undercut by Mr Xi’s accumulation of power over all sectors of government, although his continuing presence on the committee appears to speak to the high-regard in which he is held within the party.       Residents watch the announcements in BeijingThe make-up of the committee reflects Mr Xi’s efforts to foster party unity by striking a balance between different interest groups in the 89-million member organisation as he seeks to better position a reinvigorated party to dominate China’s affairs at home and abroad.They will assume responsibility for running the rubber-stamp legislature, the National People’s Congress and its advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, and assume a range of portfolios, including those responsible for propaganda, party discipline, ethnic and Taiwan affairs and science and technology.The other members are, in order of seniority: Li Zhanshu, director of the party’s General Office who serves as Mr Xi’s chief of staff; vice premier Wang Yang; Wang Huning, director of the party’s Central Policy Research Office; Zhao Leji, head of the Central Organisation Department responsible for job assignments; and Shanghai party leader Han Zheng, a veteran manager of the country’s financial hub.Mr Zhao is expected to head the much-feared corruption watchdog body, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.

While popular among ordinary Chinese, it is seen as part of a drive to purge his rivals and political opponents and boost supervision over the party at all levels.Alongside the campaign, Mr Xi has overseen one of the harshest crackdowns on civil society aimed at squelching dissent and activism among lawyers and rights advocates.The new leaders will face challenges that include reining burgeoning levels of debt seen as the biggest threat to economic stability and managing trade tensions with Washington and Europe over China’s excess production of steel and other goods.
