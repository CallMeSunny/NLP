So Husky, so palpably rehearsed, Tony Blair presented himself as some sort of restless penitent, likely for the rest of his mortal days to be self-tormented about Iraq.Our former prime minister called a press conference to give his reaction to the Chilcot Report. Dressed as though for mourning, he stepped towards a lectern in a drawing room of Admiralty House, Whitehall. A check of the voice. A shuttering gaze as his brow furrowed. 'I express more sorrow, regret and apology than you may ever know or can believe,' said Blair the victim.Verily, a desert boulder, so skilfully wrung, might bleed. Oh, the theatrics, the dry-mouthed pauses, those Derek Jacobi eyes with their squint at some distant destiny. Say what you like about Blair but he is a world-class tragedian, as silken an emoter as ever trod boards on Drury Lane. Scroll down for video                      So Husky, so palpably rehearsed: Tony Blair called a press conference to give his reaction to Chilcot Report                     Oh, the theatrics, the dry-mouthed pauses, those Derek Jacobi eyes with their squint at some distant destinyAnd yet he claimed that, as one of life's 'decision-makers', it had been his 'profound obligation' back in March 2003 – when he drove us to war – 'not to hide behind politics, expediency or even emotion'.Was that an echo of Kipling's poem 'If' when Mr Blair talked of the heavy duties demanded of prime ministers? A leader, he said, had 'to lead and not to shy away, to decide and not avoid decision, to discharge responsibility and not to duck it'. What would Kipling have made of Blair?

 His performance yesterday made for a remarkable but unredeeming spectacle, fascinating if only on a psychological level. Here was a once bellicose peacock stripped of its feathers. He still, even in this moment of political nakedness, managed to find notes of indignation, a persistent tenor tone of self-justification.He pleaded to be believed, begged his countrymen to accept he had not lied. With a swipe at cynicism, he said 'neither history nor the fierce and raucous conduct of modern politics, with all its love of conspiracy theory and its addiction to believing the worst of everyone, should falsify my motive'. At this point the voice went warbly. But a few seconds later it flared as he declared that he had thought the war to be 'right'.His hands started whirling and he raised those two index fingers in his admonishing way.                Say what you like Blair is a world-class tragedian, as silken an emoter as ever trod boards on Drury LaneHere was Blair the seer, Blair the superior being, Blair the 'decision-maker' who told president Bush 'I will be with you, whatever' a whole year before the false brinkmanship of the parliamentary vote on war. 'I did not mislead this country,' he said. His gestures as he spoke those words were eerily similar to those of Bill Clinton when he said 'I did not have sex with that woman'.An hour before Mr Blair's extraordinary performance, the Commons had gathered for a David Cameron statement on the Chilcot Report. Mr Cameron ran through his contribution with unexpected briskness. Perhaps the Establishment man in him (he was once ‘heir to Blair’, recall) disliked dwelling on the way Mr Blair had been found to have bypassed proper procedures.         His performance yesterday made for a remarkable but unredeeming spectacle, fascinating if only on a psychological levelParts of the House gasped with dismay when Mr Cameron noted that Chilcot upbraided Mr Blair for slipshod consultations with the Cabinet. Mr Cameron's speech brought occasional mutterings of dissent from the Scots Nationalist benches – the odd shout of 'nonsense' from Angus MacNeil (Western Isles) after Mr Cameron reported that there had been 'no intention to mislead'. There were elaborate shows of ennui from Alex Salmond (Gordon), who spent much of the time trimming his cuticles and casting sardonic looks to the Chamber's ceiling.There was even more heckling when Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn spoke but the dissent now came from the Labour benches. It was acid. A smartly suited Mr Corbyn called the Iraq war 'an act of military aggression launched on a false pretext'. It had been 'a catastrophe'.               He still, even in this moment of political nakedness, managed to find notes of indignation         Here was Blair the seer, Blair the superior being, Blair the 'decision-maker' who told president Bush 'I will be with you, whatever'         An hour before Mr Blair's extraordinary performance, the Commons had gathered for a David Cameron statement on the Chilcot (pictured) Report         Mr Cameron ran through Blair's contribution with unexpected briskness. He reported that there had been 'no intention to mislead'       Mr Corbyn paid tribute to the families, said it was a pity Chilcot had taken so long to report and argued that 'the tragedy is that while the governing class got it so horrifically wrong, many of our people actually got it right'.'You're a disgrace,' shouted Ian Austin (Dudley N). 'Shut up! Not true!' Mr Austin was not the only Labour man to hurl abuse at his party leader. So did Mike Gapes (Ilford S) and Steve McCabe (Selly Oak), among others. Speaker Bercow eventually told them to desist. This allowed Mr Corbyn a powerful moment.          A smartly suited Mr Corbyn called the Iraq war 'an act of military aggression launched on a false pretext'       He used the sullen silence of the Labour benches to lower his tone and say that 'we have to be saddened at what has been revealed and we must now reflect upon it'. He also invoked the memory of the late Robin Cook.The Blairites had no retort to that. Corbyn had silenced them. This was a powerful speech by the Labour leader. Back in 2003 he called Iraq correctly but he did not crow about that yesterday. He finished the day a great deal more secure in his post.Mark Durkan (SDLP, Foyle) restored some levity to proceedings when, with a jibe at an infamous Blair quotation, he said 'this is not a time for soundbites but the hand of history should be feeling somebody's collar'. The collar of the governing class needs a shake. It got it wrong on Iraq, got it wrong on Europe. The Conservative Party would do well to ponder that disconnect.
