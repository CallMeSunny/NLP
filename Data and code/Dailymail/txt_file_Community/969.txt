China's Xi urges caution over U.S. missile deployment in S.Korea By Reuters   Published: 11:43 BST, 29 June 2016  |  Updated: 11:43 BST, 29 June 2016                e-mail         BEIJING, June 29 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday urged South Korea to pay attention to China's concerns about the deployment of the U.S. THAAD missile defence system to the country and "cautiously" address the plan.The United States and South Korea have begun talks on possible deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system after North Korea tested its fourth nuclear bomb on Jan. 6 and conducted missile tests.China and Russia have urged the United States to back off, saying THAAD's deployment could also affect their security.South Korea should "attach importance to China's legitimate concern on security and cautiously and appropriately address the United States' plan" to deploy THAAD in South Korea, Xi told visiting South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, the official Xinhua news agency reported.North Korea's drive to develop a nuclear weapons capability has angered China, Pyongyang's sole major diplomatic and economic supporter. But Beijing fears THAAD and its radar have a range that would extend into China. (Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Nick Macfie)
