Despite having competing territorial claims in the South China Sea, Duterte has said he prefers to forge closer ties with Beijing. Xinhua quoted Xi as saying the Philippines and China are deepening political mutual trust, carrying out cooperation in various fields, and have set up a channel of dialogue and consultation on the South China Sea. Xi's call came after President Donald Trump called Duterte on Saturday at the close of a summit of Southeast Asian leaders hosted by Duterte, and expressed Washington's commitment to their treaty alliance.
