         Speaker John Bercow (pictured)Speaker John Bercow, who controversially told Reading University students he’d voted Remain, informed scholars at Buckingham University in 1998: ‘The people of Britain will never knowingly consent to be governed by those who do not speak their language, live in their country or depend upon their votes. The power of self-government, the right to hire and fire our rulers and the capacity to chart our own destiny are inalienable birthrights. They should not be traded in for a mess of pottage otherwise known as a back row seat at a show called The Heart Of Europe. Our destiny is surely as a self-governing nation which trades freely with the world. The future is bright; the future is global. Our success in it is dependent upon the vision, self-confidence and calibre of our leaders, our businesses and our workforce.’ My source there adds: ‘His speech was such a Eurosceptic tour de force that the Bruges Group printed it as a pamphlet.’ Fancy!  Former Labour MP Tristram Hunt, 42, makes his debut as director of the Victoria & Albert Museum later this month. He’ll interview, on stage, New Delhi-based Dr Shashi Tharoor, 60, an ex-Indian government minister, who demands that Britain apologise and pay compensation to his country for colonial exploitation. Is Tristram signalling that he’s more virtuous than the Empress of India, Victoria, after whom his cosy new niche is named?  Amanda Wakeley, 54, who designed Theresa May’s leather trousers, enjoys life with her partner, PR adviser Hugh Morrison, confiding: ‘In winter we ski at Verbier and in the summer we sail our yacht off St Tropez… it’s important that I live my clients’ lifestyle to understand their needs.’ Quite so.  Should Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have children they’ll be US citizens – the first American royalty in the House of Windsor since Baltimore divorcee Wallis Simpson. Divorcee Ms Markle threatened to renounce her citizenship in the event of Donald Trump becoming president. She’d have a UK passport as the Duchess of Clarence, the dukedom Harry’s expected to receive.  Ken Loach, 80, whose film I, Daniel Blake won the Outstanding British Film gong at the Baftas, made an hour-long propaganda video to boost Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. This showed supporters ‘heaping praise on the Islington North MP, congratulating him on his principles and thanking him for restoring hope to politics’. That worked out well, didn’t it?

But Baddiel, 52, returning to his father Colin’s dementia for a new Channel 4 documentary, tells Radio Times: ‘I’m perfectly happy if people want to say, “That is not OK,” because maybe it isn’t.’ Maybe not!
