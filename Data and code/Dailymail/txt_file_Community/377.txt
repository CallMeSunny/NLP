 'It's been a very difficult situation for that young girl,' her lawyer Peter Guadagnino told the Post.The court also heard that the 15-year-old was being harassed by fellow inmates at the juvenile facility where she is being held. 'Apparently, she's had some problems,' Guadagnino said. 'She's been harassed about the case, and there have been improper comments. 'The judge appeared to take those threats seriously after they ordered Garcia into protective custody.                 She told police she had carried out the grisly murders with the help of her 28-year-old boyfriend Jerry Maisonett (pictured in court last month) - the father of her unborn child.          The teen, also known as Destiny Sanchez, admits having shot and stabbed Rosie Sanchez, 38, and Anderson Nunez, 40, to death on December 28              Garcia told police she had carried out the grisly murders with the help of her 28-year-old boyfriend Jerry Maisonett - the father of her unborn child       Garcia had initially implicated her godbrother Jordan Santiago in her first statement on January 3 but in her second statement - given the next day - she then removed Santiago and included her boyfriend Jerry Maisonett as the accomplice, said theNew York Daily News.The teen went on to describe how her mother had physically abused her and how she had planned to go and live with a cousin.On the night of the killing, Sanchez apparently caught Garcia with her bags packed and after the pair got into an argument, her mother apparently punched her in the face several times, according to a statement obtained by the newspaper.Following the argument, she then called her boyfriend and asked him for a gun 'for protection', which he is said to have brought to her on the night of the 28th.The 15-year-old then attended New Year's Eve celebrations in Times Square while her mother and step-father's corpses were rotting in the family apartment, investigators say. Maisonett has been indicted for the murders and faces life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted. The account, reported by the New York Daily News, revealed that on that night Sanchez had beaten Garcia, before going back into her bedroom.Garcia then got the gun from a drawer and went into her mother's bedroom and shot at her, which after a second attempt, hit Sanchez in the neck.         In the dramatic accounts, Garcia also told police that her 28-year-old boyfriend Jerry Maisonett was the accomplice. She had initially implicated her godbrother Jordan Santiago         Garcia originally confessed to her cousin Jason Valentin, who subsequently turned her into the police. He told the New York Daily News, that he did not believe her abuse story       Just days after the killings, Gacia apparently partied in Times Square for New Years Eve, while the bodies of Nunez and Sanchez rotted in the family apartment. Pictured: Authorities remove the bodies from the Sheepshead Bay home in Brooklyn       Nunez, who was in the room at the time, then attempted to grab the gun but after Garcia called out for Maisonett, he entered the scene, retrieving the gun and shooting Nunez in the back.After running out of bullets, the pair then stabbed Sanchez and Nunez with a knife Garcia fetched from the kitchen, to make sure both were dead.She confessed to her cousin Jason Valentin on January 3 and Valentin, who then turned her in, said at the time that he did not believe the abuse story, saying that he believed someone had coached her to say it.But grandmother, Jenny Perez said she believed her granddaughter's story and that she had seen Nunez touching her inappropriately. Garcia had initially told investigators that Nunez had sexually abused her and that her mother had turned a blind eye, but while in custody she changed her story, saying that it was her mother who was the abuser. A Facebook page has since been set up in dedication to the dead couple, called RIP 'Rosie Sanchez and Andy Nuñez', where it offers users a space to 'leave heartfelt messages for your dear friends who were lost in this terrible tragedy' but adds: 'no hate on this wall'.  Garcia faces up to 30 years to life in prison for the murders
