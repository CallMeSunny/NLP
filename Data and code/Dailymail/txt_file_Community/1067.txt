Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States in September, it was announced on Wednesday, after the Chinese leader held a telephone conversation with President Barack Obama.The two countries are currently grappling with a host of thorny issues, ranging from Tibet to hacking attacks.The Chinese government said Xi had “accepted Obama’s invitation” for a state visit in September, with both leaders agreeing to “make full preparations” to ensure a successful visit.          China hopes the visit will help resolve its issues with AmericaThe respective readouts of the telephone conversation from Beijing and Washington listed the difficult issues the two countries are hoping to resolve ahead of Xi’s visit. While China reiterated its frustration with American restrictions on high-tech exports and “interference” on Tibet, Obama expressed concerns about reported hacking attacks from China. Xi said both sides should “speed up talks” on a bilateral investment treaty and that the US needed “to loosen restrictions” on high-tech exports, the official Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying. Xi also asked the US to “take seriously” China’s concerns on Tibet, a week after Beijing accused Washington of “interfering” in its “internal affairs” after Obama attended a prayer meeting along with Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama. Obama, for his part, asked China to take “swift” action on cyber-security, the White House said. The US charged five Chinese PLA army officers last year with hacking – a largely symbolic move considering that the officers are in China, but one that triggered an angry reaction with Beijing dissolving a joint working group on cyber-security. The US and China have also been wrestling with tensions over their competing influence in the Asia-Pacific, with the Obama administration in recent months signalling it will push its “rebalancing” with more vigour. Obama’s January 26 visit to New Delhi consequently triggered debate in Beijing, seen by some as an American attempt to enlist India in its efforts.
