The temptation could be there for Steven Gerrard. Turn the key in the ignition, move into reverse gear and park the bus inside the Ljudski vrt Stadium.But that isn't how he wants Rangers to travel through the Europa League. To Gerrard, the stature of the club demands they take on opponents such as Maribor with more weapons than just defensive durability.Two goals to the good after a powerful second-half performance seven days ago, the Ibrox manager knows a third successive away clean sheet in Europe would be enough to finish off the Slovenians.

   He has confidence in his back four to produce again, even with Jon Flanagan's suspension presenting a selection issue at left-back. But equal onus falls upon those in front of them.In his mission to get his squad fully acclimatised to continental competition, Gerrard will demand that Rangers impose themselves on Maribor as they seek a place in the play-off round.'We are not coming here to defend for 90 minutes,' he insisted. 'We are not coming in with the attitude of looking for a draw.'We are coming here to win the game. That's not to say we are going to go crazy, go gung-ho and take all kinds of unnecessary risks.         Gerrard and Rangers Head of Fitness Jordan Milsom help move the goal posts in training'Our game-plan will involve trying to defend with a good, strong performance but carrying a threat, as well.'I don't think when you are the Rangers manager you can go into any game with the attitude of, "We're just going to defend and see if we can scrape through".'We have to carry a mentality that we are a big club and we need to come here and play like a big team.'We've got ambitions of playing in the Europa League and we can't be coming to every away venue and saying: 'Now it's time to defend for 90 minutes, lads'.'As I say, we come here to win the game. We've proven that we have caused this team many problems with our positivity and being ambitious with our forward play.'At certain times in the game, when it allows us, we want to see that positivity again.'It is one of those nights when we are going to have to defend well.'I have confidence and trust in my goalkeeper. As a team, I think we have shown we are capable of coming to places like this and standing firm. But we have to go and prove it again.'We will be tested at certain times. They are a good team with good players who, given time and space, can hurt you.'With Flanagan sidelined by three Europa League bookings and Borna Barisic ineligible until the group stage, Gerrard will have to tweak the back four formula that has worked so well in the early stages of this season.The Liverpool icon was unwilling to confirm his plan last night, but Andy Halliday is favourite to get the left-back nod ahead of Lee Hodson. The midfielder's substitute contribution in Sunday's 2-0 win over St Mirren drew effusive praise from Gerrard about his attitude and application.         Gerrard insists Rangers are too big to park the bus ahead of the Europa League qualifierOptions are more bountiful ahead of an altered defence. Barring any adverse reactions to last night's training session, Gerrard expects Ryan Jack, Lassana Coulibaly and Scott Arfield to all be available in midfield.Their presence will be a significant boost against opponents who have expressed confidence of salvaging a 3-1 deficit. Maribor have hit five in each of their last two domestic outings, with coach Darko Milanic stating earlier this week that his side *will* win against Rangers.'Maribor are a Champions League team,' said Gerrard, referring to their place in last season's group stage.'But we won't be getting nervous or scared because of what's coming out of the Maribor camp.'We come here showing respect, but I believe the team is ready and I believe they are ready to get a result which favours us.'It's very difficult to compare Maribor to domestic teams in Scotland. They carry a similar threat to Osijek. They have got match-winners in their team.'They like to get bodies forward. But at the same time we have noticed that there are areas of their team that we can exploit. As good as they are, we do feel that we will get some opportunities in this game. If we can take them, we will qualify.'We will pick a team with enough talent and enough of a goal threat to go and get an important goal for us.'Jamie Murphy could be crucial to that aim after coming off the bench last week to cross for Coulibaly's bundling finish that gave Rangers their 3-1 advantage.The winger, who also set up Alfredo Morleos for his strike against St Mirren, has contributed a combined total of 20 goals and assists in 25 appearances for the Ibrox outfit.         The Rangers boss addresses his players as they seek to defend a two-goal lead in Slovenia'I didn't know anything about that stat until someone sent me it the other day,' admitted Murphy.'I'm delighted, but the first thing I thought is that it could have been more. That is me just doing my job - setting up goals, scoring goals and being a threat for the team.'I was striker when I was younger so it was all about goals then. It has probably changed as I have got older. Moving into midfield, you get just the same satisfaction from setting one up.'With players like Alfredo Morelos, you know you have someone in the team who can put them away because he is right on form at the moment. I'm pleased to do a bit of both between goals and assists.'Alfredo has worked really hard in pre-season. The staff and all the boys have helped get him to where he is now. If your number nine is scoring every week then it's not a bad thing.'The third goal from the first leg at Ibrox could be big depending on how we do our job over here. If they get an early goal then it is wiped out. We want to protect our lead and score ourselves.'
