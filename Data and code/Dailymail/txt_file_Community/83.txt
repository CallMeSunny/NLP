A state visit between the leaders of the world's two largest economic and military powers may work to strengthen relations between Trump and Xi         Trump and First Lady Melania Trump officially welcomed Xi and his wife and his wife Peng Liyuan at the doors of the Palm Beach, Florida, resort'We have been treated unfairly and have made terrible trade deals with China for many, many years. That's one of the things we are going to be talking about. The other thing of course is going to be North Korea,' Trump said. Trump and Xi are expected to get into more detailed discussions about trade and foreign policy issues on Friday, concluding their summit with a working lunch.Trump promised during the 2016 campaign to stop what he called the theft of American jobs by China and rebuild the country's manufacturing base.The two-day summit brings together two leaders who could not seem more different: the often vocal Trump, prone to angry tweets, and Xi, outwardly calm, measured and tightly scripted, with no known social media presence.What worries the protocol-conscious Chinese more than policy clashes is the risk that the unpredictable Trump could publicly embarrass Xi, after several foreign leaders experienced awkward moments with the new U.S. president.'Ensuring President Xi does not lose face is a top priority for China,' a Chinese official said.

'Nothing involving golf clubs.'The White House has downplayed expectations for a breakthrough on U.S-China issues like trade and tariffs, insisting that the 24-hour summit is mostly an introductory meeting for Trump and Xi.The meeting has been overshadowed somewhat by the US military firing more than 50 tomahawk missiles at the al-Shayrat military airfield in Syria.The massive strike - the first direct US action against President Bashar al-Assad's government and Trump's biggest military decision since taking office - marked a dramatic escalation in American involvement in Syria's six-year civil war. Six people were killed and serious damage caused, according to the Syrian army.  On Friday China warned against 'further deterioration' of the situation in Syria.The country was 'concerned' by the recent events in Syria, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters at a regular press briefing, adding: 'What is urgent now is to avoid further deterioration of the situation.
