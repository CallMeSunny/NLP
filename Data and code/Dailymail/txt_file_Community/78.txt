All Blacks silent on World Cup date with destiny By Afp   Published: 14:55 BST, 14 October 2015  |  Updated: 14:55 BST, 14 October 2015                e-mail         It is the elephant in the All Blacks changing room -- France in the 2007 World Cup quarter-finals at the Millennium Stadium.Some 18,360 kilometres (11,400 miles) from the All Blacks base in Swansea, 4.5 million New Zealanders are praying for "utu", the native Maori word for payback.How France turned a 13-3 deficit at half-time into a 20-18 victory in that quarter-final is etched in the national psyche, yet the All Blacks facing a repeat of enemy, venue and occasion on Saturday don't talk about it.

They are a very unpredictable side, and form and momentum does not count for a lot with the French. They can be poor one week and awesome the following week."If there is any feeling of payback in Saturday's sudden-death encounter, Carter believes it will be with the French looking to make an emphatic statement.Les Bleus would be disappointed with their performances in this tournament, especially the loss to Ireland "and that's a dangerous sign for us," he said."It's one thing I have learned is they love playing the All Blacks in big matches and this weekend is going to be one of those and no matter what's happened in the past this is a separate game and I know the French will perform out of their skins."When the final whistle blew in the French-Ireland pool match, which decided who would play the All Blacks in the quarter-finals, French coach Philippe Saint-Andre immediately claimed underdog status.The French were at their best with their backs against the wall, Saint-Andre said, and he would know.As a player, he sparked the move on full-time that led to the "try from the end of the world" at Eden Park in 1994 when nine players handled the ball in an 80-metre move before Jean-Luc Sadourny scored to win the game for France 23-20.It was the try that gave rise to the term "French flair" and All Blacks fullback Ben Smith believed that naming New Zealand as favourites was the unpredictable Saint-Andre at his counter-attacking best."I think the French team will have a lot of belief in themselves. I think they've been playing some great rugby so I wouldn't say they're huge underdogs," said Smith."If that was us and we were in that situation we would have a lot of trust in what we're doing."Whenever we do get an opportunity we really have to nail it. We've got to unleash or we will be going home."
