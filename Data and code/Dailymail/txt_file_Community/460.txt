They should have been careful what they wished for. For months, the Kamikaze Brexiteers have been ordering Theresa May to be strong. Show some Thatcherite steel, they demanded. Stand up for Britain. If anyone attempts to get in your way – and sabotage Brexit – crush them.So she did. To borrow a well-worn phrase, the Prime Minister took back control. Of her Cabinet. Of her Government. Of the negotiations that will define the destiny of the United Kingdom for a generation.         Prime Minister Theresa May speaks during a cabinet meeting at Chequers, the Prime Minister's official country residence near Ellesborough British politics – indeed all politics – is in unprecedented ferment. But a new iron law has now asserted itself. Dismiss Mrs May at your peril. As some of her colleagues have just found to their cost.It's worth remembering where we were at the start of last week.Mrs May was heading down to Chequers and into an ambush. Her preferred Brexit plan had been declared 'dead on arrival'. Jacob Rees-Mogg's shock troops were poised to submit the names to launch a leadership challenge. Ministerial resignations would provide the trigger.Instead, it was the Prime Minister who produced the ambush. And she did so with the weapons she always deploys to greatest effect. Patience, pragmatism and facts.                The Prime Minister took back control. Of her Cabinet. Of her Government. Of the negotiations that will define the destiny of the United Kingdom for a generation All sorts of nuanced arguments are being put forward from the Brexiteers about why they chose to row in behind her proposal for a pragmatic 'soft' Brexit – a concept Mrs May herself refuses to recognise. They are accompanied by much sulking and threats of retribution to come.But the real reason they acquiesced is simple. They had to. Because they had no answer to the three inconvenient truths she presented them with in the Chequers Grand Parlour.The first is there is no parliamentary majority for a hard Brexit. To pursue one, the Conservatives would have to knife Mrs May, shoe-horn in a new leader, circumvent the Fixed Term Parliament Act and drag an austerity-exhausted British public back to the polls – telling them it's to give the Government the right to impose poorer working conditions, lower environmental standards and import Donald Trump's chlorinated chicken – all the while praying we have reached peak Corbyn. Unsurprisingly, even the most ardent Cabinet Brexiteers recognised the wrinkle in this master-plan.         Members of the cabinet gather at Chequers, the Prime Minister's official country residence for today's crunch Brexit talks, which are running into tonightThe second is that there is no way to circumvent the Irish border issue. The Prime Minister is clear there are two areas where she will not countenance concessions – the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement and the sanctity of the Union.The Brexiteers have placed a reassertion of sovereignty at the heart of their demands. But they cannot extend that sovereignty into the Republic of Ireland. Avoidance of a hard border is not in the UK's gift – it can only be the product of negotiation, agreement and, the dreaded 'C' word: compromise.The third was less a fact, more a Hobson's choice. Mrs May could indeed have turned her back on access to the EU market for goods and embraced a 'no-deal Brexit'. This would, her own Government's forecasts indicated, have produced a 16 per cent negative growth hammer blow to GDP, with concurrent impact on jobs, tax receipts, public services and scope for tax cuts.Or she could avoid that hammer blow by agreeing a limited harmonisation and frictionless access. As one Downing Street official put it: 'When the British people voted for Brexit they did so because they wanted to take back governance of their laws, borders and institutions. Not because they wanted to argue about the size of widgets.'         A supporter of the Foreign Secretary, when asked why he hadn't resigned, claimed 'Boris is of more use to the country inside the Cabinet because it will enable him to stop a soft Brexit getting any softer'Yesterday morning, the Kamikaze Brexiteers were attempting to portray Chequers as a second Potsdam. The word 'betrayal' hangs in the air. But this wasn't the moment the Brexiteers were betrayed. It was the moment they ran headlong into reality. The implementation period of Brexit was always going to be a tortuous affair. The refrain of 'why don't we just leave' sits easily on the lips of bar-room philosophers like Danny Dyer. But it has no place among serious politicians charged with serious national business.

Share this article Share   People demanded leadership and the Prime Minister has provided it. So now the focus shifts to others and whether they are prepared to meet their own obligations.First in line are the Cabinet. Even before they arrived at Chequers, the recriminations – especially amongst Brexiteers – were beginning. Liam Fox was described to me as a 'complete weasel' by one former ally. Michael Gove was 'missing in action'. Boris 'all ego, no trousers'. David Davis 'lost in the weeds'.Such infighting will delight arch-Remainers. But it should not delight anyone else. Each senior Cabinet Brexiteer is prone to the vanities and jealousies that afflict all members of the political class.          Jacob Rees-Mogg is not PM. He is not a member of the Government. He has a mandate to speak for no one save his 70,000 constituentsBut collectively they are honourable men who believe in their Brexit ideal. And having dipped their hands in the Chequers blood, they must pull themselves together, help Mrs May pull her party together and fight for the deal she has produced.Then there are the Remainers themselves. They claim their goal is a pragmatic Brexit. Well, they have their wish. So we shall now be able to see whether they too are honourable, or whether their objective was to undermine the popular will all along.Which brings us to a certain Mr Jacob Rees-Mogg. Yesterday, some Cabinet Brexiteers were casting a wistful eye in his direction. 'Theresa won't be able to get this past Jacob,' one said. Sorry, but Jacob needs to get back in his box.Last month, when it looked like Tory Remain MPs would use parliamentary process to undermined Mrs May's negotiating stance, Mr Rees-Mogg toured the broadcast studios in a state of high constitutional dudgeon, arguing ferociously it was not for MPs to bind the executive's hands. 'The Government's job is to get on with the details, legislations and planning,' he said.It was true then and it is true now. Mr Rees-Mogg is not PM. He is not a member of the Government. He has a mandate to speak for no one save his 70,000 constituents.          But the real reason they acquiesced is simple. They had to. Because they had no answer to the three inconvenient truths she presented them with in the Chequers Grand Parlour So it is fair to expect him to stick to his principles and give Mrs May the time and space to 'get on with the details'.There is another group who need to give Mrs May time and space. The members of the EU. A popular narrative on Friday evening was that Europe would summarily reject her proposal. But Downing Street officials placed great stress on her meeting with Angela Merkel and Dutch PM Mark Rutte to brief them. There was little point in it if they planned a swift rejection.Nor should there be one. Mrs May has taken a huge personal political risk in going the extra mile for an amicable Brexit. And it is imperative our former partners now respond in kind.People have been demanding leadership from the Prime Minister. On Friday she demonstrated it – in spades. The question now is, do her Cabinet, her party and our European allies have the strength and stature to follow her?
