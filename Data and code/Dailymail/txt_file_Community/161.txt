India Today magazine in its latest issue reveals that the on-going stand-off between India and China at the Doklam plateau was triggered by a Chinese manoeuvre on the night of June 8 - barely hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping the following day in Astana, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit.On the night of June 8, a platoon of China's Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) is alleged by the magazine to have stealthily moved into the plateau and razed stone bunkers that the Royal Bhutan Army (RBA) had constructed years ago and manned occasionally.In doing so, China seems to have made a pre-meditated move to alter the status quo that prevailed for decades in the sensitive Doklam plateau that abuts the India-China-Bhutan trijunction, and is contested by China and Bhutan.         : Chinese President Xi Jinping (right) shakes hands with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi         Chinese President Xi Jinping walks past Russian honour guardsChina's manoeuvre unfolded the day before the Modi-Xi meet at Astana, which was surprisingly cordial. As Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar said after the June 9 meeting, 'There was an understanding that where we have differences, it is important that differences should not become dispute.'Yet China undertook its manoeuver in Doklam barely hours before. This is not the first time that the PLA's actions have contradicted the seemingly reassuring words of its leader Xi, who heads the powerful Central Military Commission.In September 2014, as Modi hosted Xi in Gujarat and the two leaders were photographed on a jhula and doing a diplomatic tango, the PLA violated the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Chumar and Demchok in Ladakh in the western sector.
