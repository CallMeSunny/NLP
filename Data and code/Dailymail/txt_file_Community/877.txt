It was an honor to meet President Xi and other leaders.’But he wasn’t the only one to have his request denied at the White House state dinner, although others mainly asked for business-related favors.An impressive line-up of diplomats and Hollywood stars made up Obama's 200-person guest list for the extravagant feast at the White House.As well as top-level politicians from both countries, other guests at the black-tie dinner included Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft’s chief executive Satya Nadella.Others in attendance included former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger, 92, and Madeleine Albright, 78.DailyMail.com has contacted a representative of Zuckerberg for comment.
