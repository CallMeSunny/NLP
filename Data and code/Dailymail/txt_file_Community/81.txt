 The Dalai Lama's personal spokesman Tenzin Taklha said he didn't have any comments to make, without either confirming or denying the contents in the book.The Dalai Lama set up a government-in-exile in Dharamsala in northern India and launched a campaign to reclaim Tibet from China, which gradually evolved into an appeal for greater autonomy - the so-called 'middle way' approach.         In her book 'Defining India - Through Their Eyes', Sonia Singh claims that India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government was concerned about maintaining good relations with China. Modi (left) and Chinese PresidentÂ Xi Jinping are pictured together at the G20 Summit in 2016India, which gave him asylum in 1959, has supported the Tibetan leader but of late the government has maintained a distance, citing diplomatic sensitivities.Singh, the editorial director of NDTV news channel, says the meeting had the 'promise to change the course of China-Tibet relations' if it had been allowed to happen.The Dalai Lama is also quoted as saying he had 'very good relations' with Modi, who is seeking a second term in the ongoing general election.'He is quite an active Indian prime minister, continuously visiting many countries. That, I admire at his age.'A global symbol of peace, the Dalai Lama was briefly hospitalised for a chest infection in Delhi last month.The book is set to be released on May 20.
