              Supporters of far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, celebrate in front of the National Congress in Brasilia, after the former army captain won Brazil's presidential electionAn outspoken admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, Bolsonaro also pledged to realign Brazil with more advanced economies rather than regional allies, overhauling diplomatic priorities after nearly a decade and a half of leftist rule.  Trump called Bolsonaro to wish him well after his victory, forging closer bonds between the two largest nations in the Americas both now led by conservative populists promising to overturn the political establishment.Celebrations from last night continued into this morning outside his home in Rio de Janeiro's Barra da Tijuca neighborhood.A former army captain, Bolsonaro is vowing to rescue the country from crisis with a firm grip.He tapped into deep anti-establishment anger throughout the election campaign, but repulsed many with his denigrating remarks about women, gay and black people. Bolsonaro's rise has been propelled by a rejection of the leftist PT that ran Brazil for 13 of the last 15 years before being ousted two years ago in the midst of a deep recession and political graft scandal.Reacting to his victory in a video transmitted from his home in Rio de Janeiro, the new President recounted how he was stabbed while campaigning last month and almost died.  Bolsonaro, who ran on promises to clean up Brazil and bring back 'traditional values,' said he would respect the constitution and personal liberty.Bolsonaro also vowed to defend 'constitution, democracy and freedom' in Brazil.         Supporters of Jair Bolsonaro hold a cardboard gun in Rio de Janeiro as they celebrate after Bolsonaro wins the Brazilian presidential race         Supporters gather outside the residence of president-elect Bolsonaro in anticipation of his victory speech, in Rio de Janeiro         Bolsonaro's supporters were in high spirits after his victory and could be seen celebrating by waving flags and gathering together in joyHe said:  'I first want to thank God. This is not the promise of a party, nor the word of a man. It is an oath before God. 'We will change Brazil's destiny together.'  Bolsonaro will take office on January 1. The longtime congressman pledged to govern following the Bible and the constitution and added: 'We cannot continue flirting with socialism, communism, populism and the extremism of the left.' Mr Bolsonaro has vowed to crack down on crime in Brazil's cities and farm belt by granting police more autonomy to shoot at criminals.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Brazil's 'Tropical Trump' looks set to be voted in as...

          Supporters of far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, celebrate in front of his house in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, after he won Brazil's presidential election         Bolsonaro's supporters were in high spirits after voting ended on Sunday - and later set off fireworks as celebrations took place in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paolo         Bolsonaro has only campaigned on Twitter since an attacker stabbed him in the stomach at a rally, sending him to the hospital for three weeks. Pictured, Bolsonaro after the attack         A far-right former army captain, Bolsonaro is vowing to rescue the country from crisis with a firm grip - although he has been criticised for some of his comments          Brazil's new president defeated leftist Fernando Haddad (pictured), a former Sao Paulo mayor, in the election. Here he is pictured at a polling station in Sao Paulo         A supporter of Brazilian far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro celebrates his victory at the Ministries Esplanade, in Brasilia while posing with a nerf gun         His supporters took to the streets of Rio de Janeiro to celebrate Bolsonaro's election success         Supporters of Jair Bolsonaro, far-right lawmaker and presidential candidate of the Social Liberal Party (PSL), gather around an inflatable doll, also known as Pixuleco, depicting Brazil's former President Luiz Inacio Lula da SilvaOn the losing side, the reaction was despair - and a defiant vow to resist. The defeated Haddad vowed to 'defend freedoms' of the president-elect's opponents and the 45 million people who voted for him.   Aides also said that Mr Haddad had not called Bolsonaro to congratulate him.'This is a dark day for Brazil; Brazilian democracy is now in complete crisis,' said Mark Weisbrot of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.Laura Chinchilla, the former president of Costa Rica and head of the Organization of American States' Electoral Observation Mission, said the vote had been calm and orderly across the country, which has suffered a spate of partisan violence during the campaign.As the results came in, supporters flooded the streets outside Bolsonaro's home in Rio de Janeiro, letting off fireworks and waving Brazilian flags.People also set off fireworks on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach, and car drivers honked their horns across the city.          Fernando Haddad, presidential candidate of Brazil's leftist Workers Party, vowed to defend the freedoms of Bolsonaro's opponents after his defeat         Haddad kisses his wife Ana Estela in Sao Paulo after his press conference following the result of the election         Supporters of Jair Bolsonaro celebrate in front of his residence in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil after the results of the election were announced         They could be seen letting off fireworks and shooting flares as they celebrated Bolsonaro's victory over Haddad         Supporters flooded the streets outside Bolsonaro's home in Rio de Janeiro, letting off fireworks and waving Brazilian flags         Supporters of Brazilian far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro celebrate his victory over his leftist in Rio de Janeiro         Supporters of Bolsonaro looked ready to party well into the night as they celebrated the former soldier's victory in the Brazil elections         Flags were waved and fireworks and flare were let off all over Brazil as Bolsonaro's supporters celebrated his election victory         As well as setting off fireworks, his supporters blared car horns throughout Rio after Bolsonaro was declared the victor         A supporter of Jair Bolsonaro draped in the Brazilian flag celebrates in Sao Paolo after Bolsonaro wins the presidential raceIn Sao Paulo, crowds gathered on a central avenue with banners and flags and people cheered and set off firecrackers in other neighborhoods as results came in.Riot police separated supporters of Bolsonaro and those of Fernando Haddad when they briefly scuffled in Sao Paulo.After the result, supporters of the leftist Worker Party (PT) and Brazil's former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva gathered outside the Federal Police headquarters where Lula is serving a prison sentence, in Curitiba. Many Brazilians are concerned that Bolsonaro, an admirer of Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship and a defender of its use of torture on leftist opponents, will trample on human rights, curtail civil liberties and muzzle freedom of speech.The 63-year-old seven-term congressman has vowed to crack down on crime in Brazil's cities and farm belt by granting police more autonomy to shoot at criminals.          Police officers patrol the streets during a gathering of supporters of the left-wing presidential candidate for the Workers Party (PT), Fernando Haddad, in Rio de Janeiro         Supporters of Fernando Haddad, presidential candidate of Brazil's leftist Workers Party (PT), and Jair Bolsonaro, far-right lawmaker and presidential candidate of the Social Liberal Party (PSL), face off after the election results         Tensions were high between the two groups after the results - although there were no reports of widespread and serious violence following Bolsonaro's win         There were reports of brief scuffles in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo between supporters of Bolsonaro and Haddad         Supporters of Socialist candidate Fernando Haddad argue with supporters of far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro after the results of the elections, in Rio de Janeiro         Serious fights and violence didn't break out but it seemed as if tensions were running high between rival groups all over the country         Supporters of Bolsonaro could be seen taking to the streets and celebrating just before the results were announced         Supporters of Fernando Haddad, presidential candidate of Brazil's leftist Workers Party (PT), react to exit polls during a runoff election in Rio de Janeiro         As the results came in, Bolsonaro's supporters set off fireworks on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach, and car drivers honked their horns across the cityHe also wants to let more Brazilians buy weapons to fight crime.Bolsonaro - who is nicknamed 'Tropical Trump' - made a final pitch on social media ahead of the election, the only place he has campaigned since an attacker stabbed him in the stomach at a rally last month, sending him to the hospital for three weeks.'God willing, tomorrow will be our new independence day,' he tweeted.In an unusual move, the Chief Justice of the Brazilian Supreme Court, Jose Dias Toffoli, read out part of the country's constitution to reporters after he voted yesterday. Many took it to be a rebuke of Mr Bolsonaro and his more extreme positions.He said: 'The future president must respect institutions, must respect democracy, the rule of law, the judiciary branch, the national Congress and the legislative branch.'Coming on the heels of a punishing recession and staggering corruption scandal, the Latin American giant's elections have thrown up a spectacular cast of characters, even by the standards of these divisive, anti-establishment times.

He frequently disparaged women, gays and blacks, and said he would name military men to his Cabinet.Minutes after he was elected, several international human rights groups also put out statements demanding that Bolsonaro respect Brazil's democracy.Some of the most controversial comments made by the newly-elected president include:During 2016 impeachment proceedings against former leftist President Dilma Rousseff, who was jailed and tortured during Brazil's military dictatorship in the 1970s, Bolsonaro dedicated his vote to the colonel who tortured her.In 2003, Bolsonaro pushed a congresswoman and told her: 'I would never rape you because you do not deserve it.' He repeated the comment in 2014 in the chamber.On a radio program in 2016, Bolsonaro said the error of the dictatorship had been 'to torture and not to kill.' Brazil's national truth commission found that 440 people died under the 1964-85 military rule, of which 210 disappeared without trace.Brazil's public prosecutor charged Bolsonaro earlier this year with inciting discrimination against black people, indigenous people, women and gays in public comments he has made, including 'If I see two men kissing in the street, I will hit them.'At an event last year in Rio de Janeiro, he said having a daughter, his fifth child after four boys, was a 'weakness.''I would not be able to love a gay son. I would rather he die in an accident,' he told Playboy magazine in 2011.Speaking last year about communities of descendants of escaped slaves, who are protected by Brazil's social programs, Bolsonaro suggested the state was wasting money: 'They do nothing! I don't think they even serve for reproduction.'           The reaction of Haddad's supporters was markedly different and some of them looked inconsolable after the result         A supporter of Haddad embraces a fellow weeping supporter after learning that rival Jair Bolsonaro was declared the winner in the presidential runoff election         Supporters of the leftist Worker Party (PT) and Brazil's former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva gathered outside the Federal Police headquarters where Lula is serving a prison sentence, in CuritibaBolsonaro repulses a large part of the electorate - and many outside the country - with his overtly misogynistic, homophobic and racist rhetoric.He once told a lawmaker he opposed that she 'wasn't worth raping;' he has said he would rather see his sons die than come out as gay; and he commented after visiting one black community that they 'do nothing - they're so useless I doubt they can procreate.'But an even larger portion of voters rejected Haddad and the tarnished legacy of his Workers' Party.  Haddad, 55, stood as a surrogate for jailed ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who led Brazil through the boom years of 2003 to 2010.Lula remains the country's most popular politician, despite being accused of masterminding the massive pilfering of state oil company Petrobras. But the hugely divisive Workers' Party founder was barred from running because he is serving a 12-year prison sentence.

Bolsonaro (right) had an eight- to 10-point lead over leftist Fernando Haddad (left) going in, according to two final opinion polls released on Saturday         'This thing is going to turn around,' Haddad, a former Sao Paulo mayor, buoyantly told thousands of supporters at his final campaign rally Saturday (pictured)Bolsonaro harks back to a different past: that of the 'Brazilian miracle' of rapid industrialisation under the military regime that ruled from 1964 to 1985.He has drawn criticism for his vocal defense of the brutal dictatorship.He once said the regime's 'mistake' was that it tortured, instead of killing, leftist dissidents and suspected sympathisers.But in an anti-establishment climate, his message has sold better than Haddad's.The election looks set to be decided as much by Brazilians voting against something as for it.One poll released Saturday found 39 percent of voters said they would not cast a ballot for Bolsonaro under any circumstances.The rejection rate for Haddad was even higher: 44 percent.

     Running for the formerly minor Social Liberal Party, Bolsonaro is, according to many political analysts, a symptom of the crises ailing Brazil since the Workers Party's 13 years in power came crashing to an end with the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff in 2016.Among those crises: Brazil's economy shrank nearly seven percent during its worst-ever recession, from 2015 to 2016; the multi-billion-dollar Petrobras scandal has left voters disgusted with the seemingly bottomless corruption of politicians and business executives; and there is widespread outrage over violent crime, in a country that registered a record 63,880 murders last year.Outgoing President Michel Temer, himself implicated in corruption, is set to leave office on January 1 as the most unpopular president in Brazil's modern democracy with a two per cent approval rating.  What can Brazilians expect from their new president Jair Bolsonaro? Jair Bolsonaro promised in his victory speech Sunday to 'change Brazil's destiny,' after campaigning on a controversial and hardline law-and-order platform.The former army captain, 63, campaigned under the slogan 'Brazil above all, God above everyone.'Here are some of his key policy proposals and ideas:Economy:Reduce public debt by 20 percent through a raft of privatizations and the sale of state properties.Create a parallel private pension system.Reduce the number of ministries: 'The country will work better with fewer ministries.' His chief economic advisor, respected liberal economist Paulo Guedes, will lead an Economy super-ministry with responsibility for finance, planning and trade.Redistribute the 'tax burden so that those who pay a lot pay less and those who evade and hide pay more.'Security:Loosen gun laws. 'Guns are tools that can be used to kill or to save lives. It depends who's using them.'Lower the age of criminal responsibility to 16.Classify squatting on or seizing private real estate as 'terrorism.'Corruption:'We want a decent, different government from all those that have plunged us into an ethical, moral and budgetary crisis.' Diplomacy:'We are going to stop hailing murderous dictatorships' - said in reference to Venezuela - 'and denigrating great democracies like the United States, Italy and Israel.'Education:'School programs and teaching methods need to change. There needs to be more mathematics, more sciences and Portuguese. Without indoctrination or early sexualization.'Abortion:His platform doesn't mention it, but he has promised to veto any move to ease Brazil's restrictive abortion laws. In the country, terminating pregnancies is permitted only in cases of rape, where the mother's health is in danger, or severe brain malformation in the fetus.LGBTI:His program makes no mention of LGBTI (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersexual) rights. Several of his statements were openly homophobic.During the campaign he tried to soften his tone. In his final campaign speech on Facebook, he said: 'We went a free Brazil, without prejudice: white or black, homo or hetero.... Who knows, maybe I'm gay. If I were, what would be the problem?'Environment:Reflecting his backing from the powerful agro-industry lobby in Congress, Bolsonaro plans to merge the Agriculture and Environment ministries, and his manifesto makes no mention of deforestation or global warming.'Let's be clear: the future ministry will come from the productive sector,' he said recently.
