         Blow: As the unelected European Commission tears up EU migration rules, David Cameron’s bid to renegotiate our terms of membership lies in tatters As the unelected European Commission tears up EU migration rules, David Cameron’s bid to renegotiate our terms of membership lies in tatters.True, his manifesto aim of cutting net arrivals from the current 336,000 a year to fewer than 100,000 was never convincing.But the eurocrats’ move to coerce us into accepting a quota of perhaps 90,000 asylum seekers a year from the Middle East and Africa, while continuing to offer open access to EU citizens, makes a complete mockery of his hopes.It also exposes the futility of his negotiating stance, under which he seeks to discourage mass immigration merely by restricting EU nationals’ access to British benefits. A fat lot of difference such tinkering will make, given the scale of the demographic tsunami facing us.Indeed, the message has gone out loud and clear from the Commission: ‘We in Brussels, not the British Parliament or people, will decide who may settle in the UK – and if you refuse to cooperate, we will withdraw your right to send migrants back to their point of entry to the EU.’This is disgracefully unjust, since Mr Cameron has displayed far more wisdom on the refugee crisis than those seeking to impose their will on Britain.It was his humane plan only to welcome families (not young single men) chosen from refugee camps on Syria’s borders. Thus, he hoped to deter asylum seekers from risking the lethal sea crossing to Greece and Italy.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 2 Next       DAILY MAIL COMMENT: Show some steel and save a vital...

In a rare and perhaps politically fatal lapse of judgment, she threw open Germany’s borders to all.The results have been as calamitous as they were predictable: a tidal wave of migrants, mostly men of working age, sweeping across Europe in quest of better lives. Among them, of course, are some who have brought with them religious animosities (not to mention a lascivious contempt for Western women).No wonder Italy and Greece have been unable to cope, defying the rules in an act of self-preservation by waving migrants through without vetting.Too late, after the mass sex attacks in Germany on New Year’s Eve, Mrs Merkel has realised her blunder.         More than 12,000 people have been sent to other EU countries from Britain since 2003. Pictured: Migrants from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan walk this week in very cold weather, through snow in Macedonia to a campYet instead of strengthening border controls on Europe’s furthest shores, she is conspiring with the Commission to make all EU countries take a share of the new arrivals, according to population size and jobless rates.Which brings us to the most bitter irony of all. As yesterday’s hugely encouraging jobs figures show (and much credit to George Osborne) this country is doing extraordinarily well. But this, in turn, makes us more attractive to migrants willing to work for low wages.Indeed, the steady rise in real pay is stalling, while youth unemployment remains disturbingly high at 13.7 per cent, as settlers take the starter jobs.Little surprise, then, that resentment is growing – as shown by the abuse endured by migrants in Middlesbrough, who have been crassly allocated homes easily identified by their red doors.Even the IMF warned on Tuesday, that mass migration is putting social cohesion under tremendous strain.Yet this is the context in which the eurocrats seek to blackmail us into accepting tens of thousands more migrants, against voters’ express wishes.As Daniel Hannan drily observes on this page: ‘If this is how they treat us now, before our referendum, imagine how they’d treat us if we voted to stay.’Isn’t it looking increasingly as if we can kiss goodbye to any pretence of controlling our national destiny while we remain in the Brussels club?
