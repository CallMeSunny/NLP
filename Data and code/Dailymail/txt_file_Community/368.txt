 While Germany and Europe would strive to remain on good terms with America and Britain, 'we have to fight for our own destiny', Merkel went on.Special emphasis was needed on warm relations between Berlin and newly-elected French President Emmanuel Macron, she said.         Mrs Merkel, left, expressed concern over Donald Trump's effort to scrap Paris climate deal The chancellor had just returned from a G7 summit which wound up Saturday without a deal between the US and the other six major advanced nations on upholding the 2015 Paris climate accords.Merkel on Saturday labelled the result of the 'six against one' discussion 'very difficult, not to say very unsatisfactory'.Theresa May had left the summit in Taormina at the end of the first day on Friday in order to return to the UK to chair a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency committee on the Manchester bomb attack. Trump offered a more positive assessment on Twitter Sunday, writing: 'Just returned from Europe. Trip was a great success for America. Hard work but big results!'The US president had earlier tweeted that he would reveal whether or not the US would stick to the global emissions deal - which he pledged to jettison on the campaign trail - only next week.On a previous leg of his first trip abroad as president, Trump had repeated past criticism of NATO allies for failing to meet the defensive alliance's military spending commitment of two percent of GDP.         Mrs Merkel, pictured talking to IMF chief Chirstine Lagarde and the French President Emmanuel Macron who was attending his first ever G7 event which was held in Sicilly         Donald Trump was heavily critical of Germany's economic policy towards the United StatesObservers noted that he neglected to publicly endorse the pact's Article Five, which guarantees that member countries will aid the others they are attacked.The omission was especially striking as he unveiled a memorial to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the US, the only time the mutual defence clause has been triggered.Trump also reportedly described German trade practices as 'bad, very bad,' in Brussels talks last week, complaining that Europe's largest economy sells too many cars to the US.Sunday's event saw Merkel renew bonds with the Christian Social Union (CSU), Bavarian sister party to her own centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), ahead of a parliamentary vote in September.Polls show the chancellor, in power since 2005, on course to be re-elected for a fourth term.
