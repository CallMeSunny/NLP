Lion of Panjshir's son ready to take up his Afghan destiny By Afp   Published: 14:13 BST, 1 September 2016  |  Updated: 14:14 BST, 1 September 2016                e-mail         His first public appearance was at the tender age of 12, a tiny figure walking, head down in grief, beside his legendary father's coffin.Fifteen years later, Ahmad Massoud, son of Ahmad Shah Massoud -- the charismatic, French-speaking mujahedeen commander who held the Soviets at bay and was Afghanistan's last bulwark against the Taliban -- is ready to step into the spotlight once more.When he arrives unannounced at his father's tomb in an immaculate white shalwar kameez, it is as though he were an apparition: a woman in a burqa falls to her knees and wails, while an elderly man in a faded turban wipes his eyes.

The child walked with his head down, his hands clasped behind his back, as his father had done. His clear voice moved mourners to tears as he echoed Massoud's call for independence.It was not until years later that he understood the true burden of his inheritance."I was in love with astronomy," he told AFP. "I was full of energy, I was on fire."But one of his father's friends told him: "We expect you to work on a solution for the Afghan people, and I don't think you will find it on another planet."His passion doused, he made instead for London, King's College to study international relations. Now 27, Ahmad is set to complete his schooling and return home.It was all for Afghanistan, he says."I studied to come back. I have no dual nationalities, I have no property outside Afghanistan, I have nothing... I am completely devoted."Afghanistan in 2016 remains insecure. "This government has kept none of its promises," Ahmad says.Facing a resurgent Taliban, Washington renewed its military commitments to Kabul in June, and Ahmad expressed his gratitude for international support even as he remained critical of US policies."With the campaign of Iraq, they completely overlooked Afghanistan and they allowed a false shepherd ... to be in charge," he says, resulting in the mess of today.He refused to name names. But the criticism appeared to target both current president Ashraf Ghani -- who shares power in a fragile agreement negotiated by the US with Massoud's ally, Abdullah Abdullah -- and Ghani's predecessor, Hamid Karzai.- 'They hijacked Islam' -Much of the pathos surrounding Ahmad Shah Massoud includes speculation about how Afghanistan would look today had he lived."He did not want anyone to intervene in Afghanistan," Ahmad says.His father warned the world about bin Laden, he says, referring to a speech Massoud made to the European Parliament in the spring of 2001 calling for support for Afghanistan "to stand against this".But the world did not listen, Ahmed says, and after 9/11 it was too late.Fifteen years have passed, with billions of dollars spent, and thousands killed. Ahmad brands it all a "waste"."They killed my father in the name of Islam... They did not care that my father was a Muslim," he says."They... just hijacked Islam -- they do not believe or understand Islam. And I can strongly say, they are not Muslim. They are simply terrorists."So does he see himself taking up a political role on the national stage -- MP, minister, president -- as did his warrior father, who was defence minister after driving the Soviets out?"Why not," he says -- if it is the will of the people. If not, "I become a teacher."At his father's tomb, perched above the valley near rusting Soviet tanks, Ahmad greets the children of admirers and poses for selfies.How does he describe the response? "Love," he says.
