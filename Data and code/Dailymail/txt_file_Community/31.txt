"When we speak about Crimea ... we realise that it is our history, our destiny and our pain too ... and that there is a great number of our people (living there), who have voted this year to return to the Russian Federation."Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine earlier this year, sparking the worst East-West crisis in decades and triggering Western sanctions, ranging from asset freezes to visa bans.
