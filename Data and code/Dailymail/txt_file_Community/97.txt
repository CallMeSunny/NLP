A mother of four has written a revealing essay about how she believes she would be happier if she'd never had children.Salt Lake City-based content editor Brooke Lark wrote a piece for YourTango in which she explains that as a youngster growing up as a devout Mormon, she believed that becoming a mother was her 'divine destiny'. But after raising four children into their teens, she describes sitting down at her computer and typing into Google: 'I wish I'd never had kids'.'I wasn't as much admitting to the ether that I regretted my life. No. I was asking Google to help me find other mothers who felt the same way,' she wrote. 'Hoping against hope that some other mother woke up in her mid-30s, realized her reality, and shared those shameful feelings: I wish I'd never had children.'          Regret: Brooke Lark, a formerly devout Morman living in Salt Lake City has penned a revealing essay about how she believes she would be happier if she'd never had her four children         From the start: Married and a mother at a young age, Brooke thought that having children and staying home was her 'divine destiny'In her essay, the Colorado native describes how she once saw an article by advice columnist Ann Landers that had been published the year before she was born, and asked parents: 'If you had it to do over again, would you have children?'The results of the survey - written into the publication on postcards by over 10,000 parents - found that 70 per cent of respondents said that having kids wasn't worth it.  'Making it work' wasn't what I expected motherhood to be  Spotting the article 23 years after it had been published and already a mother-of-two with twins on the way, Brooke reacted angrily to the stat, writing her own reply branding the respondents as 'selfish'.But 12 years later, it seemed that she was in a very different frame of mind as she sat down at her computer.  'Google has long been my crystal ball. I've consulted it before in times of distress,' she wrote, adding that previous searches of her included: 'Do I have melanoma?' 'Do I have Ahlzehiemers?' and 'Should I divorce my husband?'But this time around she was disappointed to find that very few other moms were expressing the similar sentiments online.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Woman who lost her two-year-old daughter to cancer vows to...

          Spreading the word: Brooke was opening up about her feelings because she believes that, 'it's time for moms to talk honestly about the reality of parenting'         Having a look: Brooke claims that when she typed the words 'I wish I'd never had kids' into Google, she was looking for other mothers that felt the sameBrooke does, however, admit that the regrets she feels do have a lot to do with her previous beliefs. As a 'recovering religionist', she said she had spent years being a housewife and carer before finding herself divorced, poorly educated and needed to fend for four children.While she has been lucky in that she found a way to work from home and is 'somehow making it work,' she wrote: '"making it work" wasn't what I expected motherhood to be'.'I thought I'd be better,' she explains. 'I thought I'd be a party-throwing mom. I thought I'd be pretty and kind and Pinterest-y. I thought I'd find myself and fulfillment in my marriage and kids, as so many people had promised. I long for the simplicity of focusing on one thing: me 'Instead, here I am in the smack-dab middle of motherhood and I feel lost. I feel time-sucked and threadworn. I feel like I'm responsible for carrying the world. And on so many days, I long for the simplicity of focusing on just one thing: me.'I feel like I'm responsible for carrying the world. And on so many days, I long for the simplicity of focusing on just one thing: me. That sentence sounds selfish, but I'm guessing there are a million moms who understand.'She added: 'It's time for moms to talk honestly about the reality of parenting,'          Moving on: Brooke also said that resenting her past decisions just made her angry so she vowed to, 'embrace the heaviness, and enjoy the adventures my children's lives bring into [my life]'However, she said, she feels that it is more the current state of motherhood that she is struggling with, calling it a 'veritable meritocracy' and a 'balancing act' that 'tears at your soul' and 'wears you out'.Mostly, however, Brooke claims she is mostly mourning her 'loss of choice', how she lost her freedom to a decision she made when she was very young.But at the end of her article, she added that she accepts responsibility for that decision, and deals with the idea that she will 'never know' if it would have been 'more fun to find myself on a 9-month escape to a Tibetan Monastery'.'Wishing I could go back only makes me frustrated and stuck feeling and angry and resentful,' she said. 'And so, I embrace Life As It Is. I take all the chaos and wonder and wildness that is my Real Life. I let go of heartache, embrace the heaviness, and enjoy the adventures my children's lives bring into mine. While many readers have come out and praised Brooke for her honesty on a topic not often talked about, other readers of the article were less impressed, with several saying that they hope Brooke's children never spot the article.
