Theresa May holds a state meeting with Xi JinpingMrs May gave the green light to the Hinkley Point plant last September and has vowed to continue the “golden era” in Sino-UK relations, following on from the close ties developed by David Cameron and George Osborne.A trade deal with China would represent a major prize for the UK as it leaves the European Union.China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi visited Downing Street in December and the two governments agreed that work this year would include “enhanced trade and investment” as well as security co-operation and efforts to tackle climate change, Downing Street said at the time.
