President Donald Trump tried his hand at some diplomatic triangulation Wednesday, withholding praise from Russian President Vladimir Putin even as he hailed China's President Xi Jinping as his new 'gentleman' pal. 'I don't know Putin but I do know this gentleman,' Trump told reporters at a press conference along with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.Trump's at least momentary pullback from Putin came as his administration has held Moscow accountable for the 'vicious' chemical weapons attack in Syria, and came on a day Secretary of State Rex Tillerson got a chilly reception on a trip to Moscow. Trump said it was possible Russia knew about the attack in advance. The president throughout the campaign hailed Putin's strength as a leader, the FBI is investigating the ties of Trump associates and Russia.         President Donald Trump hailed China's President Xi Jinping as a 'gentleman' while withholding praise from Russian President Vladimir Putin at a press conferenceEqually remarkable was Trump's uninhibited praise for the leader of China, a country he railed against during the campaign for ripping off the U.S.Trump gushed about Xi days after the two had meetings and dinner at Mar-a-Lago, but reached no known accommodations on trade or Chinese military expansion in the South China Sea.'I've spent a lot of time with him over the last two days and he is the president of China. You were there, most of you were there and it was quite an interesting period of time,' Trump said.'President Xi wants to do the right thing. We had a very good bonding, I think we had very good chemistry together. I think he wants to help us with North Korea, we talked trade, we talked a lot of things, and I said the way you're going to make a good trade deal is to help us with North Korea,' Trump said.'Otherwise we're just going to go it alone. That will be alright too. But going it alone means going it with lots of other nations,' Trump said, without providing further explanation.

          GESUNDHEIT: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson got a cold reception in Moscow, where he held a press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov          NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (L) and President Donald Trump hold a news conference in the East Room of the White House         GENTLEMEN: President Donald Trump (L) pumps his fist as he and Chinese President Xi Jinping (R) walk together at the Mar-a-Lago estate in West Palm Beach, Florida'But I was very impressed with President Xi and I think he means well and I think he wants to help, we'll see whether or not he does.'Earlier, Trump told Fox Business that when he told Xi that the U.S. had launched an attack against Syria, Xi told him he was 'okay' with it. Trump also hailed the diplomatic accomplishment of China's abstention at the UN Security Council of a vote to condemn Syria. Russia vetoed it anyway.'We did talk last night, I think it's wonderful that they abstained, as you know very few people expected that and no I was not surprised that China did abstain,' Trump said, having spoken with Xi by telephone late Tuesday.         Russian President Vladimir Putin'Very few people thought that that was going to happen, so we are honored by the vote, that is the vote that should have taken place.'Turning to Russia, Trump said Tillerson had a 'very successful meeting' in Russia, where he met with Putin for two hours, then held a frosty press conference with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov.  'We'll see the end result, which will be in a long period of time perhaps. But the end result is what's most important, not just talk,' Trump said.He said it would be 'wonderful' if we could get along with Russia.'Right now we're not getting along with Russia at all. We may be at an all time low in terms of relationship with Russia, this was built for a long period of time. But we're going to see what happens. Putin is the leader of Russia, Russia is a strong country, we've a very, very strong country. We'll see how that all works out,' Trump said.'I'm also going to see about Putin over a period of time. It would be a fantastic thing if we got along with Putin and we got along with Russia. And that could happen and it may not happen, it may be just the opposite,' Trump said. 'I would love to get along with everybody. Right now the world is a mess, but by the time we finish I think it's going to be a lot better place to live. .... by the time I'm finished it's going to be a lot better place to live in because right now it's nasty.'         TRIANGULAR DIPLOMACY: Trump's praise of China and distancing from Russia, a power he has frequently called for improved relations with, recalls the U.S. turn toward China to counter the Soviet Union in the 1970sThe same images of babies who got gassed in Syria that prompted Trump to order a military strike appears to have clouded his view of Moscow, who is providing military support to Assad in Syria.''I would like to think that [Russia] didn't know, but certainly they could have. They were there. So we'll find out' if Russia knew about the gas attack in advance,' Trump said.'It was very disappointing to see. It was disappointing no matter who does it. But when you get into the gases, especially that form, it was vicious and violent and everybody in this room saw it all too many times over the last three or four days, young children dying, babies dying, fathers holding children in their arms that were dead, dead children.''There can't be a worse sight and it shouldn't be allowed,' Trump continued. 'That's a butcher. That's a butcher. So I thought we ought to do something about it. I have absolutely no doubt we did the right thing and it was very, very successfully done, as you well know.'
