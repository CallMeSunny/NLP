The Election Commission may end the suspense hanging over the Bihar Assembly poll dates and is likely to announce it on Tuesday. Sources claimed that polls for the 243 assembly seats will be held in five phases and that the poll exercise will conclude before Diwali. Officials said that the final meeting regarding the polls schedule will be held on Tuesday at the chief election commission office. They said that the three-member poll panel comprising Dr Nasim Zaidi, A K Joti and O P Rawal has already given final touch to the poll schedule. The election might begin before Dussehra during the second week of October and will conclude in the first week of November. The poll panel has analysed the festivities in Bihar and dates have been scheduled accordingly to squeeze some phases between Dussehra and Diwali. The festival of chhath, a three-day festival, falls six days after Diwali. An official said that the poll panel has taken into account festivals, holidays and floods before arriving at exact schedule.          The Bihar election is crucial for the BJP as well as for the grand alliance led by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who has joined hands with RJD chief Lalu Prasad and Congress in an uneasy allianceLast week, the commission held a detailed meeting with senior officials of the home ministry to assess the law and order situation in the state and requirement of paramilitary forces for the political battle. The home ministry has agreed to deploy 500 companies of paramilitary forces. Due to security reasons, the polling exercise will be first concluded in the Maoist affected regions and thereafter the security deployment will be moved to other parts of the state. Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi had visited the state in first week of August and said that the poll process in the state will be completed before November 29, the day the tenure of the present Assembly expires. Zaidi was on a two-day visit to the state for review meeting on preparedness for Assembly elections. He had met representatives of 10 national and state parties, as well as, top administrative officers. In the meeting, political parties had suggested regarding election timetable, floods and festivals. The total number of polling stations in Bihar has risen to over 63,000, around 3,000 more than the ones during the previous polls. Election Commission had also dispatched four special teams of ‘auditors’ to the state for weeding out duplicate entries from electoral rolls. The term of the 243-member Bihar assembly ends on November 29 and the new House should be in place before that. Elections, under the Constitution, can be held anytime six months before the due date. The Bihar election is crucial for the BJP as well as for the grand alliance led by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who has joined hands with RJD chief Lalu Prasad and Congress in an uneasy alliance.          Narendra Modi along with LJP chief Ramvilas Paswan and other leaders during the NDA’s Parivartan rally in Bhagalpur, BiharNitish slammed Meanwhile, senior BJP leader M J Akbar on Monday hit out at Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for mocking the Rs 1.25 lakh crore central package for the state asking him to explain as to why the earlier schemes were not implemented by the previous UPA government. “Nitish Kumar has described the Prime Minister's Rs 1.25 lakh crore package for Bihar as ‘repackaging of old schemes’ ... instead of questioning (Narendra) Modi, Kumar should explain as to why old package was allowed to stay old and not implemented,” he told reporters. “Were the people of Bihar not entitled to infrastructure development during the previous UPA government?” Akbar asked and stated that the so-called old package never saw the light of the day. Charging the chief minister with being derisive about the PM’s package for Bihar, the senior BJP leader claimed that it was the same Nitish Kumar who had gone over the moon after announcement of `12,000 crore package by the UPA government couple of years ago against the JD-U’s campaign for special status.

Yadav said that Mulayam had made Nitish, the chief ministerial candidate of the Janata Parivar, to fight against communal forces but changed his attitude later on. “After becoming the chief ministerial candidate, Nitish found it right to meet Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi first but did not consider it necessary to call Netaji (Mulayam),” he said. Yadav also alleged that Nitish and Lalu had not consulted Mulayam before announcing the seat-sharing formula of the alliance last month. “This was an outright insult to our party and the party workers,” he said. “The party, therefore, decided to contest the elections from all seats in deference to the sentiments of our workers.” The SP’s decision came at a time when the leaders of the secular alliance, especially RJD president Lalu Prasad, were expecting Mulayam to reconsider his decision. Mulayam’s decision might well pave the way for the realignment of the political forces opposed both to the Janata Parivar and the BJP-led NDA in Bihar. SP leaders indicated that the party might discuss the possibility of the formation of a third front with the Left parties and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in the days ahead. Incidentally, the SP’s announcement coincided with the joint conference of the six Left parties which was held in Patna to underline their unity for the assembly elections in the state. The conference attended by the leaders of the CPI, CPM, CPI-ML, Forward Bloc, SUCIC and the Republican Party of India stressed the need for the Left unity and called for ensuring the defeat of both the BJPled NDA and the opportunistic alliance of Lalu, Nitish and the Congress. Speaking on the occasion, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechuri said that the Left unity in Bihar would show the alternate way to the rest of the country. “The BJP could win only three seats in the Delhi assembly polls,” he said. “In Bihar also, it is going to meet the same fate.” A B Bardhan, former general secretary of CPM, said that the UPA and the NDA alliances had done nothing for Bihar in the past 25 years. “The future of not only Bihar but the entire nations lies in the Left parties,” he added.
