President Donald Trump says he's moving to take 'very, very strong action' against China and other countries that have been treating the United States 'unfairly' in the trade arena, regardless of the warm relationship he's established with Xi Jinping.The U.S. president said Monday in Japan that he's fond of Xi, the newly-elevated communist party chair of China, and the foreign leader likes him. But he won't allow their mutual affection to cloud his judgement, Trump asserted.'He represents China. I represent the United States,' Trump said at a news conference.         Donald Trump is due in Beijing on Wednesday where he will meet Chinese leader Xi Jingping on home soil for the first time (pictured at the G20 summit in Germany in July)         Trump has touted his relationship with Xi, calling it 'outstanding', but says he still intends to get tough with the Chinese leader over trade       This Wednesday Trump travels to Beijing, his third destination on a five-nation hustle across eastern Asia. As with every other stop on this trip, North Korea is expected to dominate Xi and Trump's discussions. Here, more than anywhere else during the visit, Trump - a former titan of real estate - is also under pressure to address the regional trade practices he said as a candidate he would fix. Trump pounded China for alleged currency manipulation in the presidential election last year that unexpectedly put him in power. He said as recently as February that the Chinese were 'grand champions' of the economic trick.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       'It has to work out!'

 By artificially devaluing its currency, the yuan, Beijing has been able to lower the price of its exports, 'stealing' American jobs, Trump has said. His assessment was rejected by the International Monetary Fund last year, and Trump's own administration has shied away from shackling China with the designation.Since an April summit with Xi at Trump's Palm Beach golf club, the U.S. president has backed off the assault.'The relationship developed by President Xi and myself I think is outstanding,' Trump said after less than a day of talks with the Chinese president and his representatives. 'We look forward to being together many times in the future. And I believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away.'                          Trump has not shied away from attacking China on Twitter, both before and after his first meeting with Xi at Mar-A-Lago back in AprilDays later, Trump continued to gush about his weekend in Florida with Xi in what amounted to a total about-face of his previous criticisms.'Now what am I going to do? Start a trade war with China while in the middle of him working on a bigger problem, frankly, with North Korea?' he said on Fox & Friends.Trump said later that month that it wouldn't make sense to label Xi's country a currency manipulator after the Chinese leader offered to assist the U.S. in its efforts to constrain North Korea.'Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem? We will see what happens!' Trump tweeted.China's stepped-up efforts to choke off Kim Jong-un's finances has not kept Trump from complaining about the gross trade deficit between the two countries nor has it had an immediate effect on the United States' enforcement of freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. Trump told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo late last month that the U.S. loses 'hundreds of billions a year' a year to China, and it is unacceptable. 'We lose with almost every country, we have massive deficits. And that is gonna change, we can't allow the world to look at us as a whipping post. Not gonna happen, anymore,' the billionaire president insisted.Monday, at a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo, Trump told a reporter who asked how the U.S. plans to enforce its mandate of a 'free and open' Indo-Asia Pacific without riling up China, a major power on the continent, that he's realistic about his relationship with Xi. 'You will be seeing things of countries that have been treating the United States and the United States worker and companies...our country, and our workers very unfairly, you will be seeing that the United States will take very, very strong action,' Trump said.         The President is currently in Seoul where he has met with Moon Jae-in, the newly elected leader of South Korea, as he tours Asia         Trump visited Japan earlier this week and after stopping in Beijing he is due to visit Vietnam and the Philippines before heading back to the USThe legal work is mostly finished, he revealed. 'And you're going to see a very big difference, and it's going to happen very soon. Because the United States, by many countries, has been treated very, very unfairly when it comes to trade.'Sandy Pho, an associate at the non-partisan Wilson Center, assessed last week, as Trump prepared to depart on his overseas trip, that the U.S. president was exiting the 'honeymoon stage' of his relationship with Xi.Trump is starting to realize that China is not going to do what the U.S. wants China to do, she said, and that China does not have as much power to compel North Korea as he thought it did. He is now 'slowly kind of coming down from this high, kind like a hangover' from the April Mar-a-Lago summit, Pho observed, and realizing 'he was wrong' about China's position.'He's figuring out that Xi's going to do what he's going to do for China,' she said, much like Trump is putting America first.The fading rapture is evident in the United States' rift with China in several areas, including intellectual property, Pho stated, pointing to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's investigation into China's alleged theft of intellectual property.The administration believes that China is behind as much as $600 million in IP theft through forced technology transfers.China's Commerce Ministry has called the probe 'irresponsible' and 'not objective.' Beijing would almost certainly bring additional U.S. action before the World Trade Organization.But Trump could unilaterally impose tariffs on Beijing through Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 if USTR determines that China is engaging in 'unfair trade practices' - a powerful weapon if he decides to use it.Trump has been hesitant to act against Beijing so long as Xi goes along with his plans to suffocate North Korea's nuclear ambition.Still, Pho says the U.S. president is 'fully starting to realize’ that the United States and China's goals in North Korea 'aren't necessarily aligned.' 'Xi's willing to deal with this despot on his doorstep, but obviously Trump isn't,' she asserted. 'But he's willing to deal with this for the time being because the other options, the US on it's doorsteps, or nuclear war on its doorsteps, are just far worse.'At a briefing with reporters on Sunday evening in Tokyo, a senior White House official insisted that the economic and security concerns of the Trump administration are wholly separate issues.'The United States isn't going to barter away our interests on the trade front in order to make gains doing what the entire world has, more or less, obligated itself to do, and that is to contain and confront the threat from North Korea,' the official asserted. 'So I don't see a comingling of those two issues.'Derek Scissors, the foremost economist on U.S.-Asia economic relations at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said the two issues are inextricably linked. 'South Koreans are looking at an obvious missile threat from a deranged state on their border, they accept US missile help, which is not going to solve their problem but at least makes it a little better, and the Chinese go ballistic,' he said of the present situation.Without a strong U.S. economic presence in East Asia, countries along the Pacific Rim are at the mercy of China, Scissors said.'The only country they can turn to is us, and meanwhile we're talking about bilateral trade deficits,' he proclaimed. 'At the time they need the U.S. to be more present, the U.S. is pulling away.'
