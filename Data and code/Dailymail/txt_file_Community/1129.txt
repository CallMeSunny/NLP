 ‘Governments increasingly regard households’ savings rates, asset portfolios, and wealth levels as key targets for public policy intervention,’ said Professor Deborah Cobb-Clark, one of its three authors.The report, called ‘Locus of control and savings’ claims people fall into two groups - those with ‘internal’ or ‘external’ locus of control.         Those who have an ‘internal locus of control are ‘strong believers in their ability to shape their own destiny’, while people classed as having ‘an external locus’ believe that fate, or luck - or other people - are the determining force in shaping their lives.  The Melbourne University survey linked psychological measures of behaviour to national savings data. The report said: ‘We find that households in which the reference person has an internal locus of control save more both in terms of levels and as a percentage of their permanent incomes than do households with external reference persons.‘Over a four-year period, households with a strong sense of shaping one’s destiny are on average Aus $150,000 (£82,000) better off, and save 7.7 per cent more of their income.‘Among the poorest 10 per cent of households, those with an internal locus are about 40 to 60 per cent wealthier than those with an external one.’Among average income and richer households, people with an internal locus of control were likely to have invested less in material possessions, which lose value over time, and more in pensions to provide financial security.The academics said that although they used Australian data, they believed the trends uncovered would be similar in other developed countries.
