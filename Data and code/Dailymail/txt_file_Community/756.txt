 PORT MORESBY, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping warned on Saturday that the shadow of protectionism and unilateralism was hanging over global growth, joining other Asia-Pacific leaders in urging free trade. "One who chooses to close his door will only cut himself off from the rest of the world and lose his direction," Xi said at an Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) summit in Papua New Guinea. Earlier, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said countries needed to re-evaluate globalisation and economic integration because it was leaving some people behind and fuelling inequality.
