     With kick-off at the Stade de Lyon at 8pm against a Portuguese side who have struggled to impress during the tournament, Wales will fancy their chances despite being priced as underdogs by the bookmakers.Portugal have failed to win a game inside 90 minutes in their five games so far, and have led for a combined total of only 22 minutes after taking a first-half lead against Iceland in the opening match and scoring a late winner in extra-time against Croatia in the second round.Welsh fans have been spotted gathering in big numbers at the Place Antonin Poncet in the town centre, draped in red and unfurling the national flag.
