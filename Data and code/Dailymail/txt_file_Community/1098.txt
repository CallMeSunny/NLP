China's Xi rallies party on Long March anniversary By Afp   Published: 07:02 BST, 21 October 2016  |  Updated: 07:02 BST, 21 October 2016                e-mail         China's President Xi Jinping attempted to rally his ruling Communist party on Friday by praising the Red Army's epic Long March which ended 80 years ago.The March is a foundational story for the party, which faces challenges including entrenched corruption and slowing economic growth.According to Communist Party lore tens of thousands of marchers including Mao Zedong travelled some 12,500 kilometres (7,750 miles) through remote and hazardous terrain during their civil war against rival Nationalist forces.
