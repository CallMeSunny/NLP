The European Union and United States have imposed sanctions on Russia over its role in the Ukraine separatist conflict.The Russian Foreign Ministry said this week that the Chinese president had confirmed he would visit Moscow on May 9 to join in commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the end of the World War Two in Europe. Other leaders, mainly from Asia, former Soviet republics and Latin America, will also be on hand.China looks to Russia for help in diversifying its energy supplies. Last year, the two non-Western world powers signed a multi-year deal gas supply that Russia's gas monopoly Gazprom estimated at $400 billion.(Writing by Lidia Kelly; Editing by Mark Heinrich)
