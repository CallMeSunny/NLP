 BEIJING, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Members of the ruling elite of China's governing Communist Party have written to President Xi Jinping to tell him of their efforts to "strengthen education" of their families, state media said on Thursday, part of Xi's stringent anti-graft campaign. Upon assuming power in late 2012, Xi has waged war on deep-seated corruption, with dozens of senior officials imprisoned. Part of that campaign has been to stop top people from allowing relatives to abuse their connections for personal gain, and to stop senior officials from unduly benefiting their families. The 25 members of the Politburo, the second most important of the party's governing inner core, wrote to Xi outlining their work, pledging primarily their loyalty to Xi and his agenda, the official Xinhua news agency said, offering a broad outline of the contents of their work reports. Politburo members also pledged to strictly follow anti-corruption rules, Xinhua said. "Comrades of the Politburo strictly enforce the rules of honesty and self-discipline of party members and leading cadres ... and strengthen the education management of relatives and staff around them," the report added. It did not provide details. Officials on the Politburo include not only the seven-man Standing Committee which has ultimate say over China's government, but also other senior people like the country's top diplomat Yang Jiechi, and Chen Quanquo, the party boss of the restive far western region of Xinjiang.
