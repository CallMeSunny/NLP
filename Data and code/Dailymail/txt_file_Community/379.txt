 The Carolina Panthers announced the signing of five players on Monday, highlighted by former Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Destiny Vaeao and four others with experience in the now-suspended Alliance of American Football. Vaeao, 25, has played parts of three seasons with the Eagles since signing as an undrafted free agent out of Washington State in 2016. He was cut by the Eagles last October and was signed to the New York Jets practice squad the following month, but never saw regular-season action. With the Eagles, Vaeao played in 33 career games (three starts) and recorded 27 tackles and three sacks. In addition, the Panthers added four others who played in the AAF. Rashad Ross, 29, caught 36 passes for 583 yards (16.2 yards per catch) and a league-best seven touchdowns for the Arizona Hotshots. His signing initially was reported on Thursday. Also joining Carolina's 90-man roster are defensive tackle T.J. Barnes, who also played in parts of three NFL seasons with the Jets, Buffalo Bills and Kansas City Chiefs from 2014-16. He has six career tackles in 21 games (one start). The other ex-AAF players to sign Monday are tight end Thomas Duarte and offensive tackle Brandon Greene. --Field Level Media
