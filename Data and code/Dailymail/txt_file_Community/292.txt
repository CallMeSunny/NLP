Donald Trump is no stranger to using his granddaughter Arabella's skillful command of the Chinese language to his political advantage - and he couldn't resist employing the same tactic while meeting with President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Wednesday.  President Trump, 71, proudly showed off a video of the six-year-old singing in Mandarin and reciting ancient Chinese poetry while meeting with Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan, according to the official Xinhua news agency.In the video, released on YouTube, Arabella, the daughter of first daughter Ivanka Trump and senior White House advisor Jared Kushner, can be seen wearing a traditional silk embroidered Chinese dress while addressing the country's president and first lady as 'Grandpa Xi' and 'Grandma Peng', bowing in respect as she offers a greeting to the camera. Scroll down for video          Clip: Donald Trump showed Xi Jinping footage of his granddaughter Arabella (pictured), six, singing in Mandarin and reciting ancient Chinese poetry, during his visit on Wednesday                She was taught well: Arabella, who has her hair pulled back from her face in a high bun, continues to show off her language skills in the online clip          Journey: President Trump arrived in Beijing on Wednesday and toured the Forbidden City with his Chinese counterpart (pictured) during the official visit'Hello, Grandpa Xi. Hello, Grandma Peng,' she says in Mandarin to begin the video, which appears to have been filmed in the White House, with the young girl standing in front of the American Flag in a wood-paneled room. Arabella, who has her hair pulled back from her face in a high bun, continues to show off her language skills in the online clip, which features English subtitles, saying in Mandarin: 'Hello everyone, let me sing a song.'In a clear and confident voice, she begins to sing what sounds like a traditional Chinese folk song about the country's beautiful landscapes and lush natural sites. 'Our fields, beautiful fields, the jade green river flows past sweeping rice fields; the sweeping rice fields are like a swinging ocean,' she sings, while swaying slightly to the rhythm of her tune, and smiling at the camera. Rubbing her eye slightly as she continues with her performance, Arabella finishes the song with the lyrics: 'The quiet lake is studded with lotus flowers, golden carps are so big and fat; flocks of wild ducks are hiding in the reeds.' Arabella then moves onto a poetry performance, reciting ancient Chinese poems with enthusiasm and energy, going as far as to make several hand gestures throughout in order to illustrate certain lines. Reciting quickly, and barely pausing to take a breath in between, Arabella begins to reel off lines from the Three Character Classic, a historical Chinese text which is thought to have been written in the 13th century, and which was once used as part of a child's education, up until the early 1800s.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Obama hails Republican humiliation saying 'this is what...
