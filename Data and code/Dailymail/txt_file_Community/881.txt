After Saturday’s key meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in Goa, China has called for both countries to "improve trust".But a statement from Beijing on the two leaders’ meeting did not mention or offer any commitments on either terrorism or the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group, two issues prominently flagged by PM Modi to Xi.And in a further message that may underscore China’s continued reluctance to allow India’s entry into the NSG, China’s top nuclear negotiator has warned against "selective approaches" that would "undermine" the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).         After Saturday’s key meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in Goa, China has called for both countries to "improve trust"Days before Xi’s arrival in Goa, Wang Qun, China’s top nuclear envoy told the United Nations General Assembly that “double standards” would harm the NPT as well as "undermine" its authority, according to a transcript released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry this weekend."Double standards and other selective approaches can only seriously undermine NPT’s value and authority, resulting in negative consequences," he said."NPT is the cornerstone of international nuclear non-proliferation regime."India’s entry into the NSG as well as China’s blocking the listing of Masood Azhar emerged as a sticking point in ties and figured in Prime Minister Modi’s talks with Xi in Goa.The BRICS Goa declaration on Sunday acknowledged India’s argument that it required a "predictable" nuclear regime to access technology to expand energy use and fulfill its sustainable development goals.India believes its membership of the top nuclear cartel is part of ensuring this predictability, but it’s unclear whether China accepts this argument.Modi also told Xi that both sides needed to increase coordination especially on the issue of India’s bid to sanction Jaish-e- Mohammed chief Masood Azhar at the UN Security Council 1267 sanctions committee.
