And then there was a section of kids that were sort of dragged in by their parents. And she was in the section of kids that came in and was excited, happy and wanted to do the shoot.'Rachel, who has also published four photography books throughout her 20-year career, use to specialize in child photography, and admits the We Can't Stop singer is her biggest client who has went the furthest in the business.          A picture says a thousand words: Destiny showed she had her eye on stardom at an early ageShe said: 'Yeah, she'd definitely be the biggest star, she's [also] the most outrageous star.Rachel claims she's most surprised at how much Miley has 'changed' throughout her years growing up in the spotlight.She explained: 'Am I surprised at how big she's become?
