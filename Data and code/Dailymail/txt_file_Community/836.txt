 BUENOS AIRES, Dec 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping wrapped up a dinner meeting on Saturday in Argentina lasting about two and a half hours with no immediate comment from representatives for either country. Trump and Xi sat down with their aides for a working dinner at the end of a two-day gathering of world leaders in Buenos Aires. Trump said ahead of the dinner he hoped they would achieve "something great" on trade for both countries during a high-stakes summit aimed at defusing a damaging tariffs war between Washington and Beijing.
