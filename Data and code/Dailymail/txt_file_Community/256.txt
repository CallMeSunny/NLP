 In addition, a banquet would be hosted for the US delegation in 'a Chinese cuisine restaurant' in downtown Beijing later this week, with Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He expected to toast the US delegates, the report added. The US officials and their Chinese counterparts meet for talks on Thursday and Friday.They are under the gun to seal an accord ahead of the March 1 deadline set by Donald Trump, though the US president said Tuesday that he was open to extending that, depending on progress in Beijing.'If we're close to a deal, where we think we can make a real deal ... I could see myself letting that slide for a little while,' Trump told reporters at the White House.

The leaders previously met at the Mar-a-Lago estate in West Palm Beach, Florida in April 2017But global stocks rose after Trump's hint of a deadline extension.Washington is demanding far-reaching changes to Chinese practices that it says are unfair, including theft of US technology and intellectual property, and myriad barriers that foreign companies face in the Chinese domestic market.China has offered to boost its purchases of US imports but is widely expected to resist calls for major changes to its industrial policies such as slashing government subsidies.The two countries have already slapped tariffs on more than $360 billion in two-way trade, which has weighed on their manufacturing sectors and shaken global financial markets.The International Monetary Fund warned on Sunday of a possible global economic 'storm' as world growth forecasts dip, citing the US-China trade row as a key pivot point.
