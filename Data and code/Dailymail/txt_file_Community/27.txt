 Watkins, 23, and her boyfriend called 911 early Sunday morning and were conferenced in a three-way call with an obstetrician to deliver the baby at home because rescue teams couldn't get out in that weather. For 45 minutes, first a dispatch supervisor, and then the doctor walked the couple through delivery, telling them to use a shoelace to tie off the placenta so that the baby didn't bleed. Destiny Knight was born weighing six pounds, 11 ounces.'I am just amazed. I am still kind of shocked, but I just think that I am here, she is here, and everybody is safe,' Watkins said at a news conference Wednesday carrying her sleepy newborn, who sucking on a green pacifier. 'It was traumatizing,' she said. Her boyfriend, David Knight, looked up and agreed. 'Yeah, traumatizing,' he said.'He still wasn't talking by the time he got to the hospital,' joked Dr Kendra Gillespie.'I just thank God everything is alright,' he said.
