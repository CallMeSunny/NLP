 As the country kicked off its week-long national holiday yesterday, millions of Chinese people are expected to tune into the five-part show, which is the second season of Hunan TV's ideological education programme, 'Socialism is Kind of Trendy'.State media People's Daily describes the show as a response to Mr Xi's call for 'a thorough study session among the whole party'. Jointly produced by Communist Party officials in Hunan Province, educations departments and the broadcaster, the show aims to 'help party members and young people to better understand new ideas and embrace China's new era.'Under a wider theme of Xi Jinping Thought, officially known as 'Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era', contestants from the country's academic institutions face various questions about Marxism, the Communist Party leader's formative years, his policies and theories and how they brought change to China.The second round of the show tries to stump candidates based on excerpts from Xi's speeches over the years.         Question: What does 'road' refer to in the 'One Belt One Road' initiative?         A screengrab of the new programme shows a contestant being grilled by the host'My hometown, China's Shaanxi province, is located at the starting point of the old Silk Road. Standing here, looking back, I could almost hear the echoes of the camels in the mountains and see the soft streams of smoke coming from the desert,' Xi's voice of boomed in the studio.'This is an excerpt from the General Secretary's speech at Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan. What important initiative did Xi Jinping announce for the first time in the speech?''The Silk Road Economic Belt,' a male contestant replied in less than a second, referring to the iconic Belt and Road development strategy unveiled by Xi in 2013.  Candidates face other questions including: 'What is the guiding ideology of the Communist Party?' 'How many years did Xi spend in the Liangjiahe Brigade in Northern Shaanxi?' 'What is the fundamental idea of Marxism?'A panel of university professors specialising in the ideology of Xi acts as judges and commentators, offering interpretations on the subject matter in front of a twenty-something audience.          A panel of university professors specialising in the ideology of Xi acts as judges, offering interpretations on the subject matter in front of a twenty-something audience         During his term, Xi Jinping has consolidated his power in the ruling party with various projects, including the Belt and Road Initiative and signature crackdown on government corruptionConcerns have been raised that China's younger generation is too far removed from the ideals of communist revolution. Propaganda officials are hence encouraged to use creative ways to promote and instil socialist values in the country's millennials in hopes of reigniting their devotion to the Communist Party while countering Western influences. In May, state broadcaster CCTV aired another talk show, titled 'Marx Got It Right' - also part of the party's attempt to boost loyalty to socialism among the young. Xi once called Karl Marx 'the greatest thinker in modern times'. During his term, Xi has consolidated his power in the ruling party with various projects, including the Belt and Road Initiative and signature crackdown on government corruption. During last October's 19th Party Congress, a major political meeting held every five years, Xi abolished presidential term limits that would have seen him step down as president in 2023.At the same time, the Xi Jinping Thought was formally enshrined in the Communist Party's amended Constitution, making him China's most powerful leader in decades. Hip hop, Communist style: China uses rap to teach patriotism       Despite China's rumoured crackdown on hip hop, its ruling Communist Party has shown interests in the music genre in the past - so much so that it has used rap to teach patriotism to young people.In 2016, Chinese state media used a rap song to promote Communist theories to youngsters raised under consumerism.The single, called 'Karl Marx is a post-90', was performed by a group of fashionable rappers and devoted to Karl Marx the German author of The Communist Manifesto.The Chinese Communist authority has also released an informative rap video especially for foreigners in order to inform them about 'the real China'.The title, called 'This is China', was produced by a Chinese hip hop group called Chengdu Revolution.
