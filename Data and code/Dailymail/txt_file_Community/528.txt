Two US bombers flew over the disputed South China Sea on Thursday, just hours before President Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20.The Pentagon's move was the latest bid to assert 'freedom of navigation' in the international territory, despite China's claim to virtually all of the waterway.The flight by the B-1B Lancer bombers took off from an Air Force base in Guam and flew over Beijing's man-made islands, as political leaders from around the world prepared for the summit in Hamburg, Germany.Trump and Xi Jinping sat next to each other during the first working session meeting, and were said to have discussed what China can do to rein in North Korea's missile and nuclear weapon programs.In recent days, Trump has issued a series of tweets that seem hopeful that Beijing will assist in defusing the Pyongyang situation, while also criticizing China for its increased level of trade with North Korea.Scroll down for video        Two American B-1B Lancer bombers flew over China's disputed man-made islands in the South China Sea as Trump attends G20 summit       President Donald Trump and Chinese President Chinese President Xi Jinping sat next to each other during today's first working session of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany         Trump and Xi are preparing for a meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit       After North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic on Tuesday, Trump tweeted about the possibility of China making 'a heavy move' to halt North Korea's continued missile launches         Trump's tweets implied that China could potentially stop North Korea from launching missiles just days prior to the start of the G20 summit         Trump's tweets also implied disappointment that China is still willing to trade with North Korea despite the country's continued launching of missiles and nuclear weapons threatsNorth Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile on Tuesday that some experts believe has the range to reach Alaska and Hawaii and perhaps the US Pacific Northwest.While Trump has been seeking China's help to press North Korea, the US military has, nevertheless, been asserting its 'freedom of navigation' rights in the South China Sea, at the risk of angering China.Asked about the flight by the two US bombers, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said there was no problem with freedom of navigation or overflight for the East and South China Seas.'But China resolutely opposes individual countries using the banner of freedom of navigation and overflight to flaunt military force and harm China's sovereignty and security,' he said.

 China's Defence Ministry, in a short statement sent to Reuters, said China always maintained its vigilance and 'effectively monitors relevant countries' military activities next to China'.'The Chinese military will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and security as well as regional peace and stability,' it added, without elaborating.The United States has criticized China's build-up of military facilities on South China Sea reefs and tiny islands it has constructed, concerned that they could be used to extend its strategic reach.Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan also have claims in the sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year.The two Lancers that made the flight had earlier trained with Japanese jet fighters in the neighboring East China Sea, the first time the two forces had conducted joint night-time drills.Two US Lancers flew from Guam over the South China Sea last month, while a US warship carried out a maneuvering drill within 12 nautical miles of one of China's artificial islands in the waterway in late May.
