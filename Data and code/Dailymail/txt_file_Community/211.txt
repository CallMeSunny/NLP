 She said she didn't realise the extent of her daughter's weight problem until the youngster struggled to fit into a size 14 shirt the summer before she began secondary school.Ms Deakin, 41, said: 'Although I was trying to encourage Destiny to eat better, one day, while she was at school, I discovered crisps packets shoved down the side of the couch and realised that she had been secretly scoffing snacks.'I've struggled with my weight all my life, going from a dress size 8 to a size 18, as my weight fluctuated dramatically. When I realised my daughter was reliving my nightmare - it broke my heart.'         Ms Deakin says she struggled to keep her daughter's weight under control because she had three jobs and therefore had to leave her daughter with relatives when she was younger              The mother said that part of the problem was that her daughter would 'comfort eat' after her grandfather diedThe NHS in Rotherham previously placed more than 100 children on similar camps over a three-year period as part of a £3.5million scheme to cut youth obesity.Destiny began in 2009 comfort eating after the death of her grandfather.At the time, Ms Deakin was working three jobs to make ends meet, so Destiny's grandmother, Joyce, 68, looked after her in the evenings.Ms Deakin says: 'While I made hearty meals with plenty of vegetables like cottage pie, my mum preferred meals laden with grease, like home-cooked chips fried in oil.'I asked mum to cook healthier dishes but she never listened.'While Destiny was in her second year of secondary school, she became withdrawn and hated going out with her friends.'She admitted that she had low self-esteem due to her weight so I took her to the doctors, who confirmed that Destiny was clinically obese.'She weighed 12st 6lbs at the age of 13. We were distraught.'              Destiny is now hoping to return to the camp to coach other obese children in how to lose weightAfter going to the gym but failing to losing weight, doctors suggested a 12-week course for overweight children at a local leisure centre.A co-ordinator at the leisure centre then advised Ms Deakin to contact MoreLife, a weight loss camp for overweight children in Leeds.The camp teaches children how to cook healthy meals, portion sizes, and to re-evaluate their relationship with food, over six weeks in the summer holidays.Ms Deakin, who is also mum to Macaulay, 20, said: 'The camp cost £6,000 but, thankfully, Rotherham City Council agreed to provide funding for Destiny.'I was relieved as I could never afford that cost myself as a single mum and I knew it was the kick-start that my daughter needed to lose weight.'In 2014, Destiny received another £6,000 of government funding to attend the camp for a further six weeks. She lost a stone of weight at each camp.               Destiny (pictured left during her time at the camp) is now a healthy weight for her height and ageNow Destiny, who is now a size 12, said: said: 'Camp was hard at times, but I had so much fun and my friends were really supportive.'When I'm 18 I hope to return back to camp as a volunteer to help overweight teenagers - after all, I'm proof that it really works. Now I'm so much more confident than ever before.'Ms Deakin added: 'It took £12,000 to change Destiny's life but I don't feel guilty for wanting to make my daughter's future happier and healthier.'You simply can't put a price on happiness.'No-one has made any negative comments about the cost to the council but I honestly believe that, unless you've walked in our shoes, you shouldn't judge.'
