Dan Carter long ago earned the status of sporting superhero and on Friday he revealed his chosen alter-ego — the Phantom, ready to haunt Australia and exorcise his own ghosts in Saturday's World Cup final.The eve of the iconic No 10’s Test career finale on behalf of New Zealand turned into a costume drama as the 33-year-old was asked about his unusual hobby. Carter was determined to focus on the collective significance of the grand occasion for the All Blacks, as they seek to become the first team to retain the Webb Ellis Cup, but he couldn’t side-step the primary agenda.         Dan Carter is aiming to go out on a high as he calls time on his Test career after the Rugby World Cup final         The All Blacks great missed New Zealand's triumph in the 2011 final over France with a groin injury         Carter practises his kicking at the posts during a training session at an empty Twickenham Stadium         All week, in the build-up to the Trans-Tasman collision which will decide this epic tournament, there has been a relentless focus on the imminent international retirement of Carter and four other Kiwi veterans; captain Richie McCaw, Ma’a Nonu, Conrad Smith and Keven Mealamu. The greatest fly-half and most prolific player in the history of Test rugby will no doubt feel more at ease in the eye of a storm at Twickenham on Saturday afternoon than he was on Friday.He was caught off-guard when asked about his fondness for collecting and wearing superhero costumes and said: ‘My wife made me get rid of them all once our first baby arrived and she realised they were taking up an entire wardrobe. She wanted that room as the nursery.‘I know it sounds a bit weird but Ali Williams (former New Zealand lock) and I, we like to dress up, so I started a collection of pretty much every superhero costume that there is. I’m not sure of the original reasoning behind that, but yeah, I’ve still got a bit of a collection at my mate’s house.’    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Australia accidentally reveal Rugby World Cup final strategy...

   When pressed to identify his favourite, he added: ‘Probably the first one I ever got. The Phantom.’New Zealanders would regard it as entirely appropriate if Carter were to don a mask and cape for Saturday's showpiece fixture. He has re-emerged as the darling of the nation, following a spell when injuries and form fluctuations threatened to leave him with career regrets.Had it not been for a vintage performance against Australia in Auckland during this year’s Rugby Championship, the All Blacks’ poster-boy was destined to be left out of this World Cup. But having made the cut, Carter has continued to raise his game and is now poised to savour global glory, having been denied by a ruptured groin four years ago.          The 33-year-old Carter leans against a rugby post while stretching ahead of the Twickenham final         The fly-half is among five Kiwi veterans calling it a day on Saturday after the Twickenham final         Carter was speaking at a press conference on Friday ahead of Saturday's show piece final         New Zealand coach Steve Hansen believes that the 2015 World Cup final will not define Carter's career  32    Richie McCaw has been on the field for a staggering 32 per cent of the All Blacks’ victories since 1903. New Zealand have won 412 Tests in that time - McCaw has won 130 himself.   ‘I’ve been fortunate enough this year to be able to string a few games together,’ he said. ‘I’ve been injury-free, which does really help. I love to play on the biggest stage and I’ve really enjoyed this tournament. 'There were moments when I thought it might be the end but you have to fight through that. Today I’m pretty grateful for that, and for the coaches sticking by me as well.' Carter denied that Saturday's game would define his record-breaking career and that sentiment was echoed by his coach, Steve Hansen, who said: ‘As a guy who has played over 100 Test matches, he has already defined his career as one of greatness.'It is an important Test match for him, but it certainly won’t define his career. That has already been written in the history books.’Carter is a central figure in Saturday's intriguing contest but there are others who will arguably have even greater influence. The breakdown battle between McCaw and David Pocock will be a crucial sub-plot in the tussle up front, while Wallabies coach Michael Cheika is preparing his pack for a typically formidable onslaught from the New Zealand forwards.         Carter looks to the sky and clutches the ball during an All Blacks training session at Pennyhill Park         Carter and captain Richie McCaw are two of the five Kiwis veterans who will retire after the final on Saturday         The New Zealand fly-half looks on during their narrow 20-18 victory over South Africa in the semi-finalThe All Blacks have been the world’s No 1-ranked team throughout the four years since claiming their Holy Grail at home, suffering just three defeats during that period of unprecedented success.Yet, pertinently, the last of those three rare setbacks came against Australia in Sydney this summer. Cheika’s men know what it is to lower the colours of the near-invincibles.Amid the usual search for omens, Halloween has been a deadly date for the Kiwis in the past. Over the years, in this part of the world, they have been beaten on October 31 by France, Newport, Llanelli and Munster. It has in the past been a black day for the All Blacks.But Hansen is adamant that his players ‘won’t be inhibited’. They have peaked at the right time in recent weeks in order to brush aside feeble France and fend off the more resilient Springboks.          Julian Savea joins his team-mate Carter in celebration after New Zealand sealed their place in Saturday's final         The All Blacks have peaked at right time in this tournament after knock out wins over France and South Africa         Carter believes he has been fortunate to stay injury free after groin problem derailed his participation in 2011For their part, Australia have reached towering heights just a year after Cheika took charge with the team in disarray. The transformation he has overseen has been remarkable to behold.Pocock, Scott Fardy and Michael Hooper have emerged as a potent, predatory back-row alliance, while the Wallaby scrum has been revitalised under the expert guidance of ex-Pumas hooker Mario Ledesma. Further back, wings Adam Ashley-Cooper and Drew Mitchell are clinically capitalising on the ammunition provided by Bernard Foley and Matt Giteau.Australia are rising fast and full of swagger again, but the All Blacks are favourites for a reason. Time and again, they have proved their ability to function under extreme pressure. Ignore the party line – they will be desperate to give their retiring greats a fitting send-off. That additional motivation allied to their innate class should be enough to complete another Kiwi triumph and allow their superhero to fly off into the sunset as a champion.         Carter and New Zealand will have to contend with Michael Cheika's revitalised Australia in Saturday's final   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Australia accidentally reveal Rugby World Cup final strategy...
