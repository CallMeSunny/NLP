 But in a conciliatory phone call in mid-February, Trump walked back controversial comments on Taiwan, creating an opening for Washington and Beijing to discuss a meeting.China quickly capitalized on the opportunity, sending its top diplomat Yang Jiechi to Washington.There he held talks at the White House, meeting with Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, his chief strategist Steve Bannon and US National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster before stopping in for a brief chat with the president.         Winter White House: Trump is using Mar-a-Lago as his regular weekend destination and a diplomatic toolDuring the discussions Yang suggested that Trump host Xi at Mar-a-Lago, according to sources in both capitals.Initially there had been speculation the pair would first meet in July on the sidelines of the G-20 Leaders' Summit in Germany.However, at the annual meeting of China's legislature , premier Li Keqiang said 'diplomatic authorities of the two countries are already engaged concerning a face-to-face meeting,' without commenting on timing or location.Trump's meeting with Mr Abe courted controversy when they set up an impromptu, al-fresco 'situation room' in full view of the resort's guests to deal with news of a North Korean rocket launch.       First foreign visitor: President Trump and the First Lady hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife Akie at Mar-a-Lago in February        The meeting was billed as an opportunity to bond over rounds of golf in an environment conducive to building the kinds of personal relationships that Trump is said to view as important.In some respects, Mar-a-Lago is a logical place for a first meeting with Trump.The resort's casual nature will allow Trump to receive the Chinese leader without the full pomp and circumstance of a state visit.And it will mirror Xi's first visit to the US under President Barack Obama, who hosted his counterpart at California's Sunnylands resort for an informal, shirt-sleeves meeting.Stephen Yates, who has advised the Trump administration on its China policy, recently told AFP that 'it is very typical for recent presidents to host visiting Chinese leaders outside of Washington.'
