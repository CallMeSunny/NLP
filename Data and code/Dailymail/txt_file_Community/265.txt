Chinese president Xi Jinping said he is willing to show 'patience' with the government in an apparent reference to the Hinkley Point delay. Prime Minister Theresa May irritated Beijing by announcing a pause to the project earlier in the summer hours after French energy giant EDF confirmed its share of the project would go ahead.The £18billion project is a joint venture between Britain, China and France to build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point that is currently due for completion by 2025.Downing Street said China was also 'open to a bilateral trade arrangement' with Britain after talks between Mrs May and Mr Xi.         Theresa May and Chinese President Xi Jinping had their first private meeting at the end of the G20 summit today       But the controversial deal - struck by former Chancellor George Osborne and David Cameron - is already late and is deeply controversial amid concerns over the guaranteed energy prices and national security worries about Chinese involvement.Mrs May and Mr Xi had talks today following the conclusion of the G20 summit hosted in the country's Hangzhou province but the specifics of the nuclear project were not discussed.But after the meeting, a Number 10 official said Mr Xi made clear he understood why Mrs May felt the need to take a fresh look at agreements made by her predecessor.
