 Sadly the French King becomes more of a burden as the episode goes on, and eventually leaves the Palace after spooking the royal children with guillotine-led tales.Luckily baby number six is born safely - and in a hilarious dig at her sister - Victoria names the tot after Albert’s mother Louise.       Conflict: As her vow to stand against the unruly Charterists puts her at odds with Albert, a shock twist thanks to the ever-scheming Lord Palmerston leaves the royal couple at breaking pointBut the Chartists' anger remains, and as they demand to present their Charter to Parliament, the Prime Minister - and Lord Palmerston - demand troops be placed on Waterloo Bridge to prevent their passing.At first the queen refuses, as she seems more focused on her reputation that her safety, but Albert insists they leave the Palace for the Isle Of Wight.But her mind takes a surprise turn - not once but twice this episode - as she agrees for the troops to be dispersed, after boxes of rifles were found in the Charterists headquarters.         Proud mother: Victoria's sixth child is born safely - and in a hilarious dig at her sister - Victoria names the tot after Albert’s mother LouiseIn an unexpected twist, the weapons were planted by an undercover police agent - with a very convincing Irish accent - who seemed to be working with the government and particularly Lord Palmerston.In a haunting scene as the Queen leaves the Palace for Osborne House, and is greeted by row after row of soldiers, she demands the Charterists be allowed to hand in their Charter peacefully, which they do to almost no surprise.But the Royal Family continue their Isle Of Wight voyage, and in a poke at modern interests, we see Albert hint at admiring a rude painting as he enjoys some time in the bath.         Protest: But the Chartists' anger remains, and they demand to present their Charter to Parliament         Halt: However the Prime Minister - and Lord Palmerston - demand troops be placed on Waterloo Bridge to prevent their passingBut the intimate moment is short-lived, as Her Majesty is left enraged to hear the Charterists handed in their Order without her presence, ending the episode on a sombre note.Meanwhile, after hearing that his future would consist of a similar fear for life and general royal circumstance, Victoria’s son Bertie - joining sister Vicky in a surprise speaking role - is left fearing for his future as the sole heir, though a heart-to-heart with his mother seems to offer clarity for both of them.Meanwhile the stunning Duchess of Monmouth grows closer to that ever-present Lord Palmerston - still played well by a charming Laurence Fox - as he saves her carriage from being torn to shreds by irate protesters.         Here she comes: As the Queen leaves the Palace for Osborne House, and is greeted by row after row of soldiers, she demands the Charterists be allowed to hand in their Charter peacefullyIt was a welcome spot of flattery for the Duchess - or Sophie - as she is belittled for being ‘childish’ and ‘snivelling’ by an ever-ignorant husband.And Feodora continues to worm her way into the Queen’s life, as she sides with Albert regarding the Charterists, hinting more and more of an ulterior motive for her arrival in England.But a lighter moment came as Nancy and Mr Francatelli finally - and I mean finally - tied the knot in a secret ceremony only attended by their footman friend Archibald, planning their lives together running a hotel.It already seems the tension between Victoria and Albert - which had been teased repeatedly by Jenna Coleman ahead of the series’ premiere - will play heavily throughout the series, and this clash may only be the start.Victoria continues on Sunday 7th April at 9pm on ITV.
