 WASHINGTON, May 12 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are likely to meet during a G20 summit in Japan at the end of June and discuss trade, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sunday. Speaking to "Fox News Sunday", Kudlow said over the past couple of weeks, China had backtracked from some its commitments and that the sticking point right now was to ensure Beijing puts the changes it had promised into law.
