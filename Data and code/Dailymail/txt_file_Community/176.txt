IDS must tell Cameron some home truths. Britain's European destiny needs to be addressed now By Nick Wood   Updated: 19:00 BST, 7 November 2011                     19 View  comments   David Cameron famously warned Tory MPs against 'banging on' about Europe.But ironically Iain Duncan Smith was the first Conservative leader to make his party take a vow of silence on the subject.IDS came to power after the Europe-inspired civil war of the Major years and William Hague's heroic 'keep the pound' campaign of 2001 that succeeded in its stated objective but failed to galvanise popular support behind the Conservatives.A Maastricht rebel, warned by Tory whips at the time that he was committing political suicide, IDS sought to broaden the appeal of his party by focusing his efforts on public service reform and a renewed commitment to tackling poverty among the fast-emerging underclass.      IDS was warned by government whips in the early 1990s that he would never get a ministerial job if he rebelled over the Maastricht treaty Much like Cameron, IDS recognised that the Conservatives image needed a makeover. But he wanted to do it by fundamental policy changes (like the welfare reforms he is now pioneering at the Department of Work and Pensions) rather than photo-opportunities like climbing on a sledge and hugging huskies.IDS decreed that it was time the party parked its obsession with Europe - the source of endless infighting between Europhiles led by Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine and a committed gang of Eurosceptics.Entertainly, he even silenced Bill Cash, the veteran Tory MP, who can and does quote the founding treaties off by heart. Bill was made Shadow Attorney General on condition he never mentioned Europe. The political equivalent of a pillow fight would ensue when temptation proved too much and Bill announced that he had just uncovered a dastardly Brussels legal plot to tighten its grip on the nation.     Justice Minister Ken Clarke was one of the Euophiles which were the source of endless infighting But all that was a decade ago and now the European pressures are again mounting on a Conservative Prime Minister. Responding to growing public hostility towards the EU, Tory MPs are in rebellious mood, furious over Cameron's decision to impose a three-line whip on the vote over a referendum and pressing for an urgent renegotiation of Britain's relationship with Brussels or even a straight vote on getting out.Against that background, IDS and Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson (IDS's parliamentary aide when he was leader and a close friend) are to have a private meeting with the PM to press the case for a change of policy.Press reports that IDS protested against the imposition of the three-line whip are almost certainly accurate but talk of a 'showdown' in Downing Street tonight is an exaggeration.The conversation will be undeniably polite, but IDS and Paterson will be urging the PM to acknowledge the fact that public and party opinion is shifting sharply against the EU - driven by the lunacies of the human rights laws, the ever-growing mountain of red tape stifling British business and choking off growth, the rising cost of Brussels, and demands for an indirect British subsidy to the imploding Eurozone.      Owen Paterson is to join IDS in a private meeting with the PM to press the case for a change of policy Collective Cabinet responsibility precludes IDS talking about his meeting with the PM, but the betting is he will be urging him to set out clearly his vision of Britain's relations with the EU, his shopping list of powers to be taken back from Brussels, the likely timetable for such a renegotiation and the prospects of a UK referendum on the outcome of such a deal.Cameron must wish that like IDS a decade ago he could park the European question and concentrate on domestic matters. But as many a prime minister has discovered before, in the case of Europe, home and abroad are inextricably linked - and more so every day.Read Nick Wood's RightMinds blog here
