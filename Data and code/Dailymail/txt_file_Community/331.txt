   Koepka began his round on the back nine and birdied the 14th, 16th and 17th before holing from 20 feet for eagle on the par-five 18th to reach the turn in 31.The 27-year-old also birdied the first before three-putting the third, but bounced back to pick up shots on the fourth, seventh and eighth, the latter coming in unlikely fashion.'It was an interesting hole to say the least,' Koepka said. 'It was an awful 3-iron (off the tee), hit it in the water and was lucky enough or fortunate enough to at least be able to hit it and advance it.         The American found himself in a sticky situation after having to play from the water'And then to hit 3-wood in there to 15 feet and then make the putt, we were laughing. It was almost kind of like destiny to make that putt for how lucky we were that whole hole.'Koepka, whose shirt bore the evidence of his escape from the muddy water, added: 'I thought we played really well. Putted very well. One little hiccup and three-putted from about four feet.'I felt like I started really well. Drove it really well. Any time you're making putts and you're keeping it in the fairway, you're going to shoot good (scores).'

'The last couple of weeks, playing on the PGA TOUR, it's a big difference for me. It takes a little getting used to.'It's changed me a little bit. I've been trying to push for it, obviously, and it's not coming out the way I wanted to.'So I'm taking a different approach this time and am just going to try and enjoy my first WGC. Dad's on the bag, so we're just going to enjoy it and sticking to the game plan. If things get out of hand, we try to get back in play and we try to wedge it close.'
