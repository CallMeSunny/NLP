Xi tells Abe that China, Japan should 'put aside disruptions' By Afp   Published: 13:58 BST, 5 September 2016  |  Updated: 13:58 BST, 5 September 2016                e-mail         Chinese President Xi Jinping offered Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe an olive branch at their first meeting in over a year on Monday, Beijing's official news agency Xinhua reported.The Asian giants have been at loggerheads over territorial disputes and historical animosity, but Xi said they should "put aside disruptions" in their relationship and return to normal development, Xinhua said.For his part Abe said that Tokyo wanted to "manage difficult issues" and promote win-win cooperation, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported.
