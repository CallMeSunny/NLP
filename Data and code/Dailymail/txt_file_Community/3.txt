 Melbourne United don't need to worry about the many NBL finals permutations heading into the last round of the regular season, they just need to win. Twice. United will set up a clash with Perth for the minor premiership and finals home court advantage at Melbourne Arena on Sunday if they defeat lowly Cairns at the same venue on Thursday night. Dean Vickerman's defending champions are second on the ladder, with Perth on top and Sydney third with all teams on 17 wins. United can finish top, second or third but Vickerman is urging his players to focus on the immediate task in front of them. "It's our job as management to plan for the playoffs and their job is to try to win a regular season championship," he said. "The goal last weekend was to try to secure a top-two spot (with two wins) and we weren't able to do that ... the Kings played very well and got over us. "But we got the one win which puts us in a pretty good spot. "If we go and win our two games we've pretty much secured top spot ... it's in our hands right now." The Taipans, who will finish a distant last with just five wins for the season so far, haven't managed to defeat United in three attempts this campaign. "They've finished the season strong and they'd love to complete their season with a couple of big wins against finals teams," Vickerman said. "We've just got to treat it as a game that we have to win if we really want top spot." Fourth-placed Adelaide can seal the fourth and final finals' berth if they can defeat the Wildcats in Perth on Friday night. If the 36ers lose Brisbane can leapfrog them with a win over New Zealand in their final game of the regular season. The Kings can steal second spot with a win over the Taipans on Saturday if United or the Wildcats lose their last two games.
