 “The Silence Breakers” – those who have shared their stories about sexual assault and harassment – have been named Time magazine’s Person of the Year. Numerous women have spoken out since October about sexual misconduct by dozens of high-profile men in entertainment, media, business and sport. Time praised those who have given “voice to open secrets, for moving whisper networks on to social networks, for pushing us all to stop accepting the unacceptable”.          Twitter  Find out why the Silence Breakers were chosen as TIME's Person of the Year 2017 #TIMEPOY https://t.co/jOS7zksnw7— TIME (@TIME) December 6, 2017   The magazine’s cover features Ashley Judd, Taylor Swift and others who say they have been harassed. Time’s announcement was made on NBC’s Today show, where longtime host Matt Lauer was fired last week amid harassment allegations. There's a long history behind choosing groups for TIME's Person of the Year #TIMEPOY https://t.co/MXfttZaza6— TIME (@TIME) December 6, 2017   Today host Savannah Guthrie acknowledged that this year’s winner hits “close to home” and mentioned Lauer by name. Women who spoke out, initially against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and then others, helped to spawn the #MeToo movement, with millions of people telling stories of sexual misconduct on social media. The tweets, Instagram and Facebook posts began after actress-activist Alyssa Milano followed up on a suggestion from a friend of a friend on Facebook and tweeted: “If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet.” The hashtag was tweeted nearly a million times in 48 hours.

Milano has said she was not aware of Burke’s contributions when she made her initial tweet and has since publicly credited her. The pair appeared together on Wednesday on the Today show. “This is just the start. I’ve been saying from the beginning it’s not just a moment, it’s a movement,” Burke said. “Now the work really begins.” “As women, we have to support each other and stand together and say, ‘That’s it. We’re done. No more’,” Milano said. “It’s vital to me that we really set in some actionable things that we can do to continue this momentum.” 'I was angry.' @taylorswift13 on what powered her sexual assault testimony #TIMEPOY https://t.co/MYHHwtRocJ pic.twitter.com/TQ3jnTpACD— TIME (@TIME) December 6, 2017   The two runners-up were Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump, himself accused of sexual misconduct by numerous women. He has denied any wrongdoing. Mr Trump, Person of the Year in 2016, had tweeted recently that the magazine had told him he “probably” would be honoured again if he agreed to an interview and photo shoot. The president added that he “took a pass”. Time has disputed his account.
