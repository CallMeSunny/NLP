President Donald Trump said this morning that he expects his meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping to be 'very special' but he has no specific expectations for what they'll accomplish.'It's going to be interesting. Nobody really knows,' Trump said on the Fox & Friends program. 'We have not been treated fairly on trade for many, many years.' Trump is facing pressure to deliver trade concessions for some of his most fervent supporters this weekend and prevent a crisis with North Korea from spiraling out of control.He told Fox News ahead of his Florida departure, 'We're going to see what happens.''No president's taken care of that the way they should have, and we have a big problem with North Korea,' he stated.  SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO               Crisis talks: The North Korean regime's escalating nuclear threat will dominate the talks between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping       The leaders of the world's two biggest economies are to greet each other at the president's Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach, Florida, late in the afternoon and dine together with their wives, kicking off a summit that will conclude with a working lunch on Friday. Trump promised during the 2016 campaign to stop what he called the theft of American jobs by China and rebuild the country's manufacturing base. Many blue-collar workers helped propel him to his unexpected election victory on Nov. 8 and Trump wants to deliver for them.The US is tempering expectations for the talks, however, saying they are only a 'first step' toward a constructive dialogue with Beijing. The Republican president tweeted last week that the United States could no longer tolerate massive trade deficits and job losses and that his meeting with Xi 'will be a very difficult one.'White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the two leaders would not 'sit around and play patty-cake' - they have 'big issues' to discuss, like North Korea's illicit missile tests.'I think he wants to have a very good and respectful and healthy relationship. But he also wants to make sure that he tackles the challenges and the problems that are facing American workers and American manufacturers and get to them,' Spicer said, characterizing Trump's position going into the meeting.         Venue: Trump is putting on the personal touch by inviting President Xi to Mar-a-LagoTrump, a former real estate magnate is still finding his footing in the White House and has yet to spell out a strategy for what his advisers called a trade relationship based on 'the principal of reciprocity.'White House officials have set low expectations for the meeting, saying it will set the foundation for future dealings.'I don't anticipate there will be a resolution on those issues, but they'll be both established in the framework for those matters, and I'm sure that each side will raise particular issues,' a senior administration official said. 'But I would not anticipate there would be a plan for resolving those issues.' The climb-down came after Trump raised the stakes in a Financial Times interview that ran on Sunday.'I would not be at all surprised if we did something that would be very dramatic and good for both countries and I hope so,' the US president said.

 Trump predicted hours before he left the White House for his Palm Beach estate that he would make progress with the Chinese on the issue of North Korea.'We'll be in there pitching, and I think we're going to do very well,' he proclaimed.U.S. labor leaders and lawmakers say Trump needs to take a direct, unambiguous tone in his talks with Xi.'President Trump needs to come away from the meeting with concrete deliverables that will restore production and employment here in the U.S. in those sectors that have been ravaged by China's predatory and protectionist practices,' said Holly Hart, legislative director for the United Steelworkers union.International Association of Machinists President Robert Martinez said the United States continued to lose manufacturing jobs to the Chinese, saying: 'It's time to bring our jobs home now.'Some Democratic lawmakers were eager to pounce on Trump on trade.'We are eager to understand your plans to correct our current China trade policies and steer a new course,' said Democratic U.S. Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts.         Hermit state: The isolated North Korean regime fired a missile into the sea on Wednesday and guards its borders - including its only open land border, with China - carefullyA group of 12 Democratic senators representing Rust Belt states sent Trump a letter Wednesday demanding that he bring up China's trade abuses and deny the country's request to be designated a free market.'We urge you to make clear to President Xi that the U.S. will hold China accountable when they are found to manipulate currency to the detriment of American manufacturers,' the letter goes on to state.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi sent a note to Trump stressing the importance of bringing human rights and religious freedom up in discussions.'I believe, Mr. President, that if we do not speak out clearly for human rights in China because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights anyplace in the world,' the California Congresswoman wrote.       The two-day summit that begins this evening will bring together two leaders who could not seem more different: the often stormy Trump, prone to angry tweets, and Xi, outwardly calm, measured and tightly scripted, with no known social media presence.What worries the protocol-conscious Chinese more than policy clashes is the risk that the unpredictable Trump could publicly embarrass Xi, after several foreign leaders experienced awkward moments with the new U.S. president.'Ensuring President Xi does not lose face is a top priority for China,' a Chinese official said.As such, Trump and Xi will not go golfing together at Mar-a-Lago as Trump did with the Japanese prime minister when he came to visit. For Xi, the sport is a symbol of corruption. He's banned members of the Communist Party from playing.'I think it's safe to say there's not gonna be any golf,' a White House official said of the two-day, getting-to-know you trip to Florida. 'Nothing involving golf clubs.'         NO GOLF: Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe tee'd off at Mar-a-Lago during their trip, but there will be no golf clubs this weekend, an official saidThe most urgent problem facing Trump and Xi is how to persuade nuclear-armed North Korea to halt unpredictable behavior like missile test launches that have heightened tensions in South Korea and Japan.North Korea is working to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States.Trump has threatened to use trade to try to force China to exert influence over Pyongyang. Beijing says its influence is limited and that it is doing all it can but that it is up to the United States to find a way back to talks with North Korea.A senior White House official said North Korea was a test for the U.S.-Chinese relationship.'The clock is very, very quickly running out,' the official said. 'All options are on the table for us.'       Trump consulted on Wednesday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who said he and the president agreed by phone that North Korea's latest ballistic missile launch was 'a dangerous provocation and a serious threat.'A White House strategy review is focusing on options for pressuring Pyongyang economically and militarily. Among measures under consideration are 'secondary sanctions' against Chinese banks and firms that do the most business with Pyongyang.A long-standing option of pre-emptive strikes remains on the table, but despite the tougher recent U.S. talk, the internal review 'de-emphasizes direct military action,' the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Analysts believe any military action would likely provoke severe North Korean retaliation and massive casualties in South Korea and Japan and among U.S. troops stationed there.
