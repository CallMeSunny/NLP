 It's not clear who was in the group at the bar, though it included then-deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin and then-strategist Steve Bannon, who has stated that he quit drinking years ago.The group then asked the bartender to leave so they could 'speak confidentially', according to an email written by Mar-a-Lago’s catering director, Brooke Watson.The Secret Service guarded the door to the Library Bar and forbade the bartender to re-enter, leaving the group to serve themselves from the bar, Watson said.As the night went on, the drinks flowed, and nobody paid. Six days later, staff at Mar-a-Lago calculated the bill and sent it to the State Department.The bill charged for $838 worth of alcohol plus a 20 per cent service fee. It covered 54 drinks, at an average price of $18.62 each, of premium liquor: Chopin vodka, Patron and Don Julio Blanco tequilas and Woodford Reserve bourbon.          Mar-a-Lago's catering director explained the charges in this email to the State Department         The bill for the booze charged for $838 worth of alcohol plus a 20 per cent service feeIt is not clear how many people were drinking, or how many drinks each person had. Bannon told ProPublica he did not drink at Mar-a-Lago, and that he did not remember the specific incident. Hagin did not respond to the publication.Trump himself is a teetotaler, and the documents do not suggest that he himself was in the Library Bar during the incident.The emails were released as part of an ongoing lawsuit between the nonprofit Property of the People, a Washington-based transparency group, and the federal government.According to ProPublica, Trump's campaign and administration have spent a total of more than $16 million at Trump-owned properties since 2015. Taxpayer dollars accounted for $386,000 of that spending, according to the report.
