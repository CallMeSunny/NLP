Some of us are old enough to remember when Britain was a serious country, a proper democracy, with a sense of proportion.When becoming a Member of Parliament was a solemn undertaking, when our votes actually counted for something. When MPs felt they had a duty to respect the will of the majority.There was a time when the laws and rules by which we were governed were decided upon after sober debate and enacted for the benefit of what we used to call the ‘silent majority’, not the noisy minority.         All you need to know about the mindset of modern politicians is that the Speaker of the House of Commons shows greater respect to a 16-year-old Anne Of Green Gables lookalike than he does to the President of the United States That, of course, was before the tyranny of social media, 24-hour rolling news and rent-a-gob radio phone-ins. Nowadays, the so-called moral high ground belongs to whoever shouts the loudest.Why bother voting when the only surefire way to change the world is by taking to the streets or summoning up a ‘Twitter storm’? We are governed by knee-jerk over-reaction to single-issue fanaticism.Corporations are as guilty as politicians of panicking in the face of online criticism. For instance, Waitrose, part of the John Lewis group, recently issued a public apology over a chocolate duck which someone complained was ‘racist’.         Elsewhere, Natural England has stopped farmers and gamekeepers from shooting 16 species of birds, classed as ‘pests’ and including pigeons and Canada geese, because of a legal challenge from ‘environmentalists’ and a BBC wildlife presenter called Chris Packham [File photo] The dark chocolate duck, labelled ‘ugly’ — in reference to the famous Hans Christian Andersen tale — was part of an Easter range, which included a milk chocolate duck, labelled ‘crispy’, and a white chocolate duck, labelled ‘fluffy’.This was enough, in the warped mind of one individual, to put Waitrose right up there with the Ku Klux Klan.Instead of laughing it off and telling the complainant to get a life, Waitrose went into headless chicken mode. The duck was immediately withdrawn from sale and the company put out a statement saying sorry for any ‘offence’ which may have been caused.Never mind the fact that anyone who considers a chocolate duck to be racist deserves to be sectioned under the provisions of the Mental Health Act, Waitrose simply caved in.Organisations go to absurd lengths to avoid causing offence, even where none is taken or intended.         Corporations are as guilty as politicians of panicking in the face of online criticism. For instance, Waitrose, part of the John Lewis group, recently issued a public apology over a chocolate duck which someone complained was ‘racist’ Here’s another example. The Football Association has announced that the winners of the FA Cup will no longer receive their traditional champagne because it might offend the sensibilities of players whose religion forbids alcohol.So the victorious team will have to spray themselves with alcohol-free fizz, just in case there are any Muslims in the vicinity. How long before Silverstone follows suit?Did the FA bother asking the vast majority of players, or the millions of fans who buy tickets and TV subscriptions? Of course not. What’s important is to be seen to be doing the right thing in the name of ‘diversity’.Elsewhere, Natural England has stopped farmers and gamekeepers from shooting 16 species of birds, classed as ‘pests’ and including pigeons and Canada geese, because of a legal challenge from ‘environmentalists’ and a BBC wildlife presenter called Chris Packham. Rather than fight the lawsuit, Natural England threw in the towel and revoked licences to shoot the birds, despite the fact they cause damage to crops and pose a threat to public health.

Share this article Share   The National Farmers’ Union is outraged, but clearly its opinion counts for less than that of a bunch of self-appointed environmental activists and a bloke off the telly. In Irvine, North Ayrshire, the Scottish Maritime Museum has stopped referring to boats as ‘she’ after signs describing vessels as female were repeatedly vandalised.So the criminal behaviour of a single nutter obsessed with ‘gender issues’ is sufficient to cancel out centuries of naval tradition.Meanwhile, Transport for London has banned an advert on the Tube for strawberries and cream because it breaches guidelines on ‘junk food’ advertising drawn up by ‘obesity campaigners’. No one actually voted for this ban but, apparently, cream falls foul of so-called healthy eating rules approved arbitrarily by London’s posturing mayor Sadiq Khan.He’s typical of a generation of politicians in thrall to online activism and street protests.Look at the way Khan indulged those selfish climate change demonstrators who have brought London to a halt over the past fortnight. Did he give a toss about the millions of Londoners who were seriously inconvenienced, or lost money, because of this pointless disruption? No, all that mattered to Khan was burnishing his green credentials.         By way of light relief, the funniest sight of the week was Labour’s Diane Abbott addressing eco-mentallists in Parliament Square and being greeted with a round of jazz handsThe same goes for those MPs fawning over that Swedish schoolgirl this week.She was even granted an audience with the Speaker, the ridiculous Jean-Claude Bercow, ever anxious to prove that he’s down with the kids.This is the same Bercow who is refusing to let Donald Trump address Parliament during his state visit this summer.All you need to know about the mindset of modern politicians is that the Speaker of the House of Commons shows greater respect to a 16-year-old Anne Of Green Gables lookalike than he does to the President of the United States — the elected head of our closest military ally and largest single trading partner.Still, Bercow is also determined to defy the democratically expressed will of 17.4 million people who voted Leave, so nothing should surprise us any more.Our destiny in Europe is being decided not by the majority at the ballot box, but by those prepared to make the most trouble.It’s probably only a matter of time before Parliament votes to abandon elections and referendums altogether and decides to govern via online petitions and opinion polls on Instagram.By way of light relief, the funniest sight of the week was Labour’s Diane Abbott addressing eco-mentallists in Parliament Square and being greeted with a round of jazz hands.         Meanwhile, Transport for London has banned an advert on the Tube for strawberries and cream because it breaches guidelines on ‘junk food’ advertising drawn up by ‘obesity campaigners’ [File photo]As regular readers may recall, this involves waving your hands in the air as an alternative to applauding, which might discriminate against the deaf and could intimidate sensitive souls who are frightened by loud noises.The only trouble is, as I observed when jazz hands were first spotted at a students’ conference a couple of years ago, the gesture makes those doing it look like Al Jolson singing Mammy.In other circumstances, anyone doing a Black And White Minstrels impersonation in front of Diane Abbott would be arrested for racism.I’d walk a MILLION MILES for one of your SMILES . . .Still, how long before Bercow makes MPs use jazz hands rather than shouting ‘Hear, Hear’ and waving their order papers in an aggressive fashion?Meanwhile, I’m off for a chocolate duck and a bowl of strawberries and cream.Hurry, hurry, while it’s still legal.  The good news is that a technology company has invented a device which jams mobile phones being used loudly on public transport to play music or video games.The bad news is that there are no plans to manufacture it commercially.So I shall just have to persevere with my own project — trying to invent something that delivers a nasty electric shock to anyone watching Game Of Thrones or listening to hip-hop on the Underground.Until then, a discreet cattle prod might do the trick . . .  The latest scare story from the climate change alarmists is that we can expect an infestation of fleas this summer.          The latest scare story from the climate change alarmists is that we can expect an infestation of fleas this summer [File photo]Apparently, the mild winter meant more fleas and flies survived and emerged earlier to breed.As a result of global warming, Rentokil already reports call-outs up by almost 200 per cent year on year. So it’s good news for exterminators, even if it’s bad news for polar bears and the rest of us. At least they haven’t blamed it on Brexit. Yet.  Don’t let Brexit curb your enthusiasm Not so long ago, all you needed to hit it off on a first date was a degree of mutual physical attraction and a GSOH (Good Sense Of Humour).Brexit has changed all that. Academics have identified five questions for potential lovers in order to determine their compatibility. The most important of which is: Did you vote Leave or Remain?We’ve all heard of relationships and friendships breaking down over political differences. But why would anyone let a mild disagreement over Europe get in the way of a bit of harmless hanky-panky? I’m reminded of the episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm in which Larry David eventually seduces his voluptuous co-star Cady Huffman, only to run a mile when he spots a photo of George W. Bush in her dressing room. Coitus is interrupted when staunch Democrat Larry realises she’s a Republican. Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face.Larry relates the story to Jeff Greene, his agent, who tells him he’s insane.‘I’d (expletive deleted) her with a Bush mask on!’
