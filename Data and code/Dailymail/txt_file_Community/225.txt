         Measures: BHS has been desperately trying to cut costs to avoid administrationThe fate of BHS will be decided today as landlords for its stores are set to give in to a restructuring plan which will see its rental bill dramatically reduced.The struggling retailer has been desperately trying to cut costs to avoid administration. If the plan goes ahead, dozens of its landlords will lose out on future rent.The plan, called a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), involves landlords agreeing to reducing rent on more than half of BHS’s stores. But more than 40 of its 160-plus shops are also expected to close within months as part of the deal.Landlords are due to vote on the plan today and 75 per cent of its creditors must approve it for the deal to go ahead.At the launch of the CVA earlier this month, chief executive Darren Topp said: ‘[It] is a necessary milestone in resetting British Home Stores to ensure its long-term future. Some of our stores are loss-making as we are being charged rents that are too high relative to today’s market.’   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Sir Philip Green sails into BHS cash crisis: Regulator...
