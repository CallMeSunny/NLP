And I didn't want it to be just any old piano room so we actually wrapped the piano with red crocodile print.'The print goes perfectly with her ceilings and walls which are white crocodile print - of course. Keeping with her red theme, the room's other stars are two ornate chairs which she upcycyled. 'We found them on Craigslist, they were beat up and we just re-did them. We painted them red on the wood, we have cowhide on the front and the seat and its dyed red and, as well, on the back we have the wool, so its dyed red as well so it looks like you have a little weave on the back.'          Food for thought: Leaving the red behind for a champagne and diamonds colour scheme, is her dining room, which has a large round table surrounded in embroidered covered high chairs         Inspiration: Above that table - which she got on clearance - hangs a giant chandelier, 'The chandelier to me is glamorous but it still has an edge, kinda like me'Her paintings were also done utilizing red and one has a secret poem hidden it - 'it makes it a great talking point when friends and family come over'.Leaving the red behind for a champagne and diamonds colour scheme, is her dining room, which has a large round table surrounded in embroidered covered high chairs.Above that table - which she got on clearance - hangs a giant chandelier: 'The chandelier to me is glamorous but it still has an edge, kinda like me.'          Not understated: Her penchant for unexpected colour really goes into overdrive in the star's living room which is covered in gold, silver and fuchsiaWhile each area has its own theme and everything is colour coordinated, as you walk through the home it still has a warm feel as Kandi has covered almost ever wall surface with her family's photographs.Her penchant for unexpected colour really goes into overdrive in the star's living room which is covered in gold, silver and fuchsia.Kandi - who also has her own line of sex toys - has a gold gilded fireplace as her centrepiece with a giant tufted sectional couch facing it.         Decorate and chill: The room has a giant silver sectional couch so all her friends can sit in once space         Transformation: The star and her designer had to hunt down a dining table and cut off its legs to make a coffee table big enough for the entertainment space 'I really like to entertain so it was important to me to have just an area where everyone can just sit and chill.'This is why I have this big couch. I had to find something that was going to be big enough to fill up the room and that I could just have all my friends over and we can sit in the same area.'Another prominent piece in my living room has to be this table, you can't really find a coffee table that is this big anywhere so my decorator she found a dining table that was really, really big and she had the legs chopped off.'         Making it pop: The 39-year-old says she understands fuchsia may not be everyone's first choice but it works The table is bright fuchsia: 'I know that fuchsia may sound like an outrageous colour but in this room it really works. It gives it a major pop.'While the decorating was an immediate project when she moved into the home - as well as fully renovating it including replacing carpet flooring with marble - Kandi now has a chance to let her inner decorator out again.She and her husband are expecting their first child together - she has a daughter Riley from a previous relationship - with 'Baby Tucker' as they call the child expected around the New Year.
