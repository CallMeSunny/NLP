China and New Zealand agreed to expand their burgeoning trade relationship during a state visit by President Xi Jinping Thursday, including a deal to allow television co-productions to be aired on Chinese media.Wellington became the first developed nation to sign a free trade agreement with Beijing in 2008, and Xi joined New Zealand Prime Minister John Key in hailing the success of the agreement."The New Zealand-China relationship shows that countries with different political systems, history and cultural traditions and at different stages of development can constructively cooperate together," they said in a joint statement.
