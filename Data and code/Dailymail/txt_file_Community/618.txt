 BEIJING, May 8 (Reuters) - China's President Xi Jinping told U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone call on Tuesday that the two countries should strive to find a way to properly resolve trade disputes, Chinese state media said. Xi also told Trump that China supports a summit between the United States and North Korea and hoped that the two sides could build mutual trust, and that the U.S. side would consider North Korea's reasonable security concerns, Chinese state television reported.
