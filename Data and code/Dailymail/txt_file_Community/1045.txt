Philippines pledges warm welcome for China's Xi despite sea row By Afp   Published: 18:11 BST, 10 November 2015  |  Updated: 18:12 BST, 10 November 2015                e-mail         The Philippines pledged a warm welcome for China's leader Xi Jinping at an economic summit in Manila next week, officials said Tuesday, despite a bitter row over disputed islands.President Benigno Aquino and Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario made the pledge in rare talks with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who is in Manila on a working visit ahead of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit."The president mentioned that he welcomed the decision of President Xi Jinping to attend the APEC summit," Aquino spokesman Herminio Coloma told reporters after Wang's courtesy call.
