 BERLIN, Sept 7 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in a telephone call on Thursday about the need to tighten sanctions against North Korea in light of Pyongyang's latest nuclear weapons test, a spokesman for Merkel said. Both leaders expressed deep concern about the current situation in North Korea, and viewed the latest North Korean nuclear weapons test as a signficant danger for the security of the entire region, as well as a violation of international law, Steffen Seibert said in a statement. "Both leaders said they supported a tightening of the sanctions against North Korea," he said. At the same time, however, it was important to continue seeking dialogue to peacefully resolve the current tensions, he added. (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Madeline Chambers)
