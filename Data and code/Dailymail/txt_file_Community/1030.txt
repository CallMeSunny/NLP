              China's Communist Party opens the 19th National Congress at Beijing's Great Hall of the People amongst tight security         19th Congress: Chinese President Xi Jinping delivers a speech at Beijing's Great Hall of the People as the Communist Party         The Communist Party of China opens the 19th National Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China         Inside Great Hall: Xi said, China would become a modern socialist 'strong power' with leading influence on world stage'Through a long period of hard work, socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, this is a new historical direction in our country's development,' Xi said, using the term 'new era' 36 times.The twice-a-decade congress, a week-long, mostly closed-door conclave, will culminate with the selection of a new Politburo Standing Committee that will rule China's 1.4 billion people for the next five years, with Xi expected to consolidate his grasp on power.Xi addressed more than 2,000 delegates in Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People, including 91-year-old former president Jiang Zemin, under tight security on a rainy, smoggy morning.

He said China's political system was the broadest, most genuine, and most effective way to safeguard the fundamental interests of the people, said Xi, who has overseen a sweeping crackdown on civil society, locking up rights lawyers and dissidents.'We should not just mechanically copy the political systems of other countries,' he said. 'We must unwaveringly uphold and improve party leadership and make the party still stronger.' Xi praised the party's successes, particularly his high-profile anti-graft campaign, which has seen more than a million officials punished and dozens of former senior officials jailed, and warned the campaign would never end as corruption was the 'gravest threat' the party faces.         Former Chinese President Jiang Zemin (bottom left) holds up a towel as other attendees clap during a speech by Xi Jinping'We must remain as firm as a rock in our resolve to build on the overwhelming momentum and secure a sweeping victory,' Xi said.On self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its own, Xi said China would never allow the island to separate from China, and said China would strive to fully transform its armed forces into a world-class military by the mid-21st century.He made no mention of neighbouring North Korea, which has angered Beijing with repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions and which sent a congratulatory message ahead of the meeting.         Great Hall of the People: China opens the 19th National Congress - decisions will be formally announced the end of next weekXi has consolidated power swiftly since assuming the party leadership in 2012, locking up political rivals for corruption, restructuring the military and asserting China's rising might on the world stage.Focus at the congress will be on how Xi plans to put his expanded authority to use.Key questions include whether Xi ally and top corruption-buster Wang Qishan will stay on past traditional retirement age and to what extent Xi will promote allies to senior positions.

That could include resurrecting the position of party chairman, a title that would put him on par with the founding father of modern China, Mao Zedong.Such decisions will be formally announced at the end of the congress next week.'In all aspects he is on the right track to be our next Chairman Mao,' Su Shengcheng, a delegate from the northwestern province of Qinghai, told Reuters. 'He will lead the party and Central Committee to continue its way to success.'
