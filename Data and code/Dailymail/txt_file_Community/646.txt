 SHANGHAI, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday promised to lower import tariffs and continue to broaden market access, at the opening of a week-long trade expo seen as an attempt by Beijing to counter mounting criticism of its trade and business practices. China would accelerate opening the education, telecommunications and cultural sectors, while protecting foreign companies' interests, Xi said. China would also enhance punitive enforcement for intellectual property rights infractions, he said.
