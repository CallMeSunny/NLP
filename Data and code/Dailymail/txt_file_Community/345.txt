Miss Puerto Rico Destiny Velez has been indefinitely suspended by the official Miss America Organization after sending a series of offensive anti-Muslim messages on Twitter. Velez, 20, launched an anti-Muslim tirade at filmmaker Michael Moore on Thursday after he shared a photo of himself outside of Trump Tower in New York City with a sign reading: 'We are all Muslim.' Moore's photo was in response to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US, which inspired the hashtag #WeAreAllMuslim on social media. The former beauty queen sent a number of tweets directed to Moore including one that said Muslims have 'terrorizing agendas,' according to a grab of the tweets obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Scroll down for video          Indefinitely suspended: Miss Puerto Rico Destiny Velez (left) has been indefinitely suspended by the official Miss America Organization after sending a series of offensive anti-Muslim messages on Twitter         Velez, 20, launched an anti-Muslim tirade at filmmaker Michael Moore on Thursday after he shared a photo (above) of himself outside of Trump Tower in New York City with a sign reading: 'We are all Muslim'         The former beauty queen sent a number of tweets directed to Moore including one that said Muslims have 'terrorizing agendas'The brunette beauty wrote: 'Muslims use our constitution (sic) to terrorize USA & plant gas stations.' Another tweet that Velez directed to the filmmaker said: 'All what Muslims have done is provided oil & terrorize this country & many others.'She added: 'There's NO comparison between Jews, Christians & Muslims.

 Velez, who placed outside the top 15 in September's Miss America 2016 competition that was won by Miss Georgia Betty Cantrell, also issued a statement through the organization apologizing. 'I apologize to the people I have offended with my words. I am first and foremost an#UpStander and as such I stand up against bullying,' Velez said.'The last thing I wanted to do was to bully anyone.
