          US President Donald Trump hailed his "great relationship" with his Chinese counterpart  US President Donald Trump insisted Thursday he was "very prepared" for a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping next week at the G20 summit in Argentina, and suggested a deal could be reached to end the trade war. The president will meet Xi on the sidelines of the summit, which is taking place from November 30 to December 1 in Buenos Aires. "I have been preparing for it all my life," he told journalists at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, where he gave a lengthy press conference after a Thanksgiving day telephone address to US troops deployed overseas. "I know every ingredient, every stat. I know it better than everybody knows it. My gut is always right," he said of his preparations. Beijing and Washington have been locked in a trade war since this summer, with the US imposing punitive tariffs on Chinese goods worth $250 billion per year. In retaliation, China imposed tariffs on $110 billion of US goods. Washington has threatened to toughen measures even further if the issue is not resolved before January. "China wants to make a deal. If we can make a deal, we will," Trump said. He also hailed his "great relationship" with Xi. "I like him a lot. I think he likes me. Probably likes me less now than he did before we did what we're doing," he quipped.
