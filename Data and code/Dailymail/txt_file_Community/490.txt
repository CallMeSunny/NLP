WHILE our own leader ponders over Bristolian property prices, Australia's Prime Minister, John Howard, intervenes in a far weightier matter: the destiny of the Ashes.  Having won them over eight Test match series in succession, he believes the tiny urn that contains them should be handed to Steve Waugh, Australia's captain, in Sydney early next year.  So do I. So do many of my fellow countrymen, along with 19million Australians. Yet the Marylebone Cricket Club continues to prevaricate. Apparently, the historic trophy is in such a fragile state - something to do with the glue which holds the urn and its plinth together - that it may suffer jetlag and disintegrate if subjected to a long air journey.  Come along, chaps. Are you telling us, in an age when we can split atoms and shoot men to the moon, that we can't discover an adhesive sufficiently strong to keep it in one piece?  Providentially the MCC's new president, Sir Tim Rice, has promised that when mended it will make a fleeting visit to Australia before returning to its shelf at Lord's. Why didn't someone think of this years ago? In fact, to save them the trouble, I could have slipped it into my hand baggage and trundled it down to Melbourne next week.  Yes, it is the property of MCC. Yes, it is insured for Pounds 1m but to deny it to arguably the greatest cricket team in history is not only perverse, but will probably add to the volley of bouncers that will fly around English batsmen's ears in the two remaining Test matches.  The Ashes were created as a joke following Australia's first victory on English soil in 1882. An obituary notice deploring England's defeat in the Sporting Times declared that, 'the body will be cremated and taken to Australia'.  When England subsequently won the Test series in Australia the following year, some skittish ladies bought an urn and filled it with the ashes of something they'd burned. To this day there is only speculation about what they'd actually incinerated. Some say it was a bail, some a cricket ball, some irreverently believe it may even have been a female undergarment.  But that's how the artefact came into being and for years now there has been fierce controversy about where they should be kept.  There should only be one answer. They should be held by the team that wins them. Let us hope MCC will do the magnanimous thing, get that contentious little object mended, and accede to Mr Howard's polite request.  i.wooldridge@dailymail.co.uk Why football parasites fan flames of anger and injustice THE REASONS this column sympathises with the fire fighters in their current dispute is that when one of my progeny inadvertently sets fire to my home, these men will be on the scene in probably 10 minutes, to drag us to safety.  I really don't care whether they play bridge or moonlight driving taxis during their off-periods. On duty, fire fighters are brilliant and courageous professionals, frequently confronted by the most daunting and dismaying tasks.  Early on in my days as a young news reporter, I was privileged to travel on fire engines with their crews. One day their job was to haul, from a deep well, the body of a woman who had committed suicide by leaping down it to escape further bullying from a brutal husband. All in another day's work.  I have no idea how much a fire fighter earned then, but today's average wage of less than Pounds 22,000 a year is quite ridiculous when a Premiership footballer can earn Pounds 100,000 in a week.  An excellent BBC radio programme on Thursday evening prognosticated that the game is going bankrupt. Of course it is, and thoroughly deserves to for its meek submission to footballers and their manipulative agents. Instead, think firemen, nurses and teachers, who are bereft of these parasites to negotiate for them.  TOMORROW night a BBC audience will vote for its Sports Personality of the Year. There is only one conceivable winner: Paula Radcliffe, runner.  The trouble with the BBC is that simple things can go awry. For example, three weeks ago I received at my home an invitation for Clare Balding, racing presenter, to attend the pre-show party.  My wife, leaping to all the wrong conclusions, wasn't hugely impressed by it. There was no reason for this. The thought of the delectable Miss Balding and an aged sports columnist having an affair is, I can assure you, mutually unlikely.  Let's hope the BBC does rather better tomorrow night. THERE is terrible news from the golfing front. They have tinkered with a bunker on the 17th hole of the Old Course at St Andrews, removing part of the sheer face of the trap immediately in front of the green.  The 17th is the most famous hole in world golf. Many of the game's most illustrious exponents have come to grief in the Road Hole bunker: Japan's Tommy Nakajima took five shots to extricate himself in an Open Championship. America's David Duval needed four.  Why change it? To save top professionals from embarrassment on a course they can already murder with their new equipment? Crazy.
