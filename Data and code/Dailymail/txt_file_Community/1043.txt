Xi in Macau as China cracks down on gambling By Afp   Published: 21:33 BST, 18 December 2014  |  Updated: 21:33 BST, 18 December 2014                e-mail        5 shares    Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives in Macau Friday as Beijing puts pressure on the gambling hub to diversify away from casinos as part of an anti-corruption drive and pro-democracy protesters prepare to march for free elections.Xi's two-day visit marks the 15th anniversary of the handover of Macau from Portugal to China and is also an opportunity to drive home the message that the semi-autonomous territory needs to see life beyond the gaming tables.Macau is the only part of China where casino gambling is legal and after the sector was opened up to foreign competition in 2002 it became a paradise for high rollers, overtaking Las Vegas as the world's gaming capital in terms of revenue.
