Suppose you were asked to drive to an unfamiliar destination. Would you set off in what you guessed might be the right direction and hope for the best? Or would you consult a map and save yourself umpteen wrong turns along the way?Most of us would surely prefer the second option. And yet, when it comes to bigger issues, such as achieving our life goals, we often stumble along without directions to help us. But there is a self-help tool that can guide you — offering a stepping stone between who you are now and who you have the potential to become.Known as numerology, it’s based on the idea that — just like everything else in the universe — our life is guided by numbers. Each number has a unique energy and by finding out the numbers that correspond with your life (often linked to your name or birthdate, both of which are incredibly personal and important to you), you can predict its future course.         Destiny: Numerology is based on the idea that — just like everything else in the universe — our life is guided by numbersNumerology’s origins date back thousands of years to the ancient civilisations of Babylon, China, Egypt, India and Greece. One of the systems, the Chinese I Ching, is widely practised in the Far East, and actor Mark Rylance has revealed that it led him to career success.But by far the most popular is the Western numerology created by the Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras more than 2,500 years ago.As you may remember from school, Pythagoras was most famous for his theorem that helps us work out the lengths of different sides of a triangle.But he also set up one of the world’s earliest universities, in Crotone, Italy. It combined religious ritual with scientific study, and the curriculum included lessons in how greater knowledge and understanding of our destinies can be gained from a study of numbers.When people question the validity of numerology, I ask them why one of the acknowledged geniuses of the classical era would have wasted his time creating such a system unless there was something in it.My own interest in the significance of numbers began when I was in my early 20s and a friend bought me a reading with a numerologist as a gift. I expected it to be a complete waste of time, but that 40-minute session changed my life.The numerologist knew nothing about me and yet her assessment of my personality was so accurate that it provided the credibility I needed to take on board everything else she had to say.I was fascinated and determined to know more — so spent years studying before becoming a professional numerologist.Now, 24 years later, I’ve given thousands of readings and taught numerology to people all over the world. I’m also the author of two books on the subject and living my dream of helping others.In this series, I will explain how numerology can help you realise your own dreams, whether they’re finding the right job or partner, travelling or going on an adventure, working on your personal development or starting a family.Here’s how...WORK OUT YOUR LIFE NUMBERLet’s start by identifying the two most significant numbers in your numerology chart: your Life Path Number and your Destiny Number.Your Life Path Number is the most significant of all numbers as it corresponds to something so personal to you — your birthdate.         Use this grid to find your Destiny Number from the letters in your full name. As a first step, Mary Ann Smith would be 4197 155 14928. Then follow instructions in Now Find Your Destiny Number, aboveMuch like astrology, numerology sees this as the driving force in determining your personality.Your Life Path Number reveals the deepest secrets of who you are and the kind of person you are at heart.While life may change you and bring other traits to the fore, your Life Path Number is an insight into the depths of your soul.It can help you interpret the path you’re walking — and what personality traits brought you there — the kind of experiences you’ll encounter on it and the lessons you’ll learn along the way.         Each name gives off a different type of energy vibrationStep 1: Add together all of the single digits in your birthdate. Make sure you use the full birth year — for instance, 1969 rather than just 69.For example, let’s say you have the birth date of October 11, 1969. That adds up in this way:1+1+1+0+1+9+6+9= 28Step 2: Add together the two digits in the resulting double-digit number, and do the same with the next resulting numbers until you have a number between one and nine. This is your Life Path Number.To continue the example above: 2+8=10, 1+0=1 and that’s this person’s Life Path Number.NOW FIND YOUR DESTINY NUMBERYour Destiny Number is the second most significant number in your life.This reveals what you are destined to do — while your Life Path Number is an insight into your personality, your Destiny Number reveals your aptitudes.It is particularly useful in choosing a career. But it also shows the kind of person you will become — the personality traits you’ll develop as you grow to your potential.By consulting your Life Path Number and Destiny Number in conjunction, you’ll gain invaluable insights into the choices you should make at key moments in your life — from moving jobs to moving home, or starting or ending a relationship.To calculate your Destiny Number, you’ll need your full, original name — including middle name — as shown on your birth certificate, regardless of whether you still use that name or were adopted or have since changed your name.Step 1: Using the letters and numbers chart shown on the left, write down your full, original name and match the corresponding numbers to each letter.Then add together the digits for each name to give separate totals.Let’s use the name Mary Ann Smith as an example:M A R Y       A N N         S M I T H4+1+9+7     1+5+5          1+4+9+2+8= 21             =11                 = 24Step 2: Add together the two digits in each of the resulting totals to create single-number totals.M A R Y       A N N         S M I T H= 21               = 11             = 242+1                1+1               2+4= 3                 = 2               = 6Step 3: Now add the single totals together. As before, continue adding together the two digits in any resulting double-digit numbers until you end up with a single-digit number between one and nine. This will be your Destiny Number.Continuing the example above:3+2+6 = 111 + 1 = Destiny Number of 2  WHAT YOUR NUMBERS MEAN Now that you’ve calculated these two key personality numbers, it’s time for us to consider what they mean. Remember:If a number shown below corresponds to your Life Path Number, it reflects the person you already are.If it corresponds to your Destiny Number, it means you are destined to become that kind of person. NUMBER ONEOnes often have their own way of doing things that may not conform to the norm.

It is an accumulative energy, increasing with each passing year, and it’s calculated as follows:Step 1: Add together your Life Path Number and Destiny Number.Step 2: If the result is a single-digit number, that’s your Maturity Number. If it’s a double-digit number, keep adding the two digits together until you reach a single-digit number.For example, for someone with a Life Path Number of 3 and a Destiny Number of 7: 3 + 7=10; 1 + 0 = Maturity Number of 1.Once you have found your Maturity Number, you can work out what it signifies by reading the explanations for Life Path Numbers and Destiny Numbers.While the Life Path Number shows who you are already, and the Destiny Number indicates the kind of person you will become at some time in the future, the Maturity Number is specific, highlighting your life path from the age of 45.For example, if you have a Maturity Number of five, you are on course to becoming a freedom-loving adventurer once you reach your mid-40s (and you may be well on your way if you are already older than that).  YOUR EXCITING NEXT STEP Having identified your Life Path and Destiny Numbers, you’re ready for the next step.In Monday’s Mail, I’ll show you how to use your date of birth to get more detailed insights into what lies ahead for you in 2016.In the meantime, you might want to reflect on the characteristics associated with those Life Path and Destiny Numbers that are not in your numerology chart.For example, if your chart doesn’t include a nine, you could still imagine yourself adopting its positive qualities. Perhaps you need to be more compassionate and less judgmental of others?Maybe you need to be a little more accepting and forgiving of the misfortunes in your life.Reflecting and visualising in this way can help you integrate the positive personality traits of each number into your own behaviour — yet another example of how numerology can change your life for the better.Extracted from Numerology by Michelle Buchanan (Hay House, £8.99)
