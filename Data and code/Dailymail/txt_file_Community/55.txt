RIP EJ.'Bradford, known to friends and family as E.J., was a graduate of Holy Family Cristo Rey Catholic High School in Birmingham and enlisted in the U.S. Army, his old teacher Carl Dean told the Hoover Sun.  Dean said he didn't believe that Bradford was capable of shooting a teen in the mall.'He was a super sweet, funny, kind and goodhearted young man who never had a bad word to say to anyone' Dean said. 'When I saw this morning that he was allegedly involved in causing the tragedy at the mall last night, I was shocked and in disbelief as well as heartbroken that this young man is no longer with us.'  Witnesses told WBRC in Alabama that the shooting happened 'between JCPenney and Footaction near the food court.'          Bradford's stepmother, Cynthia Kenniebrew Bradford, shared this family photo in a post where she wrote how she was devastated to lose her son         Mother April Pipkins posted on her Facebook page an image of herself with the victim Friday              Police on Friday revealed new evidence suggesting 'he likely did not fire the rounds' that injured the victimsCops say a fight broke out between multiple people, which escalated quickly.Hoover police Capt.
