   And on Friday he vowed to win over supporters reluctant to forgive or forget his decision to walk out on the national team.'It feels a bit surreal but I believe I'm the guy for the job,' said McLeish despite the SFA clearly targeting Michael O'Neill and Walter Smith ahead of him.'When I looked at other guys who have gone back to take charge of their national teams for a second time, like Dick Advocaat and Louis Van Gaal, I thought "yeah, that could be on for me some time".'The opportunity arose and I felt I had to go for it. Because I believe it was my destiny.'McLeish, who will meet James McFadden next week as he plans a backroom team which is also set to include Peter Grant, who worked in Belgium for Genk before leaving his last coaching post with Egyptian club Zamalek 19 months ago.Pressed on why he felt fated to return to a Scotland job he left quickly, he added: 'Because I believe I'm the right man. Okay, Michael turned it down. But you have to believe in yourself.'Since I left to go to England in 2007, it's been a lot of fire-fighting but I had quite a lot of success in those years and I've got a lot of experience.         McLeish took Scotland to the brink of Euro 2008 in his first spell as manager'It's the same with the squad - we have a lot of young guys coming through but you can't throw them all in at once. You have to let them mature and make mistakes. But they are coming along brilliantly. It's a great period for the young players to try and make an impact.'Of course, we also need the nous of the experienced guys.'In terms of destiny, I just feel it's the right time for me. I feel I'm a better manager now. The common sense factor grows in you and you see things from a different way.'McLeish had the firm backing of SFA president Rod Petrie but he also secured the support of Sir Alex Ferguson - a personal friend of governing body president Alan McRae.The fourth most capped player in Scotland history, McLeish won seven out of 10 games in his first spell.A memorable win over France in Paris propelled the national team to the brink of Euro 2008 before defeats to Georgia and Italy ended the campaign in bitter disappointment.         McLeish believes it was his 'destiny' to take over the national team once againHankering for the day-to-day involvement of club football, McLeish left soon after for a Premier League job with Birmingham. To the chagrin of many within the Tartan Army.'When I left at that time, I wondered if I would get another chance to rectify that, to be involved in something spectacular in terms of qualifying for a finals,' McLeish admitted.'It's looking that way now, because we haven't been at a tournament for 22 years. It's something of a massive feat but I think it is within our grasp.'The first game in charge is a friendly against Costa Rica at Hampden next month. Four days later the Scots play Hungary away before taking on a controversial trip to Peru and Mexico at the end of the season.Vowing to get round the club and build relationships with managers, McLeish's first priority is the appointment of an assistant manager and a backroom team.'I've made some phonecalls and I'm hopeful of announcing that maybe some time next week.'
