Judy Murray was in her early thirties when she decided her little boys - then aged seven and eight, who she was teaching to play on the public courts in the small Scottish town of Dunblane - could benefit from a bit more expertise.She applied for a place on the highest Lawn Tennis Association coaching course in the country. It was a big commitment as the sessions were held down south more than eight hours drive away. 'I managed to get a place on the course,' she says. 'There were 18 men and two women. One guy who didn't get a place on it complained, saying: "what could she possibly offer to performance coaching?" when I had two young children.         Judy Murray has established herself as one of the most influential figures in British tennis history           Andy Murray celebrates helping Great Britain to a Davis Cup final victory over Belgium to secure the trophy'The woman who was head of coaching education at the LTA at the time said: "This is what you're going to be up against".'That man must have felt a fool when he watched those two boys lift the Davis Cup for Great Britain for the first time in 79 years last December.Talking to Murray in the seaside resort of Eilat on Israel's south coast this week it is difficult to fathom the state the country's much maligned tennis system would be in had they not been born to a woman with such incredible drive. After watching her sons reach both the singles and doubles finals in Melbourne – Jamie won his with partner Bruno Soares, while Andy lost to Novak Djokovic - she flew here to captain the women's Fed Cup team.

   It is far removed from the gleaming packed stadiums of Melbourne with just a few hundred spectators on the courts of the municipal tennis club and the support staff doubling up as cheerleaders banging tambourines and shaking maracas between points.Without their No 1 player Johanna Konta, Britain lost their play-off against Belgium on Saturday. But this is part of a larger vision.'I see so much potential around growing girls tennis through the fed cup because girls generally prefer playing sport as a team, with their mates, than individually,' says Murray.'But while we're stuck in this zone, playing somewhere relatively obscure in early February when most clubs aren't even playing tennis, you can't use it in the same way as the boys have been able to use the Davis Cup because they have home ties.'To win Fed Cup in the future, we need to have a top five player, a back-up player in the top 20 and a doubles specialist. Jo is heading in the right direction, I truly believe Heather Watson can be top 30 by the end of the year and Katie Swan is coming through, so these are all good signs. But there are four times as many boys coming into tennis at entry level as girls.'Portraying the right image off the court is vital in addressing this imbalance, says Murray, who is much softer than the 'tiger mother' caricature of her teeth baring and fist pumping in the players box might suggest.         Murray speaks to Great Britain's rising star Katie Swan during her Fed Cup clash with Ysaline Bonaventure         Murray, captaining Britain's women's team at the Fed Cup, smiles alongside Swan in Israel on Saturday'For the Fed Cup dinner we all wore white Ted Baker dresses,' she says. 'We always have our pictures with the tracksuits, that's very sporty and great but we like to get dressed up just as much as everyone else. 'One of the barriers to teenage girls is that idea of "I don't want muscles or I don't want to be sweaty". When image is so important to young girls nowadays it's important to show here's the image of us as women.'I don't see the point in trying to compete with men's sport to get on the back pages because I believe the audience for women's sport will always be predominantly women and what do women read mainly? 'The female pages, news pages and women's magazines. Jessica Ennis-Hill been amazing in lots of ways and looks phenomenal on and off the track. The fact that she's now a mum and come back so brilliantly makes her a phenomenal role model there aren't enough household names like her.'Through her development programme Miss Hits, for primary-school age girls, Murray is trying to bring the fun back to junior tennis. 'It's all bean bags, balloon and bunting,' she says, 'We have to have bigger numbers every step of the way, at under 12 level we need to have 20 players we're looking at and not just two. It's about retaining numbers and female coaches tend to nurture little girls better.'         Swan plays a backhanded return during her match against Belgium's Bonaventure in Eilat, Israel Murray is a great champion of increasing tennis' female workforce. 'The more I've been working on the women's side of the game you have to work much harder to make things happen,' she says.'And women in the decision making roles tend to make things happen for women and girls. So we need more women CEOs, tournament organisers and coaches.'By appointing Amelie Mauresmo as his coach Andy Murray did much to alter the perception of a woman's ability to coach at the very top level of the men's game. 'Andy's used to having women around and he watches a lot of women tennis on the TV,' says Murray. 'I don't think a lot of guys do that. When Amelie stopped to have a baby, he got someone in in the interim and she decided she wanted to come back to work the baby came on the road in Australia and he was loving that because obviously he's going to be a dad soon so that gave him a bit of practice and insight.'We're all products of our environment and maybe it's because Andy's not afraid to be himself around women. I was the one around the whole way through and although I took a back seat on the coaching side it was about managing the scheduling, making sure everything was paid for.'I learned how to do massage when the boys were younger – paying for a massage was about €25s a time and I was like "I must be able to do that," I took a PR course, learned how to do tax returns in three different countries because we couldn't afford to pay accountants, we were just a very normal family.         France's Fed Cup captain Amelie Mauresmo (left) celebrates with her player Caroline Garcia 'I just saw it as "this is what my kids want to do, how do I help them to do it". I never would've imagined we would've ended up like we did.'One of the most touching moments of this year's Australian Open was to see Andy Murray at 1am on the day of his final stood in the stands of the Rod Laver Arena clapping as Jamie won his first Grand Slam.'It didn't surprise me,' Judy says proudly. 'It was a massive moment in Jamie's life. He doesn't watch a lot of Jamie's matches because he gets almost physically sick with nerves but he also knows he can be a big distraction to Jamie because he goes out in the crowd and it becomes about Andy.'I wonder if there are still pinch yourself moments in Murray's life? 'We talk about it sometimes when the three of us are together,' she says. 'In Melbourne and Andy said to me: "it's amazing we've both got to the top of the game isn't it mum?" But I think it hits me the most when I'm at Dunblane tennis club where it all began and there's pictures of them on the wall as wee kids in amongst all the other kids.'I think it's probably a nice story as it shows it's not about what you have, it's what you do with what you have.'
