It's Europe or bust for wing wizard Bale as he waits to discover Spurs destiny By Joe Bernstein for the Daily Mail   Published: 23:59 BST, 18 May 2013  |  Updated: 23:59 BST, 18 May 2013    


         e-mail          22 View  comments    Tottenham face a huge battle to keep hold of £60million star Gareth Bale if their Champions League campaign ends today in failure.Real Madrid, Manchester United and Manchester City are all circling the Wales winger, who this season completed his own personal treble of player-of-the-year awards.Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is desperate to keep hold of Bale to give his side an opportunity of challenging towards the top of the Premier League next season.      Main man: Gareth Bale has been instrumental in leading Tottenham's charge for the top four But the 23-year-old is growing increasingly despondent at the prospect of another year without Champions League football, particularly as he will not be playing in next year’s World Cup.Fifth-place Spurs go into this afternoon’s final round of Premier League games, dubbed ‘Judgment Sunday’, needing to beat Sunderland at home and for Arsenal to fail to win at Newcastle in order to qualify for Europe’s top competition.Bale failed to commit his future to Spurs when collecting his Football Writers’ Footballer-of-the-Year award this month. And the Mail on Sunday understand reports that he is currently in negotiations over a new deal with the club are wide of the mark.Madrid regard Bale as their No1 target this summer. Manchester City are keen to sign new A-list players after two failures in the Champions League, while the prospects of Bale agreeing to join United have increased with the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson — who failed to lure the player to  Old Trafford when he was at Southampton — and uncertainty over the future of Wayne Rooney.Bale has shot into the A-list of European footballers this season with 30 goals for club and country. He also won the PFA player and young player-of-the-year awards, the first recipient since Cristiano Ronaldo to enjoy a clean sweep of all three major personal honours.      Helping hand: Tottenham boss Andre Villas Boas (left) owes a lot to Bale's performances Originally a left-back, Bale pushed forward as a thrilling left winger but now sees his long-term future playing in a central free role behind a striker. If he pushes to leave White Hart Lane to further his own career, it will provide a fascinating  stand-off with Levy. The Tottenham chief showed with Luka Modric’s attempts to join Chelsea that he is capable of standing his ground.However, with the money on offer for Bale, Spurs would be unwilling to keep an unhappy player, particularly as manager Andre Villas-Boas has other transfer targets in mind, including Joao Moutinho, Christian Benteke, Leandro and Roberto Soldado.Should Spurs be celebrating a  top-four finish today, it would become much harder for Madrid to lure Bale. He has a settled family life in England with a young baby and is one of the faces of BT Sport, who will show live Premier League games for the first time next term.If Spurs do attempt to try and ‘bribe’ Bale with a new contract to spend an extra season in the Europa League, he is likely to want parity with the best players in the Premier League, Robin van Persie and Yaya Toure, who earn £220,000 a week.For Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, today is about his team holding their nerve and completing a stunning end to the season.      Laden: Bale was named Player and Young Player of the Year by the PFA earlier this year Arsenal, seven points adrift of Tottenham after losing at White Hart Lane in March, are unbeaten in nine matches and Wenger said: ‘We know how to behave to win the games, so it’s about getting that certainty from our long run and bringing that into our next game. It’s as simple as that.’Wenger is delighted that today’s match at Newcastle is of such significance to Arsenal — but means so little to Newcastle.‘We have to focus on our qualities but I think it’s better for us that they are under no pressure,’ said the Frenchman. ‘The pressure is big, of course, but I always said the worst [challenge] in my job is to play games without any pressure.‘Sometimes you think it would be nice to have a game with no pressure, but when you have one you think, ‘let’s get it back, it’s so boring’.‘We have what we wanted, so let’s just finish the job.’Arsenal, who are set to complete the free transfer of France  Under-21 forward Yaya Sanogo from Auxerre, will have striker Olivier Giroud available again following his three-match suspension, but midfielder Mikel Arteta is a major doubt for the match with a calf injury.
