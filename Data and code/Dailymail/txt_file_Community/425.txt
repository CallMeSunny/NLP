Battle lines have been drawn for the Westminster showdown over Brexit after the government tabled the legislation that will finally trigger Article 50.The 'notification of withdrawal' Bill will empower ministers formally to tell the EU we want to quit. The text will be at the heart of the impending 'hand to hand combat' in parliament - sparked by the Supreme Court's ruling that Theresa May cannot use executive powers to invoke Brexit.          The text will be at the heart of the impending 'hand to hand combat' in parliament - sparked by the Supreme Court's ruling that Theresa May cannot use executive powers to invoke Brexit         Theresa May, pictured at PMQs yesterday, has vowed to keep to her timetable of triggering the Brexit process by the end of March         The Leader of the Commons, David Lidington, announced today that there will be five days of debate on the BillPro-EU parties are set to try to make dozens of amendments in a bid to hem the PM in when she begins negotiations with the bloc.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has already tabled a series of amendments that will seek to force the Government to into giving a vote to MPs before it is signed off by EU leaders.But the government has kept the bill as short as possible to limit the scope for changes.The two-paragraph legislation states: 'The Prime Minister may notify, under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on the European Union, the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the EU.

 'This section has effect despite any provision made by or under the European Communities Act 1972 or any other enactment.' Europhile MP claimed ministers were trying to 'gag' them today after the Leader of the Commons, David Lidington, announced there will be five days of debate on the Bill.The 'second reading' - when the legislation formally comes before the House for the first time - will start on Tuesday and culminate in crunch votes on Wednesday.         David Davis's parliamentary aide, Tory MP Stewart Jackson, posted the text of the Bill today saying it was an 'historic day'         Mr Davis had reiterated the government's determination to keep to its timetable for leaving the EU during Commons questions earlier today                  Labour MPs Chris Leslie and Ben Bradshaw voiced fury about the government's plan for five days of debate on the BillThe committee and report stages will take place between Monday and Wednesday the following week. Despite the vows to amend the Bill and complaints that not enough time has been allowed for debate, the authorisation for Article 50 is expected to be passed with a big majority.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is imposing a three-line whip on his MPs supporting the legislation in the final vote, which has already led to Tulip Siddiq quitting his frontbench.  The shadow minister for early years said she 'cannot reconcile myself to the frontbench position' in supporting the Article 50 bill, which will notify Brussels of our intention to leave the EU.At least five more frontbenchers have signalled they will also quit Mr Corbyn's shadow ministerial team so they can oppose the Article 50 bill.    THE TEXT OF THE EU NOTIFICATION BILL   'The Prime Minister may notify, under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on the European Union, the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the EU. 'This section has effect despite any provision made by or under the European Communities Act 1972 or any other enactment.'   Confirming he will order his MPs to back the legislation, Mr Corbyn told Sky News: 'It’s clearly a three-line whip. It is a vote on the article 50... We will put out a statement today to our members that we want them to vote for article 50.' The Article 50 bill could face greater obstacles when the legislation comes to the House of Lords.Mrs May warned pro- Brussels MPs yesterday that they won’t be able to block Brexit – even if they vote down her final deal with the EU.In an uncompromising message to Remainers, the Prime Minister said Britain could instead revert to a system of tariffs based on World Trade Organisation rules.Mrs May said she was confident she could ‘negotiate a good trade deal ... because it will be in our interests and the interests of the European Union to do so’.But asked whether there might be an option for MPs to vote to remain in the EU rather than accept a bad deal, the PM’s spokesman later said: ‘We are not going to give them an alternative which would be against the will of the British people.’ WHY THE BREXIT WHITE PAPER COULD END UP IN COURT  White Papers are routinely used by ministers to set out policy ideas in detail ahead of legislation.The documents, which can run to hundreds of pages, allow MPs, lobbying groups and others to comment before policy becomes law.Critics have pointed out that previous prime ministers have published a White Paper in advance of every new EU treaty, setting out broad negotiating priorities. The document ahead of the Lisbon Treaty in 2007, for example, ran to 42 pages.However, White Papers have sometimes formed the basis for judicial reviews – leading to protracted legal action in the courts. Theresa May has so far resisted publishing a paper on Brexit over concern it could tie her hands during negotiations with Brussels and open the door to legal challenges. She has backed down over fears of a Commons defeat.Sources suggest the Brexit White Paper is likely to offer little more than the 12-point plan for leaving the EU that Mrs May set out last week. In a surprise move, Mrs May bowed to demands by rebel Tories to publish a formal document setting out her aims for the Brexit negotiations.With Tory rebels including former ministers Dominic Grieve, Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry threatening to join forces with Labour on the issue, Downing Street decided to concede rather than suffer an embarrassing Commons defeat.Sources indicated the document would contain little new information and was likely to be published early next month. Ministers have pledged that MPs will get a binding vote on the final Brexit deal, which is expected in 2019.Pro-Remain MPs believe it could be the springboard for keeping Britain in the EU, or retaining key aspects of membership such as the free movement of people. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said: ‘We will not get in the way of it, but we will try and amend the legislation in order to ensure that they keep coming back, that we keep an eye on them. And, if necessary, there will be hand-to-hand combat on this.’Up to 60 Labour MPs – including several frontbenchers – are threatening to defy Mr Corbyn next week by refusing to vote for Article 50 legislation. But a spokesman for the Labour leader yesterday refused to say whether frontbenchers such as shadow foreign minister Catherine West and shadow education minister Tulip Siddiq would face the sack.The spokesman said Mr Corbyn recognised there were ‘difficulties for some MPs’ who opposed Brexit.        Labour has warned of ‘hand-to-hand combat’ with the government over the Brexit Bill but Jeremy Corbyn insists the party will not seek to block Article 50       Announcing the plan to publish a White Paper yesterday, Mrs May said she accepted that there was an ‘appetite’ among MPs for a formal document to debate. The PM said it would set out ‘a bold vision for Britain for the future’. But, perhaps mindful of future legal challenges, she said the release of the formal document was ‘separate’ from the legislation to trigger Article 50.Labour hailed the decision to publish a White Paper on Brexit as a ‘significant and welcome U-turn’ – and said it must be released in time for the first votes on the Article 50 law, which are expected next Wednesday. However, Government sources indicated it was likely to closely follow Mrs May’s 12-point plan for cutting ties with Brussels, which she outlined in a major speech last week.White Papers have frequently been used as the basis for judicial reviews in the past and former Tory Cabinet minister Theresa Villiers warned that the climbdown could result in further court challenges.But Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg dismissed the warnings – pointing out that British courts could not derail the two-year exit process once Article 50 has been triggered.‘Further judicial reviews won’t help those trying to thwart the will of the people,’ he said.He said it was plain that Labour was still working to frustrate the process of leaving the EU.‘It doesn’t take [wartime code breaking station] Bletchley Park to decode Pat McFadden’s view,’ he said. ‘He wants to stay in the EU at all costs.’ CORBYN FACES MASS RESIGNATIONS OVER BREXIT BILL           Jeremy Corbyn has imposed a three-line whip on Labour MPs for the Article 50 billJeremy Corbyn faces another round of frontbench resignations after he ordered all Labour MPs to back the Government's legislation to start Brexit. He confirmed he will impose a three-line whip to support the Article 50 bill, but insisted he 'fully understands' why some Labour MPs representing constituencies who voted Remain would want to vote against the legislation. Shadow ministers who defy a three-line whip normally resign from the frontbench or face being sacked. At least five frontbenchers have signalled they will quit Mr Corbyn's shadow ministerial team. Tulip Siddiq, whose Hampstead and Kilburn constituency backed Remain, has confirmed she will resign. Fellow shadow cabinet members Jo Stevens and Dawn Butler are also said they are considering resigning, as well as junior shadow ministers Catherine West, Daniel Zeichner and Thangam Debboniare.But shadow business secretary Clive Lewis dismissed reports he was considering defying the whip. He issued a statement this afternoon explaining that he will 'join my colleagues in voting for the bill' - a week after signalling he would vote against triggering Article 50. Mr Corbyn told Sky News: 'It will be a clear decision that we want all of our MPs to support the article 50 vote when it comes up next week.'Confirming it will be a three-line whip, he said: 'It’s clearly a three-line whip. It is a vote on the article 50... We will put out a statement today to our members that we want them to vote for article 50.'Be he added: 'I fully understand the pressures and issues that members are under, those who represent leave constituencies and those who represent remain constituencies. 'Labour is in the almost unique position of having MPs representing constituencies in both directions and very strongly in both directions.'I say to everyone unite around the important issues of jobs, economy, security, rights, justice, those issues, and we will frame that relationship with Europe in the future, outside the Europebut in concert with friends, whether those countries are in the EU or outside the EU. 'That’s the message we’re putting out. And I’m asking all of our MPs not to block article 50 but to make sure it goes through next week.'
