 WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will press Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to Beijing next month to do more to rein in North Korea and to cease what Washington sees as unfair trade practices, a senior White House official said on Monday. Trump will also urge China to fully implement the U.N. Security Council's sanctions resolutions against Pyongyang and to take bilateral steps that go beyond that, the official told reporters ahead of Trump's Asia trip. The failure to confront and reverse the nuclear and missile threat from North Korea will lead to a "much darker era," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But the official also said Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution of the North Korea standoff. (Reporting By Steve Holland, Matt Spetalnick and Makini Brice; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
