EasyJet is powering ahead with a £10million Brexit plan to set up a base on the European mainland.The budget airline is establishing an operating company overseas to 'take control of its own destiny' and guarantee its flying rights when Britain leaves the European Union.The firm, which released its full-year results yesterday, has set aside £10million over the next two years to go towards setting up the base and re-registering aircraft in the region.         Tough year: Budget airline easyJet has suffered a 27.9 per cent drop in annual pretax profitsIt has been forced to take this action in order to get a European air operators' certificate that allows it to fly internal flights in Europe after Brexit.The move will secure the rights of the 30 per cent of its network that remains wholly within, and between, EU states, excluding the UK.

It is much better for EasyJet to control its own destiny.'   EasyJet posted a mixed set of results in the year ended September 30, saying it had remained 'resilient' despite terrorism and industrial action.Passenger numbers rose to record numbers, up 6.6 per cent from last year to 73.1million but profits in the period came in at £495million, down 27.8 per cent from the £686million it had posted the year before because of currency fluctuations.Sales also fell 0.4 per cent to £4.7billion as the airline cut fares.Severe disruption due to strikes, poor weather and runway closures at Gatwick resulted in 8,348 flights being either cancelled, delayed or diverted.McCall said terrorism had affected the company's profits by about £150million.She said: 'I think to be making half a billion pounds profit a year demonstrates how strong the airline is.'
