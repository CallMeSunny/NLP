Authorities looking for a teenager who spray-painted a 'prom-posal' on the side of an Idaho cliff have spoken to a group of girls that may include the message's intended target.In May the message 'Destiny, prom?' was painted in pink and blue letters between six and eight feet high on the side of the Black Cliffs in a popular rock climbing spot east of Boise, Idaho.Though a culprit has still not been found more than three months later, police are hopeful that the school year will bring new clues and have already spoken with more than twelve girls named Destiny.         A teenager is believed to have spray-painted this message - 'Destiny, prom?' - on the side of the Black Cliffs in Boise, Idaho and authorities have been trying to track down the culprit         The eight-foot-tall prom-posal was visible at the bottom of the cliffs at the popular climbing spot, though authorities have since painted over it'Our deputies interviewed over a dozen girls named "Destiny" and checked out other leads but weren't able to track it down,' Ada County Sheriff's Office spokesman Patrick Orr told KBOI.'We realize prom proposals are a big deal these days but this one was just a really bad - and illegal - idea, which caused some serious aesthetic and cultural damage,' the office wrote on its Facebook page in May.Police quickly began looking for the graffiti artist and worked with schools in the area to try to determine who was responsible, though progress has not netted a definitive suspect this summer.The person could face a misdemeanor charge of injury by graffiti, which is punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of $1,000. A federal charge also is possible because the US Bureau of Land Management owns the area, and the culprit also would be responsible for the cost of cleanup. Authorities have since painted over the graffiti.
