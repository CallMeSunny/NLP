H.K.'s Joshua Wong among 'world's greatest leaders': Fortune By Afp   Published: 12:05 BST, 27 March 2015  |  Updated: 12:05 BST, 27 March 2015                e-mail         Joshua Wong, the teenage face of Hong Kong's mass pro-democracy movement, once again challenged Chinese President Xi Jinping when he was named one of the world's 10 greatest leaders by Fortune magazine -- just a few spots behind the communist leader.Wong, who spearheaded mass street blockades which brought parts of the Asian financial centre to a standstill last year, sparked by restrictions from Beijing on how Hong Kong's next leader will be chosen, was 10th in Fortune's second annual "World's Greatest Leaders" list.Xi, by contrast, was ranked third.
