 Taiwan's defence ministry assured the public in a statement that it was able to fully monitor Chinese naval and air drills and 'take effective responsive measures to ensure defence security'.Chinese state broadcaster CCTV today released a 49-second of the drill through its social media account.The Chinese defence ministry confirmed in a statement Friday that it was the first time Su-35s flew over the Bashi Channel, hailing it as a 'new breakthrough, highlighting the new enhancements to the Air Force's combat capability'. China's J-11 fighters and early warning aircraft also took part in the drill.          It was the first time that China's supersonic Su-35 fighters (file photo) were sent over the Bashi         China's H-6K bombers have taken part in several drills over the Taiwan island in the past         China's fighter jets flew over two strategic channels, the Bashi Channel and the Miyako StraitThe highlight of the drill SU-35 is fitted with a 30mm cannon for air-to-air dog fighting as well as the capability of carrying rockets, missiles and bombs. Several cameras have been fitted to the aircraft in the video as it performs a range of high-energy manoeuvres. China bought 24 Sukhoi SU-35s from Russia in a £1.47 billion ($2 billion) landmark deal in 2015, reported Reuters.The Kremlin has delivered more than half of the order to Beijing by December, according to Chinese news site Sina.com. Russia claims the aircraft is better than the west's fourth-generation aircraft, such as the US F-16 and French Rafaele and even the RAF's Typhoon interceptor.                 In this April 18, 2018, photo provided by China's Xinhua News Agency, a Chinese armed helicopter assaults targets with rocket projectiles in a live-fire exercise off China's coastChina sees democratically governed Taiwan - which has never formally declared independence from the mainland - as a renegade part of its territory to be brought back into the fold, and has not ruled out reunification by force.Beijing has stepped up military patrols around Taiwan and used diplomatic pressure to isolate it internationally since President Tsai Ing-wen, of the traditionally pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, took office in 2016.Last month, China's air force said the series of operations were meant to 'strengthen its capacity to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity'. Defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian told a monthly press conference that they were 'directed against Taiwan independence forces and activities in the island'.Taiwan has accused Beijing of 'sabre rattling' and trying to stoke regional tensions with its recent spate of drills.Taipei has announced that it will practise thwarting a Chinese 'invasion' in annual live fire drills in June by simulating surprise coastal assaults.
