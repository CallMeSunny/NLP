China has sent troops out to the Horn of Africa to establish its first international military base.The ships set sail from the southern city of Zhanjiang, around 260 miles west of Hong Kong for the small African country of Djibouti on Tuesday. That move has some in the US military concerned - not just because it's China's first step towards international military power, but because the new base is located just four miles from US Camp Lemonnier.                 Ships (one pictured) carrying Chinese military personnel left for the country's first international military base in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa, on Tuesday          The ships left from Zhanjiang in southern China after this ceremony; they are bound for a new military installation in the African county of Djibouti       The base gives China access to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean - but it's also located just four miles from an existing US military installationSatellite photos from ImageSat International show buildings under construction at the massive base, including what appears to be an airstrip and hangars for planes. They also show how the base has increased dramatically in size between the start of April and the end of June. Construction on the base began in February 2016. The base was established under agreement between China and Djibouti after 'friendly negotiations, and accords with the common interest of the people from both sides,' Chinese state news agency Xinhua said.'The base will ensure China's performance of missions, such as escorting, peace-keeping and humanitarian aid in Africa and west Asia,' it claimed. It says the coastal base will be used to supply naval vessels taking part in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions off the coasts of Yemen and Somalia.It's certainly ideally located for China's interests, giving them a foothold in both the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, putting them in easy reach of the Middle East.           Satellite photos show details on the base such as an airstrip and hangars for aircraft. There are concerns as it is close to Camp Lemonnier, which has 3,000 US personnel and contractors         Construction on the base began in early 2016, and it has since developed into a full installation         The Chinese base is only four miles from Camp Lemonnier (pictured) in Djibouti. China and the US have been at loggerheads recently over international waters in the South China Sea         The Chinese base is only four miles from Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, which has led to concerns by some. China and the US have also been at loggerheads over international waters in the South China SeaBut the location of the base has disturbed those at Camp Lemonnier, also located in Djibouti, four miles from the Chinese base.One of the largest US military bases abroad, it is home to 3,000 military personnel and contractors.Marine General Thomas Waldhauser, commander of AFRICOM, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in March that he had concerns, Fox News reported.He said that he had met with Djibouti President Ismail Omar Guelleh 'and expressed our concerns about some of the things that are important to us about what the Chinese should not do at that location.'

 Waldhauser said he expected the base to be open in the summer; Xinhua has not said when it will become operational.The move comes as the US and China have continued to butt heads over the South China Sea.China claims the entire ocean - international waters and all - and has used artificial islands and military bases on naturally occurring islands to stake their claim.The US has for the past few years been sailing its ships through waters claimed by China - including those close to the island bases - to dispute that.              Djibouti President Ismail Omar Guelleh (left) and US Marine General Thomas Waldhauser (right) have had talks, Waldhauser said, about US concerns over the base and its useAlthough Djibouti is only 200 square miles bigger than New Jersey, it is home not just US and Chinese bases, but also to French and Japanese bases.It also agreed at the start of the year to allow Saudi Arabia to open a base on its land.China and Saudi have both supplied the country with money in recent years, with China alone putting in $14.4 billion in infrastructure projects, AFK Insider reported. The US, meanwhile, supplies around $3 million in food aid to the country each year.  Djibouti's position on the edge of the Indian Ocean has sparked concerns in India about the influence of military in the area.          A ceremony (pictured) was held before the Chinese ships departed. China says the base is just for use in supporting its ships on humanitarian and peacekeeping missions in the area
