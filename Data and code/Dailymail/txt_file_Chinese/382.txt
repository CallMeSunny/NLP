 Sun is the first serving member of the 25-person Politburo to be placed under investigation since Bo Xilai, who was jailed for life in 2013 in the wake of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign. Sun was once regarded as a possible successor to Xi Jinping, 64, who became the President of People's Republic of China in 2013, according to The Wall Street Journal which quoted people familiar with the matter.Xinhua's brief report did not say whether Sun would remain a member of the Politburo, the nation's top political body. Sun was removed from his position as the party chief in Chongqing on July 15, according to a previous Xinhua report. Chen Min'er, 56, was appointed as Sun's replacement on the same day.Chongqing is one of the four municipalities in China - alongside Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin - and is an industrial metropolis in the south-west of the country.

Bo Xilai (pictured) was also once the party chief in Chongqing before being investigated and later jailed for life. This photo taken on March 14, 2012, shows then Chongqing Party Secretary Bo Xilai during the closing ceremony of the National People's Congress         Bo was jailed for life in 2013 in the wake of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign.
