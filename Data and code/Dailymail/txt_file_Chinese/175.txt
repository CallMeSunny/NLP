 But fans are saying the nation's football bosses are spending their effort in the wrong direction. They say what the authority should focus is to train better players instead of cracking down on body art.The tattoo ban has apparently been imposed on all levels of national football teams in China and would be spread to the nation's football leagues, according to a report on Great Sports, a Shanghai-based sports news site.The report said that because national teams represent the best football skills of the country, they should set an example in promoting healthy culture and morals.  A report on 163.com said that the footballers' action during their game against Wales on March 22 was a clear indication that the Football Association of China had waged war on body art. The report said the authority was hoping the players to have a more positive and healthier image. Traditionally, tattoos are connected to the gang culture and are seen in a bad light in China. In ancient China, tattoo was a form of punishment on convicted criminals as a way to tell strangers that they had broken the law.However as China has been heavily influenced by the Western culture in the past 20 years or so, more and more public figures have resorted to body art to show their personality, including the nation's most famous homegrown footballers Zhang Linpeng, Wang Dalei and Wei Shihao.              Zhang Linpeng, one of China's most celebrated homegrown football players, has tattoos on both of his arms. The star would need to have them covered or removed if reports prove trueApparently, the ban issued by the Chinese football bosses has not gone down well among China's frustrated football fans, who have never seen their national team winning a single game in the World Cup.More than 87,000 people have commented on the news on 163.com. Many of them claimed that their football authority were spending effort in the wrong direction.One fan wrote: 'Would removing tattoos improve their football skills? What does it have to do with playing football?'Another reader said: 'As long as you are good at football, nobody would care if you get as many tattoos as David Beckham.'   This is not the first time Chinese footballers have been told to stop getting tattoos.Jia Xiuquan, the former head coach of China national under-20 football team, has famously said that he would not recruit any player who sports tattoos or hair-dye. In January, the Chinese government was said to have issued an order banning broadcasters from giving air time to artists with tattoos because are 'in conflict with the party's core values and morals'.
