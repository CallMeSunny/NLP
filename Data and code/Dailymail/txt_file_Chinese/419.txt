 According to Ms Zuo's post on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging platform, her pet dog, called Dou Dou, was found dead on June 11 after being transported by China Eastern Airline from Shenzhen to Wuhan.  Before she sent the three-year-old Golden Retriever to a pet logistic company to be sent to Wuhan on the night of June 10, it was 'full of life', according to her accounts.However, when her parents went to the Wuhan Tianhe International Airport to pick up the dog at 11:30am on June 11, the dog was found dead.The woman wrote under a screen name,Mo Xi Bao Bao. She said her late pet was transported by the China Eastern Airline on flight MU2478, which is a two-hour flight.She also posted two pictures which apparently showed a lifeless Dou Dou lying in a metal cage when it arrived at the airport. A few of the wires around Dou Dou's mouth had been torn.'I have never thought you would leave me like this,' the woman wrote.'I couldn't know how painful you had been before you died because the steel wires were gnawed away.'I'm sorry. I didn't look after you well.'         Another dog was shot dozens of times (pictured), also in Wuhan airport, while flying with the same airline after it escaped from the plane to the runway on May 24              The dog, called Er Mao, is undergoing treatment, according to the owner's social media account. The owner said vets had removed around 20 bullets after two operations         Er Mao's owner shared her horrifying experience on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging platform. The post has been shared over 132,000 times and received 53,060 commentsMs Zuo said her parents waited at the airport for three hours but staff from China Eastern Airline failed to give them an explanation. Ms Zuo's parents were apparently told that the dog had already been dead when they opened the gate of the cargo compartment. China Eastern Airline agreed to compensate Ms Zuo for her dead dog, but only according to the financial standard of lost luggage, as it is reported.The woman, still furious, told Thecover.cn: 'They told me that the compensation will be based on the standard set for luggage, meaning that they can only pay me 100 yuan (£11.5) per kilogram.'My dog is 35 kilograms, so they intend to give me 3,500 yuan (£403) in compensation. This is emotionally unacceptable to me, as my dog was like my child.' In another post on June 14, Ms Zuo said China Eastern Airline had apologised to her, but she did not mention if the company had adjusted the amount of compensation.A customer service officer from China Eastern Airline told MailOnline that the company is yet to issue an official statement regarding the matter.  The officer said the incident is still being looked into by relevant colleagues.         China Eastern Airline told MailOnline that the company is investigating both incidents In May, another dog owner who also flew with China Eastern Airline claimed that his dog was shot dozens of times because it had escaped onto the runway.In a Weibo post on May 27, the owner claimed that he flew from Shanghai to Wuhan on flight MU 2544 on May 24 and he checked in his Golden Retriever, called Er Mao, as luggage.  But when he arrived in Wuhan, he was told by staff that Er Mao had gone missing.Later, he was told given a heavily wounded and dying dog. He was told that his dog had escaped while being unloaded from the plane.According to accounts, airline staff failed to catch the dog on the runway and the animals was wounded as workers from the airport tried to bring it under control.The dog was later reported to be shot by air guns for over 50 times.          The two incidents took place in Wuhan Tianhe International Airport (pictured) in HubeiWuhan Tianhe International Airport confirmed the incident had happened in a statement. The airport said that China Eastern Airline resorted them for help on May 24 after failing to catch an escaped dog on the runway. The airport sent eight officers to find the dog. The statement also said that the dog, which was one-metre-tall (three feet), was terrified and hard to reach. As a result, officers 'brought it under control', according to rules issued by the Civil Aviation Bureau of China.According to a post from its owner on June 12, vets had removed nearly 20 bullets from Er Mao after two operations. It's understood that Er Mao is still undergoing treatment.Commenting on the matter, a customer service officer from China Eastern Airline told MailOnline that the company is still carrying out investigation.
