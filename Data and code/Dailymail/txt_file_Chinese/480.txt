Chinese president Xi Jinping has pleaded for peace after Donald Trump warned the US is sending a powerful 'armada' to North Korea.The two leaders have spoken by phone in an apparent effort to avoid further escalation after Trump deployed the aircraft carrier-led strike group in a show of force to the Korean peninsula. The US president last night repeatedly accused Kim Jong-Un of doing 'the wrong thing'  as he talked up the power of the fleet heading towards the Korean peninsula.  China has made clear its frustration with Pyongyang's stubbornness but Beijing's priority remains preventing any military flare-up that could bring chaos and instability to its doorstep.In his phone call with Trump, Xi stressed that China 'advocates resolving the issue through peaceful means,' the foreign ministry said.China is said to have moved 150,000 troops to its border to deal with a possible influx of North Korean refugees amid fears Trump may strike Kim Jong-un following the surprise US missile attack on Syria last week.          'We are sending an armada. Very powerful,' Trump told Fox News on Tuesday amid rising tensions with North Korea         TENSE STAND-OFF: The U.S. dispatched a naval strike group to the area amid continued missile launches and hot rhetoric from North Korea         Chinese president Xi Jinping (right) has pleaded for peace after Donald Trump (left) warned the US is sending an 'armada' to North KoreaAsked in an interview with Fox News whether he considers Kim Jong-Un to be mentally fit, Trump said: 'I don't know.

Very powerful,' Trump said. 'We have submarines. Very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier, that I can tell you. And we have the best military people on earth. And I will say this: He is doing the wrong thing.'    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       We'll nuke you! North Korea state media warns of a nuclear...

 Asked what his administration was doing right now on North Korea, Trump responded: 'You never know, do you? You never know.''That's all you're going to say?' Bartiromo asked. 'You know I don't talk about the military,' Trump responded. In the same interview, Trump also said Russian President Vladimir Putin is backing an 'evil person' in Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.'Frankly, Putin is backing a person that's truly an evil person," Trump told the Fox Business Network, referring to Assad. 'I think it's very bad for Russia. I think it's very bad for mankind.'Of Assad, Trump added: 'This is an animal.' Trump is increasing pressure on Putin to abandon Assad, just as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is visiting Moscow.Tillerson is currently in Moscow, meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

'If not, we will solve the problem without them!'Tension mounted amid concern North Korea might conduct its sixth nuclear test.In a show of force, the U.S. is diverting U.S. Navy strike group Carl Vinson from Australia toward the Korean peninsula. North Korea has continued to blast the U.S. in its pronouncements. Its ministry of foreign affairs called the deployment 'reckless acts of aggression' in a letter delivered to CNN in in Pyongyang: 'If the U.S. dares to choose a military option … the DPRK is willing and ready to react to any mode of war desired by the U.S.'Our revolutionary strong army is keenly watching every move by enemy elements with our nuclear sight focused on the U.S. invasionary bases not only in South Korea and the Pacific operation theatre but also in the U.S. mainland,' said the country's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper.         The Chinese army has deployed 150,000 troops to the Yalu River Bridge at the North Korean border in anticipation of a wave of refugees from North Korea if war breaks out. Meanwhile, the US Navy has moved the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group from Singapore to the North Korean peninsula         War games: Pyongyang condemned Washington's order to dispatch the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and its battle group to the region for US-South Korea military exercises.
