 Grindr, which bills itself as 'the world's largest social networking app for gay, bi, trans and queer people,' was founded in 2009 and says it has millions of users worldwide.US officials feared that people with American security clearances who use the app could be blackmailed if China's government demanded user data from Kunlun Tech, The Wall Street Journal reported in March, citing unnamed sources.China has previously announced a strategy of achieving global dominance in high-tech fields like artificial intelligence and use of Big Data.But that has raised US objections over Chinese state support for its tech players, as well as fears of advanced cyber-espionage by China.                 President Donald Trump (right) expanded his tariff regime to include practically everything China exports to the US; Chinese President Xi Jinping (left) retaliated Monday but said his own tariffs won't go into effect until June. The pair are pictured in November 2017        China announced Monday it would raise tariffs on $60 billion in US exports by next month, responding in kind to President Donald Trump's decision last week to hike duties on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese merchandiseThe Chinese company was ordered to divest itself of Grindr by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign investments in sensitive industries or those deemed harmful to US national security.Kunlun Tech's exchange filing, submitted on Monday, said it signed an agreement on May 9 with US authorities regarding the sale.The agreement restricts Kunlun Tech from accessing some of Grindr's user information and from transferring sensitive data to people or entities within China.Grindr is also required to stop all operations in China and must get CFIUS approval for three of its board members. In addition, one board must be an American citizen with US security clearance.
