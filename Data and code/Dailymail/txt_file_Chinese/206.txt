An electric Range Rover Sport has climbed its own stairway to Heaven to become the first off-roader to ascend the death-defyingly steep 99 hairpin turns and 999-steps of one of China’s most revered national landmarks.A far cry from the school run, the showroom-standard five-seater British P400e plug-in hybrid 4X4 became the first SUV in the world to make the epic ascent to the top of the ‘Heaven’s Gate’ steps in Hunan Province at the climax of tackling one of China’s and the world’s most challenging and twisting highways.The challenge began at the bottom of the legendary serpentine seven-mile Tianmen Mountain Road - known as the Dragon Road – with 99 treacherous hair-pin bends snaking like a dragon’s tail.Scroll down for video          Tackling one on China's most treacherous routes: The road winding up Tianmen Mountain consists of 99 hairpin bendsThe epic finale was climbing the 45-degree angle staircase of 999 steps leading from the road the peak of China’s legendary Heaven’s Gate natural rock arch using a combination of petrol and electric battery power.The epic climb – achieved in under 23 minutes - was made by Panasonic Jaguar Formula-E electric car racing driver and test driver Ho-Pin Tung behind the wheel of a Range Rover Sport PHEV petrol-electric SUV.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 2 Next       Rodent-riddled Ferrari 275 GTB and Shelby Cobra worth...

     But as he emerged through mountain mist to land victorious on the the top of the peak after navigating the 99 hair-pin bends on the road plus the 999 steps to the summit of Heaven’s Gate in a total of 22 minutes and 41 seconds, he said: ’I’m still shaking. The adrenalin is something I’ve never experienced before. The mountain very generously gave us one shot to make it up here.’He added: ‘I’ve experienced Formula E, Formula 1 and won at the 24 Hours of Le Mans but this was without doubt one of the most demanding driving challenges I’ve ever faced. ‘The Range Rover Sport PHEV performed brilliantly as it inspired real confidence on the mountain road and climbed the stairs up to Heaven’s Gate effortlessly.’         Before the Range Rover and its driver attempted the challenge, Chinese officials had warned Land Rover staff that: ‘If he crashes, he will die’         Tianmen Mountain is a mountain located within Tianmen Mountain National Park, Zhangjiajie, in the northwestern part of Hunan Province, China         Official figures say the mountain is 1,518.6 metres - or 4,982 feet - highHe said he combination of the petrol engine and electric motor helped make short work of the road section of the challenge before showing its uncompromised all-terrain credentials by climbing the steep staircase to the natural rock arch.Once at the end of the hair-pin road section, the driver set the Range Rover Sport’s Terrain Response system in dynamic mode to tackle the steep 999-step second stage of the challenge to conquer Heaven’s Gate.Trying to navigate the steps in an enormous two-tonne off-roader with nothing but a view of the 432-foot Tianmen cave - the natural hole in the mountain - and the sky sounds like a fairly unenviable task to us.
