 Realising that the little boy could slip through the grille at any moment, a brave 60-year-old onlooker transformed into a real-life superhero and started a dramatic rescue.The boy was seen trying to pull himself up but failed, leaving him swaying dangerously from side to side. Concerned onlookers quickly grabbed a large bed sheet and situated it below the child in case he fell. Emergency services were immediately alerted.  Several other neighbours rushed to the flat where the boy was living, but they could not open the locked door. Liu Xingzhao was at home in the next block when he heard the commotion outside and was shocked to see the two-year-old dangling in mid-air.
