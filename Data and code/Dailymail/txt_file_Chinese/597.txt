A group of 49 sinkholes have been discovered in the Qinling mountains in north-west China, according to Chinese state media. Experts believe this is the world's biggest sinkhole cluster.The caverns, located between 32 and 33 degrees north latitude, are situated in the northernmost karst landform region ever found in the world, said Chinese experts.Occupying an area of around 600 square kilometers (230 square miles), the group comprise one 'super large' sinkhole, 17 'large' sinkhole and 31 'conventional' sinkholes.                Mysterious: A group of 49 sinkholes have been discovered in the Qinling mountains in China         A video released by CCTV News revealed what is inside the Hanzhong sinkholes (pictured)         The caverns are situated in the northernmost karst landform region ever found in the world   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       'The most stubborn shop': Grocery store in China is left in...

This means the ecological system inside the caverns remains almost intactWang Weihua, the head of Shaanxi's land resources department, said experts had carried out inspection in the area for about four months.A total of 5,000 square kilometers (1,930 square miles) had been explored through various research methods, including infrared measurement and drone surveys. Footage released by CCTV News revealed the ecological diversity inside the sinkholes.In addition to the 49 sinkholes, 50 funnels measuring 50 metres to 100 metres (164 to 328 miles) wide as well as 50 caves were found. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HANZHONG SINKHOLES?   The sinkholes were situated in a remote area rarely touched by human beings. This means the ecological system inside the caverns remains almost intact.Comprising different geological features, such as dried valleys and caves, the sinkhole group can help experts understand the evolution of subterranean rivers and the ancient environment in the south of Qinling Mountains.They also act as valuable material for the research on the formation of the Hanzhong basin and cave canyon. Department of Land Resources of Shaanxi Province   A Chinese geologist told China Daily that the scientific value of Hanzhong sinkholes was unmatched.Zhang Yuanhai, a senior engineer with Institute of Karst Geology under Chinese Academy of Geological Science, told a reporter from the state-run English newspaper that the sinkholes were 'the first geological landscape found in the most north boundary of the humid tropical and subtropical Karst landform area, which has exceeded expectations of all geologists'. The provincial government of Shaanxi said they would develop a 'systematic, scientific and specific' plan to protect the sinkhole group. A research station is due to be set up to further study the caverns, which have been dubbed 'the gift from the earth and the wonder of the world' by the local authority.
