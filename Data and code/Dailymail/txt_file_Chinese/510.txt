From there, the merchandise was shipped to Hong Kong and subsequently marketed in China.'The investigation determined that the Spanish company had orchestrated a formula to try to evade their criminal responsibilities by associating with well-known Greek entrepreneurs to create a screen-fabric company,' said police. 'The profits were staggering - about €7,000 per kilogram of eel in China.' There are strict rules in place over the fishing and sale of the baby eels, which are in danger of being wiped out.
