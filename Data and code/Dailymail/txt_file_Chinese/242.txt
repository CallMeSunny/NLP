 The baby, whose name is unknown, is now being kept in the city's LA East District 153 Hospital.Doctors are monitoring him to see whether regular circulation returns, in which case the toe could be saved.        TOE TOURNIQUET SYNDROME: FACTS  Toe tourniquet syndrome is a medical condition where a hair or thread becomes tightly tied to a finger, toe or other appendage cutting off circulation and potentially causing amputation.The problem usually affects young babies when hair ends up in their socks and is most common when mothers are shedding hair post-pregnancy.It is identified with magnification and cut away usually with small scissors, the rare condition is missed by some doctors.  The baby's father said his wife has not been home in recent days because she is looking after her own father who has been hospitalised following a heart attack.The task of taking care of the baby and his year-old sister has therefore fallen on his shoulders.   Doctors have repeatedly warned about the hidden danger to newborns' toes and fingers from stray hairs, especially for post-pregnant women suffering from hair loss.A single strand of hair can wrap itself around a child's toe, cutting off circulation and potentially leading to amputation.Called 'toe tourniquet syndrome', it can affect all appendages, such as fingers, penises and ear lobes.Cases are deemed rare. Figures suggest there are around 60 instances of the bizarre syndrome in the UK each year.Most children who suffer from toe tourniquet syndrome are four days to 19 months old and usually present to doctors in obvious distress. The hair is wrapped around the digit by a repetitive movement of the appendage in a confined area such as hands in mittens or feet and legs in pyjamas.
