 Jiang Jingzhi and Jiang Zhihui were born in June, 2015, in Yulin, southern China's Guangxi Province. The twins were born prematurely at 33 weeks and were diagnosed with various diseases at birth, including purulent meningitis and neonatal sepsis, according to their father. Shortly after their birth, both of the babies suffered from hydrocephalus and their heads kept growing. In order to treat the disease, Jingzhi and Zhihui's parents spent around 70,000 yuan (£8,000) in the space of two weeks. They had to take the boys home in September, 2015, because they could no longer afford the medical bills.In a small rented flat in Yulin, Jiang Laicai and his wife looked after the babies by themselves, but the twins' health quickly deteriorated.         Mr Jiang, his babies, his parents and his sister live together in a small rented room in Yulin         Mr Jiang, a former construction worker, is doing menial jobs so he could support his familyMr Jiang said he had tried to take them to other hospitals in Yulin, but the doctors said they couldn't treat the boys and even told Mr Jiang to give up hope. As the boys' heads kept ballooning, their mother couldn't cope with the stress of life anymore.She left the twins as well as Mr Jiang and moved back to live with her mother. Mr Jiang said: 'I don't want to blame her. 'But I would not give up. I would find ways to treat my baby boys.'The father, who was a construction worker, is now doing any menial jobs he can find to support his family.After his wife left, he asked his parents and sister to move in with him so that they could take turns to look after his ill children.          Volunteers have helped the father set up a fund-raising page online and many people donated         Mr Jiang said he would bring his sons to Shanghai to be treated thanks to the donationsMr Jiang said he had contacted a hospital in Shanghai, the Shanghai Children's Hospital, which agreed to treat the twins through operations.However, the treatment would cost 700,000 yuan (£80,000), which Mr Jiang couldn't afford. Jiang Jingzhi and Jiang Zhihui's story was noticed by a group of local volunteers, who helped their family set up a fund-raising page online on June 19.So far, the family have received 366,345 yuan (£41,664), about half of the cost needed.Mr Jiang said with the help of the donations, he would take Jiangzhi and Zhihui to Shanghai on July 20 to start their treatment. The man said he was confident that he could find a way to carry on with the operations 'no matter how hard it is'.   WHAT IS HYDROCEPHALUS?  Hydrocephalus is a build-up of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. The excess fluid leads to increased pressure on the brain which can cause damage to the brain tissue. The main symptoms of hydrocephalus are: headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion and problems with vision (for example, blurred or double vision).The key treatment for hydrocephalus is a shunt.This is a thin tube implanted in the brain to drain away the excess CSF to another part of the body (often the abdominal cavity, the space around the bowel) where it can be absorbed into the bloodstream. If left untreated, it carries the risk of long-term mental and physical disabilities as a result of permanent brain damage and can be fatal.
