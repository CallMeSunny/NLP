 Strapped into their safety harnesses and wearing blue hard hats, the engineers are seen walking on wires no thicker than bottle caps with only a thin line on either side to hold on to.One engineer, Liu Jihong, whose team maintains the power grid in the southern part of Hebei province, told People's Daily the team scales the 70-metre-tall towers at least 10 times every month.'We make sure hundreds of thousands of families across Hebei's six cities have a reliable electricity supply,' he said.

'Every time I climb back down from the tower, I would call my wife to tell her I'm safe,' Liu said         In January, villages in south-west China's Chongqing Municipality started deploying drones equipped with a flamethrower to clean garbage on the overhead powerlines'However, the drone is able to solve the problem safely without the need for an outage,' he said.The drone is equipped with a fuel tank, oil pump, automatic ignition device and a flamethrower.'For ordinary plastic bags or kites, it only takes around 10 seconds to eliminate the waste. But for canvas, banners or tree branches, it could take up to 30 seconds. Burning off a honeycomb will take the longest - around 10 minutes,' He said, adding that the wires will not be damaged due to precise operation of the done.
