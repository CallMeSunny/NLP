 Released by China's central propaganda department on January 1, the app is called 'Study (Xi) Strong Country' (学习强国), which is a witty wordplay as President Xi's family name can also mean 'study' in Chinese.Along with the mobile software, a website of the same name was also launched. According to Beijing-based statistical consulting firm Qimai, 'Study (Xi) Strong Country' has topped the download chart for free apps for both iOS and Android systems in China.It has been the most popular free iPhone apps since its release nearly seven weeks ago, according to figures from Qimai. The second and third place have been video app Douying, known in the west as TikTok, and Chinese podcast app Ximalaya.  Apparently, the huge success of the app, which is rated just 2.7 out of 5 on mobile analytics site App Annie, isn't because of how advanced or useful it is, but due to an alleged order from the Communist Party of China to its nearly 90 million members.         Along with the mobile software, a website of the same name was also launched on January 1         A chart released by statistical consulting firm Qimai shows 'Study (Xi) Strong Country' (green) topping the download chart for free iPhone apps for more than a month while video app Douyin (red) and podcast app Ximalaya take the second and third spotIt is reported that the ruling party has required its members to download the app and use it on a daily basis, reported BBC. Some non-party members, such as workers at state-owned companies and public school teachers, have also been told to do so, according to the same report.  The Communist app has also been billed as the modern-day equivalent to the 'Little Red Book', a pocket-sized booklet with Chairman Mao's philosophy and a must-have item for Chinese people in the 1960s and 1970s.               The app has also been billed as the modern-day equivalent to the 'Little Red Book' (right), a booklet with Chairman Mao's (left) philosophy and a must-have item in China in the 1970sIt is estimated that more than one billion copies of Chairman Mao's 'Little Red Book' were circulated during China's Cultural Revolution, making it the second-most printed book in the world after the Bible.   Xi Jinping has been widely considered as China's most powerful leader since the nation's founding father Chairman Mao who ruled from 1949 to 1976.Xi could potentially rule China for life after Chinese lawmakers in March last year abolished presidential term limits that had been in place for more than 35 years.Last year, Xi was named by Forbes as the most powerful person on Earth, ending Putin's four-year reign at the top and pushing Trump down to the third.
