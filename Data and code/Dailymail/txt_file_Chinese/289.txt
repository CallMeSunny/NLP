Children waving American flags greet the Trumps as they arrive at the Beijing airport         President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrived on Air Force One in Beijing, China on Wednesday         Trump left Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, South Korea on his way to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping to talk about global trade and the North Korean nuclear menace         A U.S. and Chinese honor guard met the Trumps, along with a cadre of schoolchildren waving the flags of both nations       Chinese officials rolled a large set of stairs to the aircraft's door on Wednesday, avoiding any appearance of the kind of insult that greeted former president Barack Obama in 2016       Obama was denied use of an airport staircase when he deplaned Air Force One last September as he arrived in China for the annual Group of 20 summit – a move that was seen globally as a major snubThe Forbidden City, now a major tourist attraction, has its roots in the 15th Century and was the Chinese imperial palace from the Ming dynasty through 1912. Trump left South Korea on Wednesday after delivering a speech to the country's National Assembly. He said in a tweet Wednesday morning that he was looking forward to again seeing Xi, 'who is just off his great political victory.' Beijing is the third destination on a five-nation hustle across eastern Asia. As with every major country on the trip, North Korea was expected to dominate Trump and Xi's discussions. Trump said Monday in Japan that he would also raise China's 'unfair' trade practices with Xi.          Trump tweeted Wednesday that he was looking forward to renewing his bond with Xi, whom he welcomed to his Florida Mar-a-Lago private resort in April       Trump roared with approval as he waded through a sea of children on the tarmac Wednesday in China       Trump singled out China on Tuesday in South Korea as a country that needs to do more to cripple North Korea's nuclear aggression        Since his an April summit with Xi at Mar-a-Lago the U.S. president has backed off a verbal assault on China for trade imbalances.'The relationship developed by President Xi and myself I think is outstanding,' Trump said after less than a day of talks with the Chinese president and his representatives. 'We look forward to being together many times in the future. And I believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away.'Days later Trump was still gushing about his weekend in Florida with Xi in what amounted to a total about-face of his previous criticisms.'Now what am I going to do? Start a trade war with China while in the middle of him working on a bigger problem, frankly, with North Korea?' he asked rhetorically in an interview with Fox & Friends. 'We lose with almost every country, we have massive deficits,' the billionaire president insisted. 'We can't allow the world to look at us as a whipping post. Not gonna happen, anymore.'Monday, at a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo, Trump told a reporter who asked how his administration plans to enforce its mandate of a 'free and open' Indo-Asia Pacific without riling up China, a major power on the continent, that he would not allow the communist country to take advantage of the U.S.'You will be seeing things of countries that have been treating the United States and the United States worker and companies...our country, and our workers very unfairly, you will be seeing that the United States will take very, very strong action,' Trump said.  Trump has been hesitant to strongarm Beijing so long as Xi goes along with his plans to suffocate North Korea's nuclear ambition.But a U.S. official told reporters during a Sunday evening in Tokyo that the United States would not allow any country to railroad it on the interest of security cooperation.'The United States isn't going to barter away our interests on the trade front in order to make gains doing what the entire world has, more or less, obligated itself to do, and that is to contain and confront the threat from North Korea,' the official said.
