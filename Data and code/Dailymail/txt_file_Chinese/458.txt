It has been said to rival America's F-35 fighter jet.China's improved J-31 is poised to be the nation's stealth fighter for aircraft carriers and would ultimately take the place of the current single-engine J-10s.Developed by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC), the twin-engine J-31 is similar in size to the F-35, has a range of 775 miles, can transport up to 28 tons and is able to reach Mach 1.8 speeds.Scroll down for video          China's improved J-31 is poised to be the nation's stealth fighter for aircraft carriers and would ultimately take the place of the single-engine J-10s that are currently used in battle. The craft has been spending more time in flight tests - suggesting it could soon be put into action WHAT ARE THE FEATURES?   Developed by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC), the twin-engine J-31 is similar in size to the F-35, with a range of 775 miles, can carry up to 28 tons and is able to reach Mach 1.8 speeds. SAC foresees its craft ultimately replacing the J-10s and the firm may market the J-31 to other nations that are barred from purchasing America's F-35. The craft boasts an IRST sensor, stealth capabilities, better radar technology and cleaner burner engines.The team also went as far as to replace the WS-13 engines with domestic WS-13E or WS-17 turbofan engines that give it more speed.  China ranks second in the world's military budget, with $145.8 billion dollars, and it seems the Asian country is looking to use a good portion of its funding to modernize its artillery.Reports have suggested that the Chines People's Liberation Army currently has approximately 2,200 operational aircraft – but only 600 of which are considered modern.China first showed-off the J-31 in 2014 at an airshow, which it rose in a nearly vertical climb on take-off in Zhuhai before circling back and doing two rolls.The fighter's Chinese name is 'Falcon Eagle' and it is manufactured by a unit of Aviation Industry Corp. of China (AVIC), whose defense arm uses the slogan: 'We are making the best weapons for guardians of the peace.'But the plane's first public appearance came at a time when tensions were high between China and its neighbors over territorial disputes, particularly Japan which has feuded with Beijing over a group of islands in the East China Sea.SAC foresees its craft ultimately replacing the J-10s and the firm may market the J-31 to other nations that are barred from purchasing America's F-35.           RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Never cross a cuttlefish: Researchers film vicious battle...

          Developed by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC), the twin-engine J-31 is similar in size to the F-35, with a range of 775 miles, can carry up to 28 tons and is able to reach Mach 1.8 speeds. This is the second version of the prototype the firm has developed However, getting to a point where China is ramping up flight tests was a long journey.According to Jeffrey Lin and P.W. Singer with Popular Science, the first variant of J-31 was not equipped with cutting-edge technology.         The firm gave the prototype another go in December 2016 and this time, the plane was heavier and longer than its predecessor. In addition to size, the craft was fitted with an IRST sensor, stealth capabilities, better radar technology and cleaner burner engines (concept drawing)It 'did not fly with advanced avionics like an infrared search and track (IRST) sensor and stealth features like swept vertical stabilizers, suggesting its role to be a proof of concept for testing SAC's stealth technology, and hopefully attract buyers,' they reported.And when SAC attempted to market the plane as 'an export fifth generation fighter' it feel short among both national and international buyers.  AMERICA'S F-35 IN FIGURES          Role: Stealth multirole fighterFirst flight: December 15, 2006Unit cost (not including engine):F-35A - $98millionF-35B - $104millionF-35C - $116millionNumber built: 115 (as of November 2014)Length: 51ft (15.67m)Wingspan: 35ft (10.7m)Height: 14ft (4.33m)Max speed (F-35A): 1199mph  (1,930kph)   The firm gave the prototype another go in December 2016 and this time, the plane was heavier and longer than its predecessor.In addition to size, the craft was fitted with an IRST sensor, stealth capabilities, better radar technology and cleaner burner engines.         In addition to size, the craft was fitted with an IRST sensor, stealth capabilities, better radar technology and cleaner burner engines (concept drawing)The team also went as far as to replace the WS-13 engines with domestic WS-13E or WS-17 turbofan engines that give it more speed.Now, the J-31 is about the same size as the F-35, has a range of 775 miles, is strong enough to carry up to 28 tons and reaches Mach 1.8 speeds.Lin and Singer noted that 'the combination of the J-31's high speed performance, and suggested payload of 6 PL-12 or 4 PL-21 long range air to air missiles suggests that the J-31 has been optimized as an air superiority fighter'.         China first showed-off the J-31 in 2014 (pictured) at an airshow. But  fells short because it 'did not fly with advanced avionics and stealth features, suggesting its role to be a proof of concept for testing SAC's stealth technology, and hopefully attract buyers'
