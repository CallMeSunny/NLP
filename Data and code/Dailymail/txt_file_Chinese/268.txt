As if we hadn't seen enough of Alessandra Ambrosio's endless legs this week, what with the wondrous display that was the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, here, the veteran supermodel made ANOTHER dazzling appearance clad in Balmain. Hanging off the arms of fellow models as well as the brand's Creative Director Olivier Rousteing, Alessandra made quite the entrance. 
 
The dress itself hails from Balmain's Spring '18 collection, which is not yet available to shop, however we've collated a selection of similar options for you to shop below. 
 
We love the mesh detail of Alesandra's dress, which ha been a big hit trend-wise for the past couple of years. Looks like this is a trend that isn't going anywhere either, which bodes well seeing as we've got out eye on Missguided's premium black bandage dress for the upcoming party season. 
 
Or perhaps you're after something slightly more demaure? Fear not. AX Paris have just what you're looking for. With its high neck and sheer sleeves, this one strikes a great balance: think party dress meets high fashion.
