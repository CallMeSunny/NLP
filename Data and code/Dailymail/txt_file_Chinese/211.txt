 Local news outlets said the minian, carrying a handful of passengers, struck five to six people waiting for a light change at a busy pedestrian crossing before mounting the pavement.Graphic images from the scene show two women pinned between the front of the van and a tree outside the Starbucks where the vehicle crashed.Videos on social media showed several others lying unconscious on the pavement as firefighters trying to extinguish a blaze inside the van.                Emergency: Firemen are seen putting out the blaze, which was caused by the driver smoking in the van and accidentally igniting gas tubes in the back           Shocking: At least 18 people were injured, with three currently in a serious condition A Shanghai police statement said a preliminary investigation indicated that the driver of the van, a 40-year-old man who was among the injured, had been smoking at the wheel which apparently ignited 'dangerous substances' inside the vehicle.The driver has been identified by his surname Chen, a metal worker from Jiangxi Province in south-east China who does not have a criminal record.Chen is currently in hospital and has reportedly been charged with dangerous driving and illegal transport of dangerous substances.    Zhang Sai, a security guard at an adjacent building, told AFP the van was on fire when it veered out of control and mounted the curb, striking pedestrians and sending others scurrying to get out of the way.'It happened around 8.50am (12.50am GMT). The van was on fire before it crashed on the sidewalk,' Zhang said.         The incident took place just ten minutes before British Prime Minister Theresa May gave this speech at the China-UK business forum in Shanghai       The minivan struck the pedestrians on a footpath in downtown Shanghai Friday afternoon         Photos show the van bursting into flames as it is embanked on the pavement (pictured)A man who witnessed the crash on his way to People's Park said in a video interview carried by Chinese media outlets that the minivan seemed to be moving fast as it veered across the road.'The minivan did not slow down. The driver must have been in a panic at the time. He didn't slow down and just directly crashed,' said the witness, who wasn't identified. 'It was on the other side of the road and made a turn over to this side. People saw it and quickly tried to get away but a lot of people were still hit.'The man said people cracked open the windows of the vehicle trying to rescue passengers.Xu Xin, a 23-year-old restaurant employee, came upon the immediate aftermath during his morning jog to find injured people on the ground and bystanders calling emergency services.Portable gas tanks that are often used to fuel stoves were inside the vehicle, he said.          Witnesses told The People's Daily newspaper the fire had since extinguished and that there were gas canisters in the van       Quick clean: Emergency services soon cleared up the scene of the accident, while a few police officers remained outside during the day       'The fire department carried gas tanks from the van, like those used in restaurants,' Xu said. He added that the driver seemed unconscious while two other people in the van were badly burned. Emergency services quickly cleared up the scene of the incident, while a small police presence remained on hand standing watch. Damage to the fencing outside the Starbucks could be seen a few hours after the incident, but otherwise there was little evidence of it taking place. The coffee shop remained locked up on Friday afternoon, and a notice was taped to the door saying it had been closed, advising customers to go to other nearby outlets.In 2013, two tourists were killed when a car rammed into bystanders on Beijing's iconic Tiananmen Square before bursting into flames.Three attackers also died in the incident, which Beijing blamed on separatists from the restive western region of Xinjiang.
