Share this article Share   'This is an encouraging first step towards meeting our return on tangible equity target of more than 11 per cent by 2020.'Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, commented: 'These are generally – and typically - strong numbers from HSBC, but they come with a tinge of disappointment.         A 'tough fourth quarter' took its toll on HSBC'A tough fourth quarter took its toll on some of the numbers, whilst a slowing Chinese economy, partially fuelled by the ongoing trade spat with the US, has yet fully to wash through.'In all, the figures are strong, but not quite strong enough to allay concerns which have tended to overhang the sector as a whole.'The shares have suffered a 13 per cent decline over the last year, as compared to a dip of just 0.4 per cent for the wider FTSE100, and whilst the bank remains a behemoth within global banking, it is also a strategic work in progress. 'As such, the market consensus of the shares as a hold is likely to remain in place until some of the planned growth comes through in earnest,' Hunter added.
