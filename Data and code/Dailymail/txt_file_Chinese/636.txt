 In a commentary posted on October 15, the People's Daily newspaper said emojis and stickers in apps 'should be regulated'.The state-run newspaper claimed that some of the stickers and emojis contained 'erotic, violent and negative' content. It also claimed that some of the stickers can be confusing to those who are learning Chinese. WeChat, a popular Chinese messaging app has many sticker sets and emojis that are shared and downloaded every day. A total of 20 million stickers are downloaded on a daily basis.  A spokeswoman for WeChat told Sixth Tone that the company has a system for ensuring the content of the stickers does not break any rules. She said: 'The stickers that are submitted to WeChat are examined through manual review to ensure their compliance with national policy and our platform's operating rules.'          A woman posts pictures to WeChat on her mobile phone (File photo)          A woman uses her smart phone (File photo) Many people on news site Sina have been sharing their anger at the commentary piece. One user wrote: 'The officials are just too free and they want to find something else to do.' While another commented: 'What's the point of regulating such trivial stuff?' And one said: 'Netizens can create their own emoji now. We can screen capture whatever we like every minute and p*** you off.'  China is continuing to crack down on its internet. In April, the Ministry of Culture announced that it would be investigating live-streaming sites. While in August, TV shows that glamorise western lifestyles and show cleavage were banned.
