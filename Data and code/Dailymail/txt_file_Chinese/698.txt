              Demystified: The remarkable phenomenon is created by the growth of a variety of algal bloom called Noctiluca scintillans         Breath-taking: The spectacle is also called 'sea ghost' as its colours are vivid at night, luring visitors to the glowing seasideNoctiluca is a type of single-cell animal that eats plankton and is eaten by other species. The organisms multiply when nitrogen and phosphorous from farm run-off increase.The spectacle has earned the name 'sea ghost' as its colours are especially vivid at night, luring local photographers to capture the glowing seaside. The phenomenon is not uncommon on the Chinese coastline. Glow-in-the-dark beaches have been observed in several different cities since the beginning of this year, including eastern China's Dalian city in April and southern China's Shenzhen city in May.  MYSTERY OF THE STUNNING GLOW: HOW IS THE 'SEA GHOST' EFFECT CREATED?Noctiluca scintillans is a free-living, non, marine-dwelling species of that exhibits luminescence when it is disturbed in its large population.Each micro algae is made up of a wide flagellum, an extension of the cell wall called a tooth, and a striated tentacle involved in ingestion.The Noctiluca become more abundant when the chemicals nitrogen and phosphorous from farm run-off increase and pour into the oceans.Unlike similar organisms in its genus, Noctiluca doesn't directly produce chemicals that can attack the nervous system or parts of the body.When the blooms die, they sink to the bottom of the sea when they decompose, consuming huge amounts of oxygen - killing other marine life.Source: Smithsonian Department of Botany            more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  MP Charles Walker says 'ITV should stop making Jeremy Kyle Show'       Watch video  Nigel Farage defends where Brexit Party funding is coming from       Watch video  Student snatches the weave off his substitute teacher in AL       Watch video  Felicity Huffman arrives to court and is expected to plead guilty           Watch video  Lorry swerves into car in the left-hand lane on the M1       Watch video  IKEA advertise a kitchen area by putting it at monkeys disposal       Watch video  'We have to deliver Brexit urgently': Andrea Leadsom       Watch video  Shaman Durek explains his teachings and philosophy           Watch video  Kerri-Anne Kennerley unleashes on Bill Shorten       Watch video  Trump says it would be mistake if Iran do anything against U.S.       Watch video  Nigel Farage and New European editor Matt Kelly clash over Brexit       Watch video  Fergus Kenny blasted by Jeremy Kyle during show broadcast in 2016
