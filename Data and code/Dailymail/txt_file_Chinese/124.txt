Donald Trump on Tuesday floated a plan to fine ZTE Corp. as much as $1.3 billion and shake up its management, as U.S. lawmakers vowed to keep sanctions that crippled the Chinese telecommunications firm.Trump said he could envision 'a very large fine' of 'more than a billion dollars. Could be a billion three.'Speaking to reporters at the White House about ongoing trade negotiations with China, the president said there was no deal with Beijing. In addition to the fine, Trump said ZTE should come under new management and name a new board of directors.         Donald Trump floated a plan Tuesday to fine Chinese smartphone maker ZTE Corp. as much as $1.3 billion in response to its illicit business that violated international sactions against Iran         The company is banned for seven years from buying American-made microchips and other components, effectively grinding its operations to a haltHe also insisted that as a condition of reopening at full strength, the firm would have to guarantee it would purchase a minimum fixed percentage of its device components from American companies. News reports have outlined a proposed trade deal with China being negotiated by the White House, which would lift a seven-year ban that prevents U.S. chipmakers and other companies from selling components to ZTE. The company is China's second-largest maker of smartphones and telecommunications networking gear.In return, China would eliminate tariffs on U.S. agriculture or agree to buy more farm products from the United States. But at present 'there is no deal,' the president insisted. 'We will see what happens. We are discussing deals. We’re discussing various deals.'Republicans and Democrats in Congress are accusing the president of bending to pressure from Beijing to ease up on a company that has admitted to violating sanctions on Iran. Their reaction could complicate U.S. efforts to win trade concessions from China to narrow a $335 billion annual trade gap.         China desperately wants ZTE to resume business at full strength and has expressed a willingness to import American agriculture products as a sweetener to get Trump to relent   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       'I'm not satisfied': Trump says he's NOT happy with the...

 'The proposed solution is like a wet noodle,' said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a new York Democrat. He accused Trump of jeopardizing national security for what he described as minor trade concessions.Schumer, speaking before Trump detailed his latest thinking on ZTE, added that the possible remedies floated earlier by the Trump administration were inadequate.The Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday also approved an amendment in an overwhelming 23-2 vote that would block Trump from easing sanctions on ZTE until he certifies to Congress that the company is complying with federal laws.The U.S. Commerce Department imposed the ban in April after it determined that ZTE had broken an agreement after it pleaded guilty to shipping U.S. goods and technology to Iran.The ban has threatened the viability of China's second-largest telecoms maker by cutting off access to companies that supply 25 percent to 30 percent of its components. Suppliers include some of the biggest U.S. tech companies, including Alphabet Inc's Google, which licenses its Android operating system to ZTE, and chipmaker Qualcomm Inc .                President Xi Jinping's country sent $375.2 billion more in goods to the U.S. last year than it imported in the other directionZTE last week said it had suspended its main operations.The U.S. Department of Defense has also stopped selling ZTE's mobile phones and modems in stores on its military bases, citing potential security risks.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers that the treatment of ZTE was not 'a quid pro quo or anything else' related to trade, and said national security concerns would be taken into consideration.'I can assure you that whatever changes or decisions that are made in Commerce will deal with the national security issues,' Mnuchin told a U.S. Senate appropriations subcommittee.Republican and Democratic lawmakers said they were looking at ways to block any possible changes. 'We will begin working on veto-proof congressional action,' Republican Senator Marco Rubio said on Twitter.Lawmakers are considering several possible options and aim to act 'soon,' said Dick Durbin, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat.       The Senate Banking Committee voted 23-2 on Tuesday to adopt a measure that would make it harder for the president to modify penalties on Chinese telecommunications firms. It was added to legislation that would tighten oversight of foreign direct investment.The Republican-controlled House of Representatives is weighing several possible changes to a defense-policy bill that would also keep up the pressure on ZTE. One proposal would block the sale of ZTE products and those of another Chinese company, Huawei Technologies, until national security officials certify they are safe.Another proposal would require the director of national intelligence to consider the security implications of any changes to the ZTE ban, while a third would require reports on quid pro quo offers between the U.S. and Chinese governments over any possible plan.
