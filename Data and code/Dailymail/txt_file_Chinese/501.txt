A northeastern city of China has announced a complete ban on joss paper, used to make paper money which is then burnt for the deceased. Over 9.6 million of Harbin's residents will be fined if they are found producing, selling or burning joss paper also known as ghost money, People's Daily reported. The ban on 'feudal superstition' was announced on March 14 and has been implemented to try and curb air pollution.          Burning for the dead: The ban came into effect on March 14 ahead of the Ching Ming Festival    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Home at last: Remains of 28 soldiers who died in the Korean...

Harbin resident caught burning joss paper will be fined from 200 yuan(£23) to 1,000 yuan(£116)         A photo taken in December 2015 shows heavy smog blanketing the Songhua river in HarbinHarbin government officials said burning joss paper, mainly made of recycled yellow paper, releases very fine PM2.5 particles into air, Sixth Tone reported. Yang Xiaodi, head of the environmental publicity, education, and information centre of the Harbin Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, said the measure aims to prevent further increase of PM 2.5 particles, the primary pollutant in the city. In winter, northern cities including Harbin are more prone to air pollution due to an over-reliance on burning coal for heating. However, Harbin is the only city in Heilongjiang province to implement the ban. A dozen joss paper makers told Chongqing Morning News that they have terminated production immediately.

People do not burn joss papers that often.' another user wondered.
