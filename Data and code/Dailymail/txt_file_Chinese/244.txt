Tiny bits of plastic are contaminating mussels from the European Arctic to China, a new study has revealed. Mussels in apparently pristine Arctic waters had the most plastic of any tested along the Norwegian coast, according to the researchers. The worrying discovery is a sign of the global spread of ocean pollution that can end up on people's dinner plates. Scroll down for video          Tiny bits of plastic are contaminating mussels from the European Arctic to China, a new study has revealed.

 The impact of microplastics' on marine life or humans when eaten is unclear. Scientists suspect you would have to eat vast amounts of shellfish to be at risk, straining even Belgian diets where moules et frites (mussels and French fries) are a favourite dish.         Past surveys have found microplastics off nations including China, Chile, Canada, Britain and Belgium (stock image)Professor Richard Thompson, an expert on microplastics at Plymouth University, said: 'It's a warning signal that we need to do something about reducing the input of plastic to the ocean.'It's a cause for concern at the moment rather than an alarm story for human consumption.'Almost 200 nations signed a UN resolution this month to eliminate plastic pollution in the seas, ranging from bottles to supermarket bags and food packaging, estimated at 8 million tonnes a year.

UN JOINS FIGHT AGAINST PLASTIC WASTE BY SEAN POULTER The UN could begin a crackdown on plastic pollution of the world's oceans as early as next week.Britain, which has promised a series of radical measures to reduce the environmental harm caused by the menace, is expected to back the plan.Environment Secretary Michael Gove is introducing legislation to ban the use of plastic microbeads in beauty and personal care products.         The United Nations is set to join the fight against plastic waste, pictured here off the coast of Roatan, Honduras on September 7, 2017He has also set up a team to investigate adopting a deposit and return scheme for plastic bottles to tackle waste by increasing recycling.Ships are prohibited from dumping plastic overboard but there is no international law against plastics flooding into the sea from the land.Delegates preparing for the UN environment ministers' meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, next week are setting up a working party to explore options for global action to tackle plastic waste.The UN has committed to a substantial reduction of plastic waste by 2025 but a resolution led by Norway says the long-term aim must be for zero plastic waste.The proposal suggests individual governments would be responsible for measuring plastic discharges into the sea and take their own measures to reduce and prevent these.These could include controls on the use of plastics and improved recycling.Norway also wants governments to clean up existing plastic from beaches, which breaks down and ends up in the food chain when it is be eaten by fish, shellfish, birds and other wildlife.A source close to the talks in Kenya told the BBC delegates would consider questions such as whether there should 'be a legally binding instrument prohibiting plastic from the land'.Eirik Lindebjerg from the World Wide Fund for Nature said the meeting could prove a turning point in the crisis.China and the European Union are the top producers of farmed mussels in a global business worth £2.24 billion ($3 billion).And scientists want to find out if microplastics might cause mussels or oysters to make pearls - in nature often produced to combat natural irritants like sand.Pearls might raise the value of some shellfish but also break the teeth of unlucky diners, Ms Lusher said.
