The challenge asks web users to make a knot with their fingers, and bonus points go to those who could do the trick one-handed.Medical experts said the ability to perform hand tricks, such as the 'finger knot', is likely due to joint hypermobility, a condition which sees a person being able to move their joints beyond a normal range.

Many people find it difficult to keep the three fingers straight while putting their little finger over the thumb         One web user, who failed to do the trick (pictured), said her hands looked like 'chicken feet'A topic page about the hand challenge was quickly set up on Weibo last week. People flocked to upload pictures of themselves trying to pull off Zhang Yishan's hand trick. Some managed to do it, but others said it was impossible.One Weibo user 'ling dang guo zi', who failed the challenge, said her hands looked like two 'chicken feet' when she made the attempt.The craze was carried forward into this week after a Chinese anchorwoman yesterday challenged web users to make a knot with their fingers.Li Sisi from China Central Television Station posted a picture on her Weibo account yesterday, which showed her interlocking her digits to form the shape of a knot. Ms Li's followers immediately joined in and shared pictures of them taking on the challenge in the comments. Apparently, they said 'finger knot' was easier to achieve, however the catch was to do the trick with just one hand.               People start showing other unusual finger moves they could do, such as making their fingers overlapping one another to form a curve (right) or crossing their fingers in a bizarre way (left)Medical experts, however, warned that people should not force themselves to hold these positions if they find them difficult.According to Dr Jane Simmonds, a registered physiotherapist at University College London, those who could perform the difficult finger tricks are likely to have joint hypermobility, a common phenomenon present in 20 to 30 per cent of the general population.Dr Simmonds said: 'Joint hypermobility is more common in children and females.'It is also more common in Asian and Afro Caribbean ethnic populations. This may account for one reason why finger tricks are popular in China.'However, Dr Simmonds said for those who don't have joint hypermobility, attempting to perform the tricks could cause pain.'It is not recommended to sustain or hold these stretched positions on the joints for extended periods of time as it may lead to joint and tissue irritation and pain.' Mr Daniel Brown, a consultant hand surgeon at The Bone & Joint Centre at Spire Liverpool Hospital, said most people would not be able to perform the finger knot. Mr Brown added: 'If people who don't have joint hypermobility try to do a finger knot, they are not likely to break their fingers, but it could cause them to stretch their ligaments and tendons, which could cause potential physical pain and may lead to instability of their joints and arthritis later in life.'Mr Brown also said only 'a small number of people with unusual anatomy' could do the finger trick Chinese actor Zhang Yishan has performed.              Apparently, some web users have incredible flexibility with their fingers, as their posts showBizarre challenges involving different parts of body have always been popular among Chinese social media users. In 2015, 130 million people joined in the so-called 'belly button challenge' as they tried to touch their navels by reaching around their backs. According to the organiser, the challenge was to test if the participants needed to lose weight.In another popular challenges, women flaunted their figures by showing how many coins they could hold with their collarbones - and the rule was the more coins they could carry, the more beautiful they were.Some other similar crazes have seen Chinese women trying to wrap banknotes around their wrists or to compare their waists with A4 paper to prove that they are skinny enough.However, these trends have sparked concerns among medical experts, who claimed that the challenges were promoting a worrying concept of beauty among people, especially women.
