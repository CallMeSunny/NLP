Her guardian was called to the checkpoint for further investigations.          'The girl's backpack was so full, it looked like it was going to burst open,' a customs official said         This is the second case this year to involve the smuggling of blood products, according to China Customs, adding that the haul was the largest they had uncovered in the past two yearsIt is unclear if the girl would be penalised. Calls from MailOnline to China Customs and the Luohu Customs office went unanswered. This is the second case this year to involve the smuggling of blood products, according to a Weibo statement by China Customs, adding that the haul was the largest they had uncovered in the past two years. China's now-abolished one-child policy, combined with the traditional preference for sons, have created a severe gender imbalance. As of 2015, there were 117 boys born for every 100 girls.  China banned all sex identification exams done for non-medical reasons in 2001 in order to prevent sex-selective abortions.          The girl was caught with a backpack full of blood samples at Luohu Port (pictured) in ShenzhenThe policy prompted many couples in mainland China to 'mail' blood samples to clinics in Hong Kong. The city has always been exempt from the one-child policy and has no regulations against determining the sex of an unborn child. At Hong Kong clinics, tests would be conducted to search for a Y-chromosome in a mother's blood.In a similar case in July 2017, a Shenzhen customs official was previously quoted as saying that they had seen an increase in the number of blood sample smuggles after the one-child policy was scrapped.What problems has the one-child policy caused in China?         For about 40 years, couples in China were only allowed to have one child (file photo)The one-child policy, combined with a traditional Chinese preference for having sons, has created a gender imbalance so severe that as of 2015 there were 117 boys born for every 100 girls.  The one-child policy has also left China with a ticking time bomb: a rapidly ageing population.The ambitious nation has apparently 'got old before getting rich', a frustrating factor for the world's second largest economy. China is ageing more rapidly than almost any country in recent history, reported Forbes, citing the United Nations.By 2050, China could face a serious labour shortage as the country's dependency ratio from retirees could rise as high as 44 per cent by mid 21st century, according to the same Forbes article.China had 222 million people aged 60 years or older as of 2015, according to Xinhua News Agency. The figure accounted for about 17 per cent of the nation's entire population.
