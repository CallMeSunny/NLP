 'What they did was unfortunate,' Trump told reporters earlier in Manila. He said the trio, who have been held since last week, could have faced long prison sentences, and described Xi's response as 'terrific.''They're working on it right now,' Trump said.Trump had raised the issue with Xi during a dinner held during the U.S. leader's November 8 to 10 state visit to Beijing. Trump was in the Philippines capital for a summit of Asian leaders.Asked about the trio and Trump's discussing the issue with Xi, China Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing in Beijing: 'Until now, I have not received any update, so I am unable to provide any further information.'

The scouting report did credit LiAngelo with being a good shooter with an improving post game. Younger brother LaMelo may be the biggest prospect of the Ball brothers and was taken out of Chino Hills High School so he can be made into 'the best basketball player ever,' according to father LaVar.Last season, LaMelo drew national attention by scoring 92 points in a game for Chino Hills.  He has publicly committed to UCLA as well. Father LaVar's Big Baller Brand makes sneakers, ranging in price from $220 to one pair that costs $995.Lonzo currently has his own signature shoe while LaMelo's is on its way. The MB1, which costs $395, is available for pre-order and will ship in December.According to Markazi, the Big Baller Brand had a pop-up shop scheduled for Wednesday in Hong Kong.          LaVar Ball (middle, back), LaMelo Ball (left) and LiAngelo Ball (right) pose for a portrait with Lonzo Ball (seated), who was drafted second overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in June
