 Supporters and foreign governments had urged China to allow him to receive treatment abroad however Chinese authorities insisted that he remain in the country. Liu had expressed a wish to seek medical treatment in either the US or Germany to help prolong his life. Doctors from both countries visited him earlier this week and said that he could be moved but staff at the hospital would need to act fast. Earlier today friends made the journey to the hospital in Shenyang to show their support however they were denied access. He was imprisoned for the first time in connection with the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. Liu helped negotiate the safe exit of thousands of student demonstrators from Beijing's Tiananmen Square on the night of June 3-4.          Liu Xiaobo speaks during an interview at a park in Beijing, China         In better times: Liu Xiaobo and his wife Liu Xia pictured together          Protestors prepare to post postcards written and addressed to terminally-ill Chinese Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo Charter 08   In 2008 just two days before he was set to publish his manifesto calling for political change in China, Liu was arrested. The manifesto called on the formation of a legislative democracy, new constitution and separation of powers. It declared China's approach to modernisation as 'disastrous'. It was signed by over 10,000 people.   Liu was arrested in 2008 after co-writing Charter 08, a petition that called for the protection of basic human rights and reform of China's one-party Communist system. He was jailed for 11 years.   In 2010 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Laureate Prize while serving his fourth prison sentence. Liu was banned from attending the awards ceremony with a chair left empty in his honour. In a statement, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said: 'We find it deeply disturbing that Liu Xiaobo was not transferred to a facility where he could receive adequate medical treatment before he became terminally ill.'The Chinese government bears a heavy responsibility for his premature death.'   He is survived by his wife Liu Xia who has been placed under house arrest since the time of her husband being awarded the Nobel award. She suffered a heart attack in 2014 and was diagnosed with depression after years of detention. Pro-democracy lawmakers in Hong Kong have gathered to protest, demanding Liu Xia to be freed from house arrest.          People mourn the death of jailed Chinese Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo         Protesters mourn the death of Liu Xiaobo outside the Chinese liaison officeWhile in China, the news is being blocked from the public with reports of candle emojis even being banned from social media site Weibo.  Western governments, rights groups and a coalition of Nobel prize winners had repeatedly called for his release. Liu was the first Chinese citizen to win the Nobel peace prize and only three people to have won it while detained by their own government.          The judicial bureau in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang says jailed Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo has died of multiple organ failure         Protesters hold candles demanding the release of the Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo
