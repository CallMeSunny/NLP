Zicong fell down the well by accident as he was playing in the fields.The boy had previously been reported to be six years old, but more updated reports said he was five years old. The boy's grandfather told a reporter from The Beijing News on an earlier occasion that the well was located near their house and had been used to irrigate the crops.The man also said that the well was about 40 metres deep (131 feet) and had been abandoned for around five years.After the family alerted the local police, police officers and firefighters immediately arrived at the scene of the accident.Rescuers used life detectors on November 8, but they failed to find any signs of life, according to local reports.          The boy's uncle, Song Jiandang, told a reporter from The Paper yesterday that the boy was not in the well          The man said he only saw a pile of dry mud at the bottom of the well as he carried out excavations in the morning on Thursday          When the body of Zicong was finally discovered at the bottom of the well yesterday, many people expressed their sorrow              165 machines, including dozens of diggers, forklift trucks, bulldozers and transport trucks, took part in the rescue operationAn aerial video posted by QQ.com on November 8 showed the heavy-duty vehicles sparing no effort digging into the earth in hope of save Zhao Zicong.The boy's uncle, Song Jiandang, told a reporter from The Paper yesterday that the boy was not in the well. The man said he only saw a pile of dry mud at the bottom of the well as he carried out excavations in the morning.This created a sense of mystery and shock in the Chinese media and many readers started wondering whether or not the boy had really fallen into the well. However, when the body of Zicong was finally discovered yesterday, many people expressed their sorrow on social media.One person wrote on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform: 'No precautions had been taken around the deserted well, someone must be held responsible.'Another Weibo user said: 'I want to cry. It's hard to imagine how the child had endured the last moments of his life.'A third person shared personal experience: 'Wells like this are deathtraps... When my brother was three years old, he stood by a well just like this, luckily a family member dragged him away. Recalling this crept me out.'In a more heart-breaking manner, Zicong's elderly grandfather, who had endured the hardest week of his life due to the missing of his grandson, knelt down in front of the rescue team last night to thank them - after he saw the dead body of the child being carried out of the well.
