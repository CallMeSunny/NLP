The Cheesegrater, one of London's tallest skyscrapers, has been sold to a Chinese investor for £1.15 billion.CC Land Holdings Ltd, a Hong Kong-based firm run by Chinese property magnate Cheung Chung-kiu, has agreed to purchase the iconic building from current owners British Land and Oxford Properties.The sale of the iconic building is being closely watched as an indicator of the property market's health after Britain's vote last year to leave the European Union, which caused an immediate drop in real estate prices. The 737ft Leadenhall Building, known as the Cheesegrater because of its distinctive wedge shape, was a joint venture between British Land and Oxford Properties, an investor in real estate for one of Canada's largest pension plans.          The 'cheesegrater', pictured centre, is one of London's tallest skyscrapers Officially called the Leadenhall Building, due to its location, the building took four years to complete and was opened in 2014 when it broke records for rents in the City.  The planning application for the skyscraper was first submitted to the City of London Corporation in February 2004 and was approved in May 2005, but a statement made to the London Stock Exchange inAugust 2008, British Land said it was delaying the project, which was due to start in October 2010.

 The developer announced on December 22, 2010 that the project was moving forward after contracts had been signed for the 50/50 joint venture with Oxford Properties, and construction got underway.The slanting wedge-shaped design of the tower was created so that it would have less impact on the protected sightline of St Paul's Cathedral when viewed from Fleet Street and the west. With 46-floors, the tower is the tallest building in the City of London.        If the sale goes through it will be the biggest property deal in the UK since 2014 when Qatar's sovereign wealth fund bought the HSBC Tower in Canary Wharf for £1.2billion. Contracts have been exchanged but the sale still has to be approved by shareholders of CC Land.Tim Roberts, head of offices and residential at British Land, said: 'British Land and Oxford Properties took a bold step at the early stages of the UK's economic recovery to develop the Leadenhall Building to generate a high-quality, long-term income stream. It's a decision which has really paid off.'This sale shows continued investor appetite for best-in-class, well-located property in London.'          Hong Kong-based CC Land Holdings Ltd has agreed to purchase the iconic buildingThe sale of the iconic building is one of the largest UK property deals so far by a Chinese investor. Known as the 'Li Ka-shing of Chongqing', 52-year-old Cheung moved to Hong Kong at the age of 16, where he built up a property empire.In 2007, he was ranked as the richest man in his hometown Chongqing, with an estimated personal wealth of £1.5 billion.The media-shy property tycoon was ranked 26th on the Forbes Rich List in 2007, but 98 per cent of his fortune was wiped out during the financial crisis.However, the property magnate managed to recover some of his fortune, and he now appears to be setting his sights on London.Cheung has already made other investments in the capital; YT Realty, which he chairs, bought the Travelodge Hotel near Liverpool Street station for £43 million last summer.CC Land also bought Vodafone's Paddington Headquarters for £290m in January. Revealed: How most of London's tallest skyscrapers are now foreign-owned          Some of London's tallest and most iconic buildings are owned by foreign investors The ShardThe Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company owns 95 per cent of the the tallest building in western Europe. One Canada SquareQatar owns swathes of the Canary Wharf financial district through its majority holding in Songbird Estates plc, including the main 1 Canada Square building.When Barclays was in trouble at the height of the banking turmoil, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) emerged as a white-knight investor, and became the biggest shareholder.And it previously bought 8 Canada Square - the home of Britain's biggest bank HSBC. GherkinIn 2014 a a Brazilian billionaire has paid more than £700million to buy The Gherkin – one of the most distinctive towers in the City of London.Joseph Safra, the banker behind the Safra Group who has a personal fortune of around £10billion, bought the skyscraper at 30 St Mary Axe for £726million.The 41-storey tower, designed by Sir Norman Foster, was completed in 2004 for insurance giant Swiss Re, which sold it for £600million in 2006 at the height of the last property boom.The deal left the buyers - Germany property investor IVG Immobilien and British investment bank Evans Randall - mired in debt, and The Gherkin fell into receivership three years ago.The Walkie TalkieThe £200million London skyscraper melted cars by reflecting sunlight so had to be fitted with shading. Joint developers Land Securities and Canary Wharf investigated and as a precautionary measure suspended parking in three bays in the areaWhen Canary Wharf was bought up by the Qataris in 2015 they now own half the building. CheesegraterThis is the latest London tall building to be bought up from abroad. CC Land Holdings Ltd, a firm run by Chinese property magnate Cheung Chung-kiu, has agree to pay £1.15billion pounds ($1.4billion) to buy London's 'Cheesegrater' skyscraper, owners British Land and Oxford Properties said yesterday.The sale of the Leadenhall Building, known as the Cheesegrater because of its wedge shape, will be slightly dilutive to British Land's earnings per share but accretive to its net asset value per share, the property company said.British Land and Oxford Properties each own 50 percent of the building. Oxford Properties invests in real estate for one of Canada's largest pension plans.Heron TowerThe Heron Tower is Brityish owned but previously dogged by rumours it could be sold.In 2013 Gerald Ronson, who bounced back and built a £220m property empire, was warned he could be about to see the administrators called in to his £500million Heron Tower.The warning came after a bust-up between the three controlling shareholders and sources said at the time that lenders could liquidate the 46-storey tower within the next 24 hours. Ronson nurtured the project over 16 years having bought the land in the 1990s and having survived the scare and it is still owned by his company Heron International.
