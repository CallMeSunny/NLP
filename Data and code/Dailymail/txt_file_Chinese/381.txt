China has built one of the world's largest hack-proof computer networks in a bid to protect state secrets from prying eyes.An advanced communications system will secure government, financial, military and other information from eavesdroppers.Information sent down fibre optic cables will be safeguarded using quantum encryption so advanced that it cannot be broken by current technology.Such breakthroughs could soon lead to a global quantum web that is 100 per cent secure from hackers.

(stock image) THE UNHACKABLE NETWORK   China has built one of the world's largest hack-proof computer networks in a bid to protect state secrets from prying eyes.An advanced communications system will secure government, financial, military and other information from eavesdroppers.Current technology relies on mathematical equations, that are too complex for most computers to crack.But, as processing power continues to grow, these equations have to be made increasingly complex to keep up.And there are fears that the next generation of quantum computers will make this method of protection obsolete.The Chinese project uses a technique called quantum key distribution to send data securely.Special keys are embedded into particles of light, which are needed to decode the information.The system has one cable for sharing photons and another for data transfer.  The upcoming launch of the project in Jinan, in China's eastern Shandong province, was first announced by state media earlier this month after testing of the system was successfully completed. The network uses a technique called quantum key distribution to send data securely.Before a message is sent, a special key is transmitted that is needed to decode the information.Both the key and the data are sent in particles of light, which are distorted or completely destroyed if anyone attempts to tamper with them.It will also alert both the sender and receiver to the attack. This will allow around 200 government workers in the city to transmit messages, across a 125 mile long (200km) network, safe in the knowledge that they cannot be successfully intercepted.A larger 1,250 mile (2,000km) long fibre-optic link from Beijing to Shanghai is planned for completion later this year.The network has been built by QuantumCTek, based in Hefei in eastern China.Speaking to The Register, CEO Yong Zhao, said: 'We think our tech is secure right now.'Why do we wait until quantum computers can break classical cryptography? 'We know there's no backdoor,' he added of the new network.The technology represents a leap forward in encryption techniques and anticipates the limitations of current methods.Hackers are increasingly able to circumvent protection efforts, thanks in part to increases in computing power.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Could this ¿Iron Man¿ robotic vest rescue Britain¿s...

        Keys are embedded into photons which are stored as ones or zeroes depending on the polarisation of the sub atomic particles. The system has one cable for sharing photons and another for data transfer (stock image)Current technology relies on mathematical equations, that are too complex for most computers to crack, to protect our dataBut, as processing power continues to grow, these equations have to be made increasingly complex to keep up.And there are fears that the next generation of quantum computers, which will be able to perform vastly more complex tasks, will make this method of protection obsolete. The Chinese project sidesteps this issue by using a totally different mechanism.Keys are embedded into photons which are stored as ones or zeroes depending on the polarisation of the sub atomic particles.The system has one cable for sharing photons and another for data transfer.This is not the first time China has experimented with quantum technology.         In a major breakthrough, the team established the first ground-to-satellite quantum network, which allowed them to transmit a photon from an entangled pair up to 870 miles (1,400 kilometers). An artist's impression of the Micius 'quantum' satellite is pictured In recent weeks, physicists revealed the details on a ground-breaking experiment to achieve ‘ultra-long-distance quantum teleportation,’ which could help to pave the way for a global quantum internet.In a major breakthrough, the team established the first ground-to-satellite quantum network, which allowed them to transmit a photon from an entangled pair up to 870 miles (1,400 kilometres).Entangled photons theoretically maintain their link across any distance, and have potential to revolutionise secure communications, but scientists have previously only managed to maintain the bond for about 62 miles (100 km). Pairs of entangled photons fired to ground stations can form a ‘secret key’ and, theoretically, any attempts to breach this type of communication would be easily detectable. In quantum physics, entangled particles remain connected so that actions performed by one affects the behaviour of the other, even if they are separated by huge distances. So, if someone were to attempt to listen in on one end, the disruption would be detectable on the other.  WHAT IS QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT?  In quantum physics, entangled particles remain connected so that actions performed by one affects the behaviour of the other, even if they are separated by huge distances.This means if you measure, 'up' for the spin of one photon from an entangled pair, the spin of the other, measured an instant later, will be 'down' - even if the two are on opposite sides of the world.Entanglement takes place when a part of particles interact physically. For instance, a laser beam fired through a certain type of crystal can cause individual light particles to be split into pairs of entangled photons.The theory that so riled Einstein is also referred to as 'spooky action at a distance'. Einstein wasn't happy with theory, because it suggested that information could travel faster than light.
