We have also cleared the stones near the enclosure,' the zookeeper said.However, she said the tourists picked the stones from somewhere else and threw it at the kangaroos. The female kangaroo will be sent to an institute to turn into a biological specimen.         A few days after the female kangaroo died, tourists were reportedly throwing bricks into the kangaroo enclosure again.
