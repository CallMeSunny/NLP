 A photographer from The Economic Daily newspaper took the images while travelling from Shanghai to Beijing on Wednesday. The majority of this journey went through the current red smog alert zone. China's high-speed trains travel at their highest speed at 300km an hour. The journey between the two cities takes around five hours on average.  The images prompted people online to post their own images of filthy trains travelling through northern China. This comes just after China released a nationwide red smog pollution warning with visibility in some areas down to just 160 feet.          In the middle: A high-speed bullet train is covered in dirt due to heavy smog after travelling through smoggy areas         The images prompted people online to post their own images of filthy trains travelling through northern China         Working hard: A Chinese worker cleans a Chinese high-speed train covered in dirt due to heavy smog          Air pollution: The recent smog is both dense and moist meaning that the trains are becoming blanketed in the dustOfficials have responded to the viral post in a report by the People's Daily Online.A mechanic from Beijing Railway Bureau told Beijing Youth Daily that there are trains with eight or sixteen cars. Every day the trains are sent to the train garages for cleaning. A cleaner is responsible for cleaning two to three train cars. The mechanic said: 'It takes half an hour to clean the train. But this time the smog made cleaning difficult and we have to spend more time.' Another member of railway staff added that the trains would be particularly dirty during the early morning and late at night as its more foggy during those times. Ma Jun, director of the Beijing-based Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, said at an interview with Beijing Youth Daily that the smog consists of aerosol particles, which would swell after they absorbed the moisture.As the recent smog is both dense and moist, if the trains had to travel a long journey through the area blanketed by smog, pollutants would stick on to the trains and they would get dirty.Many people have commented on the pictures on social media site Weibo. One user commented: 'The trains look like that now. How about our lungs?' While another wrote: 'The officials might regret producing white trains.' And one user said: 'Trains can be washed but not our lungs.'            Chinese workers clean a China Railway High-Speed train that has been coated in thick heavy smog         It comes after China released a nationwide red smog pollution warning with visibility in some areas down to just 160 feet       Need a bigger mop: Chinese workers team up together to clean the top of a high-speed rail carriage in Beijing
