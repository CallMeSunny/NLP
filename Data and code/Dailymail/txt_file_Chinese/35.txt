The doomed Ethiopian Airlines jet 'had smoke pouring from the rear' before coming down 'with a loud boom' in a crash which killed 157 people, a witness has said.Gebeyehu Fikadu said he saw flight ET302 'swerving and dipping' while 'luggage and clothes came burning down' when it crashed within minutes of take-off from Addis Ababa on Sunday morning.All 149 passengers and eight crew members on board the Nairobi-bound plane died in the disaster - the second involving a 737 MAX 8 in just five months. Last October, the same model of plane, operated by Lion Air, crashed in Indonesia, killing 189 people, and experts have highlighted the similarities between the two tragedies. The Boeing aircraft have been grounded in Indonesia, China and Mexico while U.S. officials said they would take 'immediate action' if they found safety flaws in the planes. Ethiopian Airlines, Cayman Airways and a private South African carrier have also taken the jets out of service. As Ethiopia marked a day of mourning and the search for remains entered a second day, rescuers said they had recovered the aircraft's black box which is expected to shed light on the cause of the crash. In addition the number of British victims was revised up to nine on Monday after the Foreign Office discovered that some of them were dual nationals.          US plane maker Boeing is facing questions over the safety of one of its key aircraft models after an Ethiopian Airlines jet crashed killing 157 - the second disaster involving a 737 MAX 8 in just five months. Pictured: The crash scene on Monday         China - an important market for Boeing - became the first country to ground the 737 MAX 8 on Monday. Ethiopian Airlines did the same, saying the decision came as an 'extra safety precaution' while Caribbean carrier Cayman Airways is temporarily grounding two of the aircraft.

 Another witness, Tegegn Dechasa, told AFP 'the plane was already on fire when it crashed to the ground. The crash caused a big explosion.'Malka Galato, the farmer whose land the plane crashed on, told Reuters he saw small items that looked like paper coming from the plane.The jet was making a strange noise and made a sudden turn just before it crashed, he said.Another farmer Sisay Gemechu, added: 'The plane seemed to be aiming to land at a nearby level open field, but crashed before reaching there.'              A diagram showing where the plane crashed and explaining the history of the Boeing jet          Rescue teams look on as a digger searches for bodies at the scene of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET 302 plane crash         Mourners attend a memorial service held by an association of Ethiopian airline pilots in Addis Ababa yesterday                Last tweet: Joanna Toole posted online just days before she died to celebrate the number of women working for the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, in a tweet to mark International Women's Day          Yared Mulugeta Getachew (pictured) was the main pilot on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302Boeing said on Monday morning there was no need to issue new guidance to operators of its 737 MAX 8 aircraft based on investigations so far.But shares in Boeing Co slid nearly 10 per cent in early trading on Monday in one of the firm's worst days on the stock market since 9/11.The firm had recovered about half its losses by the close of the trading day. Airlines in Brazil, China, Ethiopia, Indonesia, South Africa, Mexico and other countries said they were suspending operations of their 737 MAX 8 fleets. Pilots from Argentina's Aerolinas Argentinas have refused to fly the aircraft. According to flight tracking websites, the 'brand new' jet took off at about 8.39am but crashed minutes later having climbed to 8,600ft and reached a ground speed of 383 knots (441mph).Data revealed the plane's vertical speed - the rate of climb or descent - was 'unstable' and varied from 2,624 feet per minute to minus 1,216 within minutes of take off.The airline's CEO said the pilot, who had 8,000 hours of flying experience, reported 'difficulties' and had asked for clearance to return to Addis Ababa before the crash.The MAX 8 is the latest version of the best-selling commercial jet in history and is operated by scores of airlines around the world - including in the UK.Boeing says it has taken more than 4,700 orders for the single-aisle family of planes which can carry up to 230 passengers. U.S. aviation officials had issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive warning that pilots of Boeing 737-8 and 737-9 planes 'could have difficulty controlling the airplane' because of a problem with one of its systems. A faulty sensor could cause 'excessive nose-down attitude, significant altitude loss, and possible impact with terrain', the Federal Aviation Administration had warned.            Members of the Ethiopian Airline Pilots' Association mourn as they attend a memorial service for the crashed flight today          ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA - MARCH 10: Rescue and recovery personnel use an earth mover to recover debris from the area         Pictures have emerged showing the scale of the crash site from above.  Diggers have been excavating the site in a bid to locate bodies         Malka Galato, the farmer whose land the plane crashed on, told Reuters he saw small items that looked like paper coming from the plane.

The victims came from more than 30 nations and included 22 United Nations' staff Which countries have grounded Boeing's new plane and which ones are still flying it?    Boeing's 737 MAX 8 medium-haul workhorse jet was grounded in China, Ethiopia and Indonesia on Monday after an Ethiopian Airlines crash killed all 157 people on board.The Nairobi-bound plane was the same type as the Indonesian Lion Air jet that crashed in October, killing 189 passengers and crew - with some detecting similarities between the two accidents.Elsewhere however airlines said they would continue flying the aircraft pending an investigation into the crash and possible guidance from Boeing itself.Most simply continued to operate the 737 MAX 8 without communicating about their decision.NATIONS GROUNDING THEIR BOEING 737 MAX 8:ChinaChina on Monday ordered domestic airlines to suspend commercial operation of the Boeing 737 MAX 8, citing the Ethiopian Airlines accident and last year's crash of the same model in Indonesia.Noting 'similarities' between the two accidents, China's Civil Aviation Administration said operation of the model would only resume after 'confirming the relevant measures to effectively ensure flight safety'.China is a hugely important market for the US aircraft company, accounting for about one-fifth of worldwide deliveries of Boeing 737 MAX models.IndonesiaIndonesia, where a Boeing plane of the same model crashed in October, said it was grounding its 11 jets of the 737 MAX 8 type.Inspections of the aircraft would start Tuesday and the planes would remain grounded until they were cleared by safety regulators, Director General of Air Transport Polana Pramesti told reporters.Ten of Indonesia's Max 8 jets are operated by Lion Air while the other is flown by national carrier Garuda.EthiopiaEthiopian Airlines said Monday it had grounded its Boeing 737 MAX 8 fleet.'Following the tragic accident of ET 302... Ethiopian Airlines has decided to ground all B-737-8 MAX fleet... until further notice,' the state-owned carrier said.'Although we don't yet know the cause of the accident, we have to decide to ground the particular fleet as an extra safety precaution,' said the airline, Africa's largest.MexicoMexican flag carrier Aeromexico revealed late on Monday that it was suspending operation of its six Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes until it had more information about the Ethiopia investigation. Brazil Brazilian airline Gol announced on Monday it was grounding its Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, saying that they were doing everything possible to resume the grounded flights as soon as possible.  South AfricaPrivate South African airline Comair announced on Monday it had taken its only Boeing 737 MAX 8 out of its flight schedule, saying it was doing so voluntarily 'while it consults with Boeing and technical experts'.  NATIONS WHICH HAVE NOT GROUNDED THE PLANES: RussiaRussian airline S7 said it was closely following the ongoing investigation into the crash and was in contact with Boeing, but had received no instructions from the US plane maker to stop flying the 737 MAX 8.TurkeyThe CEO of Turkish Airlines, which flies 11 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, said in a tweet that the carrier is in touch with Boeing and that passenger security was paramount.The aircraft however would continue to fly as scheduled.ItalyAir Italy said it was in 'constant dialogue with the authorities' and would follow all directives 'to ensure the maximum level of safety and security'. In the meantime, the planes remained in the air.Iceland Icelandair's operations chief Jens Thordarson told Frettabladid that it would be 'premature' to link the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia together.For now, 'nothing pushes us towards the slightest action', he said.This could change depending on the outcome of an ongoing probe but 'for now, there is no reason to fear these machines'.Icelandair operates three Boeing 737 MAX 8 and has options to buy more.NorwayNorwegian Air Shuttle, which operates 18 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, said it would keep them in the air.DubaiAirline flydubai said it was 'monitoring the situation' and that it was 'confident in the airworthiness of our fleet'.OmanOman Air said it was in contact with Boeing 'to understand if there are any implications for other airlines operating the same model'. By AFP    In Britain, holiday operator Tui Airways has ordered 32 Max aircraft as part of a major fleet overhaul and took delivery of its first Max 8 in December. Tui was the first UK-registered airline to receive one of the new Boeing aircraft and plans to roll out its orders over the next five years.A spokesman for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said there are currently five MAX 8s registered and operational in Britain with a sixth aircraft due to enter operation for Tui later this week. Are 737 Max 8 jets safe? Boeing faces troubling questions after second crash in five months Boeing issued a safety warning last November about its new 737 Max jets which could have a fault that causes them to nose-dive.The special bulletin sent to operators was about a sensor problem flagged by Indonesian safety officials investigating the crash of a Lion Air 737 that killed 189 people just a week before the memo was sent.Since the 737 Max was unveiled in 2017, 350 of the jets have been bought, with around a further future 4,761 orders placed. More than 40 airlines around the world use the 737 Max, which has four kinds in the fleet, numbered 7, 8, 9 and 10.Airlines such as Norwegian Air, Air China, TUI, Air Canada, United Airlines, American Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Icelandair and FlyDubai use the aircraft with hundreds in operation around the world.The 8 series, which was involved in the crash in Indonesia, has only been in commercial use since 2017.Boeing said in November that local aviation officials believed pilots may have been given wrong information by the plane's automated systems before the fatal crash.An AOA sensor provides data about the angle at which wind is passing over the wings and tells pilots how much lift a plane is getting.According to a technical log the Lion Air plane, which had only been in service a few months, suffered instrument problems the day before because of an 'unreliable' airspeed reading.         The MAX models  are relatively new but has already been investigated after problems reported. Pictured: Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 (stock image)Minutes after take-off the plane suddenly nose-dived hitting speeds of 600mph before slamming into the sea.The warning issued today read: 'The Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee has indicated that Lion Air flight 610 experienced erroneous input from one of its AOA (Angle of Attack) sensors.'Boeing issued an Operations Manual Bulletin (OMB) directing operators to existing flight crew procedures to address circumstances where there is erroneous input from an AOA sensor.'As a result of an investigation into the crash the jet manufacturer is said to be preparing a bulletin to be sent to operators of the 737 jets warning about faulty cockpit readings that could cause a dive.The notice refers to the 'angle of attack', which is the angle of the wing relative to oncoming air stream, a measure that indicates if a plane is likely to stall.This angle of attack, which is a calculation of the angle at which the wind is passing over the wings, is used to be determined if a stall is imminent.Inspectors found faults on two other Boeing 737 MAX jets, including one which mirrored a problem reported on board the Lion Air plane.A Tui spokesman said: 'TUI Airways remain in close contact with the manufacturer and regulatory authorities and we have no indication that we cannot safely operate our 737 MAX aircraft. 'The safety and wellbeing of our customers and staff remains our primary concern.'  Scandinavian airline Norwegian, which serves London Gatwick, Manchester and Edinburgh in the UK, has 18 Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft.Tomas Hesthammer, the carrier's director of flight operations, said: 'All of our Boeing 737 Max aircraft are operating as normal.'However Labour peer Lord Tunnicliffe, a former pilot, urged the Government to immediately ground the Boeing plane.He said: 'In my day we had a rule - If it can go wrong it will go wrong. The industry seems to have lost sight of this rule. I believe everybody involved will be shown to be in dereliction of their duty.'The number of British victims was revised up to nine on Monday after the Foreign Office discovered that some of them had dual nationality.British-Somali passengers Sarah Hassan Said and Nasrudin Abdulakir, and 25-year-old aid worker Sam Pegram, were named as British victims yesterday.Mr Pegram's old secondary school, Penwortham Priory Academy, confirmed their old pupil's death and said he was remembered 'with great fondness'.In addition to UN worker Joanna Toole, polar expert Sarah Auffet and Joseph Waithaka from Hull, the latest news means that six out of nine British victims have now been named.  Ms Toole's father described her as a 'very soft and loving person' and said: 'It's hard to imagine life without her'.The 36-year-old was one of at least 12 passengers travelling to Nairobi for a UN environment gathering.On Twitter she described herself as an 'ocean protectionist, lover of yoga and vegan foodie' who was 'passionate' about the Earth.Ms Toole's father Adrian told Sky News: 'It's dreadful she won't be able to carry on her work. I don't think I'll ever give up expecting her to ring.'He also revealed his daughter kept homing pigeons and pet rats and would travel to the Faroe Islands in a bid to prevent whaling.Mr Toole said she had flown around the world but added: 'Personally I never wanted her to be on a single one of those planes'.One of her UN colleagues, Manuel Barange, called her a 'wonderful human being who loved her work with a passion', saying he was 'so profoundly sad and lost for words' at the news of her death.Polar expert Sarah Auffret, who had French and British dual nationality, was also killed in the crash. Colleagues paid tribute to her as a 'true friend and beloved colleague'.'Words cannot describe the sorrow and despair we feel,' her employers at the Norway-based Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators said.Raised in Brittany, the environmental agent was leading AECO's efforts to cut back single-use plastics on Arctic expeditions and coordinating beach clean-ups.Tributes were also paid by the University of Plymouth, where she graduated in European Studies and German.'The university was deeply saddened to learn of the tragic death of Sarah Auffret over the weekend and sends its deepest condolences to her family and friends,' a spokesman said.'Sarah was an exemplary student who fully embraced university life and took every opportunity to develop herself while she was here.'She is remembered as someone who had a passion for learning about Europe and a strong moral compass.'In her role at the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators, Sarah had also met several of the university's leading scientists at the Arctic Frontiers conference in Tromso this year.'They, like many others in the audience, had been deeply impressed with her presentation on plastic pollution and her evident passion for the planet.'                 Photographs of the crew members of the Ethiopian Airlines flight are displayed during a memorial service in Addis Ababa          An Ethiopian man prays at an Ethiopian Orthodox church in Nairobi on Monday a day after the crash which killed 157 people         Women sit in front of photographs of the crew members of the Ethiopian Airlines flight ET 302 in Addis Ababa on Monday          Boeing said on Monday the investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines crash is in its early stages and there is no need to issue new guidance to operators of its 737 MAX 8 aircraft based on the information it has so far.

All 157 people on board were killed on Sunday          How airlines around the world have ordered thousands of MAX 8 jets  Since the 737 Max was unveiled in 2017, 350 of the jets have been bought, with around a further future 4,761 orders placed. More than 40 airlines around the world use the 737 Max, which has four kinds in the fleet, numbered 7, 8, 9 and 10. Many consider the MAX 8, with a range of 3,550 nautical miles and top speed of 530mph, the darling of the aviation industry thanks in part to its suitability for the increasingly popular short-haul market.It adds fuel efficiency and a seat capacity of 210 to the workhorse reputation of the existing single-aisle 737.According to CNN, one of the selling points of the MAX range is its LEAP jet engines which Boeing says 'redefine the future of efficient and environmentally friendly air travel.'This, the firm says, means the 737 MAX is between 10 per cent to 12 per cent more efficient than their predecessors  According to Boeing's website, 16 airlines have taken delivery of the 737 MAX 8.A spokesman for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said there are currently five MAX 8s registered and operational in Britain with a sixth aircraft due to enter operation later this week. Tui Airways became the first UK airline to receive a Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft in December last year and plans to have a total of 32 in its fleet.There are currently 15 of the aircraft across Tui's six European airlines.  Other airlines using the model include Air Italy, SilkAir, SpiceJet, Aerolineas Argentinas and Flydubai. Several North American airlines also operate the aircraft.Southwest Airlines flies 31 of the aircraft, while American Airlines and Air Canada each have 24 in their fleet.Thousands more are said to have been ordered by carriers around the world. Southwest Airlines, Ryanair, Flydubai, Jet Airways, Norwegian Air Shuttle and American Airlines are reportedly among airlines that have placed orders for more than 100 of the jets.  Another victim, 55-year-old Joseph Waithaka, lived in Hull for more than a decade before returning to his native Kenya in 2015.The BBC reported he had dual Kenyan and British citizenship.He had been visiting his wife and children, who still live in Hull, and was on his way back to Kenya via Ethiopia when he boarded the doomed flight aboard the jet.Mr Waithaka worked for the probation service during his time in Hull and his family said he had 'helped so many people' during his time in England.His son, Ben Kuria, said: 'My dad was a private man but he also had a pastoral heart. He really championed people. He really helped people realise their potential.'He would tell stories which would inspire the young people he was helping who were not at a great time in their lives.'As a father he was very protective and he really wanted us to do well. He supported us and ensured we got stuck into our education. He really rooted for his children.' The one Irish victim was named as engineer Michael Ryan, an employee of the UN's World Food Programme - which said seven of its staff members had died in the crash, including two Italians.The Rome-based aid worker and engineer, known as Mick, was from Lahinch in Co Clare in Ireland's west and was believed to be married with two children.Only the flight data and cockpit conversation contained in the doomed Ethiopian Airlines aircraft's two black boxes can provide tangible evidence of what may have caused the latest accident - technical problems, pilot error or a combination of factors.The recorders were found yesterday, but an airline official said one of the recorders was partially damaged and 'we will see what we can retrieve from it.'The pilot had been given clearance to turn around after reporting difficulties and weather conditions were good.    Flight-tracking data revealed that the plane's vertical speed - the rate of climb or descent - varied from 2,624 feet per minute to minus 1,216 within minutes of take-off.Aviation experts described the data as extremely unusual, saying that once a plane has taken off the vertical speed should rise or remain stable.          Passenger 'missed flight because he arrived two minutes late to board'  A Greek man who narrowly missed the Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed near Addis Ababa on Sunday says he argued with ground staff to try and board after reaching the gate minutes too late.'I saw the last passengers going through but the gate had already closed. I complained, in the usual way when that kind of thing happens.          Antonis Mavropoulos said on Sunday he would have been the 150th passenger on the Nairobi-bound Ethiopian Airlines Boeing plane that crashed killing all on board         The Greek national posted on his Facebook page with a post titled 'My lucky day''But they were very kind and placed me on another flight,' Antonis Mavropoulos told Greece's private Skai Television, speaking from Nairobi.Mavropoulos, who runs a recycling company and lives in Athens, was traveling to Kenya to attend an environmental conference.'I'm slowly coming to terms with what happened and how close it came. On the other hand, I'm also very upset - I'm shattered - for those who were lost,' he said in the interview Monday. 'To be honest, I didn't get much sleep last night.'Mavropoulos put his survival down to luck.'I didn't check my suitcase because I knew the gap between connecting flights was tight. If I had checked the bag in, they would have waited for me,' he said. 'This is a very difficult moment - one that can change your life.' Expert Sally Gethin said the plane's rapidly fluctuating speed may indicate that the aircraft stalled in the moments before it crashed.She said: 'It's the rate of climb or descent - the most critical phases of flight. Instability at that point e.g. too slow - could destabilise the aircraft, potentially risking stalling and other hazardous consequences. It might indicate the pilots had difficulty controlling the climb/ascent.'An experienced pilot told MailOnline the activity was highly unusual.He said: 'A positive number indicates the aircraft is going up. After takeoff you would expect all these numbers to be positive as the aircraft climbed away from the ground, or zero if they are flying level.'The small amount of data released so far indicates that after only one minute or so of the flight this aircraft started a descent at a rate of up to 1920 feet per minute down. If the data is correct that is extremely unusual.'The data then shows the aircraft going up and down until the data stops. That is why some people are referring to unstable vertical speed.'You would not expect a descent unless you were immediately returning, and if that was the case you wouldn't then expect the aircraft to climb again.'After takeoff aircraft either climb or fly level for a period then climb again.'  Teal Group expert Richard Aboulafia said it was 'too soon to make any kind of meaningful comment,' but another industry expert stressed the similarities between the two incidents.'It's the same plane. Like Lion Air, the (Ethiopian Airlines) accident took place shortly after takeoff and the pilots signalled they were experiencing problems, then the plane crashed. The similarities are clear,' the unnamed expert said.Chinese aviation authorities also noted the 'similarities' between the two deadly incidents, saying operations would only resume after 'confirming the relevant measures to effectively ensure flight safety.'Boeing has delivered 76 of the aircraft to Chinese airlines, and another 104 are on order, according to data from the company's website.But Michel Merluzeau, director of Aerospace & Defense Market Analysis, noted that 'these are the only similarities, and the comparison stops there as we do not have any other reliable information at this juncture.'Since the Lion Air accident, the 737 MAX has faced growing scepticism from the aviation community. The programme had already encountered problems during development.After investigators said the doomed aircraft had problems with its airspeed indicator and angle of attack (AoA) sensors, Boeing issued a special bulletin telling operators what to do when they face the same situation.An AoA sensor provides data about the angle at which air passes over the wings and tells pilots how much lift a plane is getting. The information can be critical in preventing an aircraft from stalling.  The United Nations secretary-general said at least 21 U.N. staff members died in the crash on Sunday along with an undetermined number of people who had worked closely with the world body.Antonio Guterres spoke at the opening of the annual meeting of the Commission on the Status of Women, which began with hundreds of delegates standing in silent tribute to the 157 victims.The U.N. Security Council also began its meeting on Afghanistan with diplomats standing in honor of those who perished.Guterres said that 'a global tragedy has hit close to home and the United Nations is united in grief.'He said the U.N. staff members came from all corners of the globe and that 'they all had one thing in common - a spirit to serve the people of the world and to make it a better place for us all.'             Wreckage lies at the crash site after the Ethiopian Airlines jet came down within minutes of take-off on Sunday morning         A piece of charred luggage from ET Flight 302 can be seen in the foreground as local residents collect debris at the scene         Rescue workers collect bodies in bags at the crash site of Ethiopia Airlines near Bishoftu following Sunday's air disaster         Members of the search and rescue mission look for dead bodies of passengers at the scene of the Ethiopian Airlines crash                The graphic shows how the plane's vertical speed fluctuated in the minute before it crashed near Addis Ababa airport          Members of the search and rescue mission look for dead bodies of passengers at the scene of the Ethiopian Airlines disaster         The wreckage of the plane - showing the colours of the Ethiopian flag on the plane's livery - lies at the scene of the crash                             The families of those on the plane have been arriving at special information centres to find out their next steps         Family members of the victims involved in a plane crash react at Addis Ababa international airport Sunday, hours after their loves ones took off         Ethiopia Airlines group CEO, Mr Tewolde Gebremariam, who is pictured at the accident scene.

An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 went down within six minutes of take-off on Sunday morning (pictured: stock image)         Ethiopian Airlines Group CEO Tewolde GebreMariam inspects the newly-arrived Boeing 737 Max 8 months before the crashInitial reports yesterday showed considerable similarities between the Ethiopian and Indonesian disasters which involve the same plane.Yesterday's flight lost contact about six minutes after take-off, having requested and been given clearance to return to the airport in Abbis Ababa.Last year, Lion Air 610 also went down minutes after take-off having requested permission to return to base.Yesterday, telemetry shows the plane's vertical airspeed fluctuated rapidly in the minutes and second before its crash, including in the final moments when it seems to have been locked in a terrifyingly accelerating nosedive,.Investigations thus far by the Indonesian and American aviation authorities have concluded the Lion Air plane also hit the sea after a violent nosedive.The New York Times reports that investigators are considering whether that dive might have been caused by updated Boeing software that was meant to prevent a stall - but that can send the plane into a fatal descent if the altitude and angle information being fed into the computer system is incorrect.The change in the flight control system, which can override manual motions in the Max model, was not explained to pilots, according to some pilots' unions.After that crash, Boeing said that it was continuing 'to evaluate the need for software or other changes as we learn more from the ongoing investigation.' It was unclear if the company had made any changes.In a statement on Sunday, Boeing said it was 'deeply saddened' to learn of the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.       Indonesian emergency services carry a body bag in the wake of the Lion Air disaster last year  'A Boeing technical team is prepared to provide technical assistance at the request and under the direction of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board,' the company said.The state-owned Ethiopian Airlines calls itself Africa's largest carrier and has ambitions of becoming the gateway to the continent.The airline does have a better safety rating and a newer fleet than some neighbouring operators - a number of African airlines are banned outright from EU airspace including the flag-carrier of neighbouring Eritrea.But in addition to 16 fatal incidents costing 102 lives in the 1960s, 70s, and 1980s; the airline has now suffered six fatal incidents in the last thirty years, including other two huge tragedies.In 1996 after a hijacking and a failed water landing, 125 people died on Flight 961 in Moroni, the capital of the Union of the Comoros in the Indian Ocean.And in January 2010, 82 passengers and eight crew died when EA flight 409 from Beirut to Addis Ababa slammed into the Mediterranean shortly after take-off. Boeing's 737 is the world's most-sold passenger jet family and is considered one of the industry's most reliable. The MAX 8 is the latest version of the aircraft, which Boeing rolled out in 2017 as an update to the already redesigned 50-year-old 737.By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 MAX jets out of the total order tally of 5,011 aircraft.
