 A worker at the bathhouse, who helped the couple open the door of their locker, appeared to be shocked when she saw there was a child inside. It remains unclear if the child is a boy or a girl, or how long the child had been left in the locker.However, according to the report, though the child was crying when it was freed from the locker, it did not show any symptoms of suffocation.              A popular video on Chinese social media shows a couple waiting for a worker to open the door of a locker (left) before pulling a child out of the small cabinet in a changing roomAfter being uploaded onto the Chinese social media platforms, the video has sparked an outrage.On Weibo, the Chinese equivalent to Twitter, many people were shocked by the couple's behaviour, calling them 'careless', 'selfish' and 'irresponsible'.One user commented: 'The child looked powerless when it was pulled out. How scared the child must have been after being left in such a dark and small space.'Another user said: 'How careless could the parents be? The child is not an object. If it's not convenient, then don't go to take the bath.'Some people worried about the child might suffer from claustrophobia in the future, while others claimed the parents should be deprived of their guardianship of the child if the accusations turn out to be true.
