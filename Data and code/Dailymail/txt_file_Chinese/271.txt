She might have taken a tumble on the Victoria's Secret runway, but Ming Xi did it in serious style.
She faced every model's nightmare this week as she fell to her knees on the catwalk in Shanghai during the annual fashion show, but nobody was focusing on her mis-step when she was looking so fab in Victoria's Secret lingerie paired with Brian Atwood over-the-knee gladiator sandals and with blossom tree branches attached to her back!
The good news about the pretty grey bra with a metallic shimmer to finish it off is that it's up for grabs to buy now (right). It boasts pretty scalloped lace trims and bow detail on each strap too. It's super sexy with a wintry feel.
