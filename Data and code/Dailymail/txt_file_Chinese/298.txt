A smash-hit survival computer game that has sold over 13 million copies since its release in March could be banned from China. China's media regulators said the game is too bloody and violent for sale in the country. The game also 'deviates from the values of socialism'. The game known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) has a competition concept and is similar to the film 'The Hunger Games.'Players are parachuted onto an island to scavenge for weapons that range from frying pans to AK-47s and fight each other until only one player survives.         The game is like 'The Hunger Games,' 100 combatants are dropped onto an island (file photo)         Smash-hit: Images from the popular Battle Royale style game PUBG developed by BlueholeAccording to Bloomberg, the video-game office of the official China Audio-Video Copyright Association published a notice on October 27.It will be unlikely to get a licence to officially launch.The Chinese content watchdog said in its online statement, it compares PUBG and similar survival games with ancient Rome's gladiator battles.  It said said the game's last-person standing, battle to the death-style makeup presents a 'deviation' from the country's 'core socialist values and traditional Chinese culture and ethical norms'.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Engineer, 31, who married his robotic girlfriend to appease...

PUBG's main problem is that the underlying ideology clashes with what's preached in China.' PUBG currently has no local publisher in China, however the nation's largest gaming company Tencent was talking to Blue Hole about a license deal to put the title on consoles and mobile phones.A dominant player in China's gaming market, Tencent already owns popular mobile and PC titles such as King of Glory,  League of Legends and Clash of Clans.
