China is developing an advanced new spaceship capable of both flying in low-Earth orbit and landing on the moon, according to state media, in another bold step for a space program that equaled the U.S. in number of rocket launches last year.The newspaper Science and Technology Daily cited spaceship engineer Zhang Bainian as saying the new craft would be recoverable and have room for multiple astronauts. While no other details were given in the Tuesday report, Zhang raised as a comparison the Orion spacecraft being developed by NASA and the European Space Agency. Scroll down for video         China is developing an advanced new spaceship capable of both flying in low-Earth orbit and landing on the moon. Newspaper Science and Technology Daily cited spaceship engineer Zhang Bainian as saying new craft would be recoverable and have room for multiple astronauts CHINA'S PLANS FOR SPACE EXPLORATION   Since 2009, China has been upping its work in space exploration in a number of stages.Each stage has been given a name to refer to the mission plans.Stage 1 'Around': Yinghuo-1 was launched in 2009 with the aim of bringing back samples however it was left stranded in orbit and disintegrated.Stage 2 'Landing': Yinghuo-2 is expected to launch in 2020 to collect data on MarsStage 3 'Circular': A rover will be sent to Mars to carry out explorationThe agency hopes Orion will carry astronauts into space by 2023.China's Shenzhou space capsule used on all six of its crewed missions is based on Russia's Soyuz and is capable of carrying three astronauts in its re-entry module.China came late to crewed space flight, launching its first man into space in 2003, but has advanced rapidly since then. In its most recent crewed mission, two astronauts spent a month aboard a Chinese space station late last year.A fully functioning, permanently crewed space station is on course to begin operations in around five years and a manned lunar mission has been suggested for the future.Now firmly established among the big three in space travel, China last year moved ahead of Russia for the first time in number of rocket launches and equaled the United States at 22, according to Harvard University astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Google co-founder Larry Page's mysterious flying car company...

 Russia had 17 launches, while the U.S. might have had several more if Space X's Falcon 9 rocket fleet hadn't been grounded following a Sept. 1 launchpad explosion.         The Chang'e-5 lunar probe is undergoing a final round of tests and is expected to be on standby for launch from August, the official People's Daily said, citing the China National Space AdministrationEarlier this week, Chinese officials revealed plans to launch a space probe to the moon, and bring back samples before the end of the year.According to the official People’s Daily, the Chang'e-5 lunar probe is undergoing a final round of tests and is expected to be on standby for launch from August.The paper, citing the China National Space Administration, reported that the mission will come with new challenges, including sample collection, taking off from the moon, and high-sped re-entry to the Earth’s atmosphere.Hu Hao, an official from China's Lunar Exploration Programme, told the paper that it will be ‘one of China’s most complicated and difficult space missions.’  TRUMP'S MANNED MOON MISSIONNASA’s top staff was given instructions to assess the feasibility of sending humans to space with the first flight of the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft.The mission was originally designed to be uncrewed, and was set to launch in 2018.In a press conference, officials leading the study revealed the evaluations are now well underway, and they’ve already created a 'hard, crisp list' of everything that will need to change ‘from a hardware standpoint’ in order to add crew.         NASA’s top staff was given instructions to assess the feasibility of sending humans to space with the first flight of the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraftBut, so far, the team says they’re sticking to their baseline plan for EM-1, and will let the ‘let the data drive’ any decisions moving forward.It will see Nasa's Orion, stacked on a Space Launch System rocket capable of lifting 70 metric tons will launch from a newly refurbished Kennedy Space Center in November 2018.The uncrewed Orion will travel into Distant Retrograde Orbit, breaking the distance record reached by the most remote Apollo spacecraft, and then 30,000 miles farther out (275,000 total miles).The mission will last 22 days and was originally designed to test system readiness for future crewed operations.The space agency hopes to send a probe to the dark side of the moon by 2018, and have astronauts on the lunar surface by 2036.In January, China’s space agency announced plans to launch two missions to Mars, and a probe to Jupiter.Vice Director of China’s National Space Administration Wu Yanhua said the first probe would be sent to Mars by 2020.Then, a second probe will be launched to collect samples and conduct research on the red planet’s structure, composition, and environment.        THE HISTORIC SPACEX MOON MISSION         Musk says the mission will 'skim the surface of the moon, go quite a bit further out into deep space' and then return to Earth. However, he has refused to reveal who the two paying tourists areSpaceX will launch the private mission on a journey to circumnavigate the moon and return to Earth.Lift-off will be from Kennedy Space Center's historic Pad 39A near Cape Canaveral – the same launch pad used by the Apollo program for its lunar missions. The mission will use one of SpaceX's Dragon capsules, which will be modified to allow communications in deep space. The Dragon will be capable of operating autonomously throughout the whole flight, but the passengers will be trained in emergency procedures.  The mission would 'do a long loop around the moon' and would take about a week.Musk says it will 'skim the surface of the moon, go quite a bit further out into deep space' and then return to Earth. The total flight would go about 300,000 to 400,000 miles into space.         The system is a complex network of machinery, pipes, tanks and sensors that work together to provide astronauts with air and other essentials. SpaceX built a test version of its Crew Dragon (pictured) solely for evaluation of the life support systemThe mission will use one of SpaceX's Dragon capsules, which will be modified to allow communications in deep space.Musk said it would be roughly the cost of a crewed mission to the International Space Station, and that other flight crews have already expressed interest in later flights.'This presents an opportunity for humans to return to deep space for the first time in 45 years and they will travel faster and further into the Solar System than any before them,' SpaceX said.         Engineers evaluate the ECLSS system designed for Crew Dragon missions.The mission would 'do a long loop around the moon' and would take about a week.'It would skim the surface of the moon, go quite a bit further out into deep space' and then return to Earth, Musk said.'There is some risk here,' he said, adding the hopeful passengers are not 'naive' about the dangers. The agency also revealed its plans for a fly-by of Jupiter, and the exploration of an asteroid.China conducted its first crewed space mission in 2003, and has made steady progress in the short time since.The country has staged a spacewalk, and landed a rover on the moon in 2013, marking the first time humans had soft landed anything on the moon since the 1970s.A fully functioning, permanently crewed space station is on course to begin operations six years from now and is slated to run for at least a decade.
