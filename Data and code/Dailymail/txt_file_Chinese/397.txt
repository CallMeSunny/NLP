China has finished building a solar farm that is designed to look like pandas.Panda Green Energy Group, the company behind the project, said the power station was connected to the grid on June 29 and they were planning 100 more of these bear-shaped farms in China and abroad.The Panda Solar, located in Datong, northern China's Shanxi Province, is said to cost 350 million yuan (£40 million) to construct.                The solar farm has been built in China by Hong Kong-based Panda Green Energy Group       The energy plant, located in Datong, China's Shanxi Province, cost £40 million to build         Giant panda is dubbed the national treasure by the Chinese, who are very proud of the animal    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Circus tiger is forced to ride a HORSE during a show in...

  CHINA'S EFFORT IN GREEN ENERGY   China has vowed to be a global leader in renewable energy.Last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed the importance of developing clean energy to the nation's environmental officials, reported Xinhua News Agency.  President Xi vowed that China would follow the policy of energy conservation and environmental protection strictly.He also said Beijing had taken 'a series of measures' to increase its effort in sustainable development.President Xi made the remarks in a letter to the Eighth Clean Energy Ministerial and the Second Mission Innovation Ministerial, which opened on June 7.  People's Daily Online, China's state newspaper, shared an aerial video of the impressive solar park today.The footage shows solar panels forming the silhouettes of two giant pandas.Xinhua News Agency said in an earlier report that the two pandas were supposed to be a family.The black part of the pandas is composed of monocrystalline silicon - the base material for silicon chips - while the grey and white part are thin film solar cells.In an interview with Reuters, Li Yuan, the Chief Executive of Panda Green Energy, said: 'The plant required an investment of 350 million yuan (£40 million), and it would require investment of £2.3 billion for 100 such plants.' When the panda solar farm is fully completed, it would have a capacity of 100MW - enough to power around 16,400 homes - according Hong Kong-based Panda Green Energy Group. If put to use for 25 years, the plant is expected to generate 3.2 billion kWh of solar energy.That means it could save more than one million tons of coal, which is the main source of energy as well as the main source of pollution in China.Construction of the panda solar farm began last November. Half of the farm, about 248 acres, has been completed and put to use.          Half of the farm, about 248 acres, has been completed and was connected to the grip in June         The plant also has an administrative building (pictured), which is situated next to the solar farmThe innovative farm has been recognised by the United Nations Development Programme, which launched a global campaign to promote the solar farm together with China Merchants New Energy, the mother company of Panda Green Energy.The farm is set to provide solar energy to countries and regions along China's 'Belt and Road' routes, which is a nation-wide initiative aimed to connect China to the Europe via central Asia.Apparently, Panda Green Energy also plans to build panda power stations in Canada, Australia, Germany and Italy.         Panda Green Energy Group is planning 100 more of these bear-shaped farms around the world         Hundreds of solar panels form the silhouettes of two giant pandas in the power farm in Shaanxi         Panda Solar has combined the image of the lovely bear with an effort to develop green energy
