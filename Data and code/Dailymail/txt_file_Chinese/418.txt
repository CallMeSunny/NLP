 Speaking through a Mandarin interpreter, Mr Chen told court that he was in the store holding his 18-month-old son when he clashed with Mr Tai outside the freezer room.'He stared at me, saying, "you are stupid, and you are mental". I sworeback to him', Mr Chen said.Later, outside the supermarket, Mr Chen said he demanded an apology from Mr Tai, but was 'smacked in the face' after pointing at him.         Wai-Yu Tai, 39, is accused of joining in the car park brawl using a broom as a weapon'I saw his wife come over with broom in her hand, and she hit me with that', Mr Chen said.'As a result my head was bleeding and I fell on the ground, and then more people came over and they stamp on me, front and back and all over... my face was covered in blood.'Cross-examined by Julian King, defending, Mr Chen admitted pushing Mrs Tai inside the store, and that after the initial confrontation he had been escorted outside by security, where he handed his son to his wife so he could confront Mr Tai.He also admitted that at one point outside he had 'escaped' the melee, picked up a broom, gone after Mr Tai with it, and had to be restrained again by security.'You started this incident, didn't you?', Mr King said. 'I don't think so', Mr Chen said.'Unfortunately for you you came off worse when you fell over and hit your head.''I don't believe that', Mr Chen said.Mr Chen suffered a cut to his forehead which needed sutures, as well as wounds to the cheek and elbow.Giving evidence in his defence, Mr Tai said: 'I was attacked aggressively...I genuinely believed I was defending myself.'Mrs Tai said in her defence: 'I just protect my family, I was worried they would get hurt. I just saw a broom nearby... I grabbed it and tried to use it to separate them.'
