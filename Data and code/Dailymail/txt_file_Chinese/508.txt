 Changmiao became a nun at the age of 15. She has been the Master of Hailian Temple in Ganzhou since 1993.Her children range from three months old to 37 years old in age. More than 20 of them are now grown-ups.Some of them have decided to choose Buddhism as their career while others were enrolled by distinguished Chinese universities, including Peking University, reported China Daily.         Five-year-old Yanru (above) plays in the temple. She is one of the girls Changmiao has taken in         Yanru offers to clean the kneeling pads in the temple before an evening praying session startsAccording to the report, the benevolent woman adopted her first daughter in 1980 when she found her the newborn child outside of the temple one night.The nun recalled that the baby girl had been left abandoned on the side of the road and ants had crawled all over her body. Onlookers gathered to see the infant, but none of them offered to help her.Changmiao decided to take in the baby and raise her.         Yanlin (above), one of Changmiao's daughters, is seen holding her pet puppy in the temple         Nine-year-old Yanlun (left) helps Yanlin (right), also nine, with her homework after school         Master Changmiao encouraged her children to write inspirational quotes on the blackboardFor each child Changmiao adopted, she taught them to appreciate life and help the others from an early age.The children were taught to take turns at cleaning the temple the best they could. They were also taught to help each other's schoolwork as much as possible. A blackboard was placed by the gate of the temple. Changmiao encouraged her children to write inspirational quotes on the blackboard in order to teach them to live their lives with a graceful attitude. The master nun now lives with eight children in the temple, including five-year-old Yanru, nine-year-old Yanlun and nine-year-old Yanlin. Changmiao told a reporter: 'When the children grow up, I always send them to school and give them opportunities to receive education like their peers.'The woman said her biggest wish was to establish an orphanage so that she could provide a 'warm home' for more abandoned babies.She also said that she hopes none parents in the world would abandon their child regardless of their gender or health condition. SMALL BABIES, BIG SOCIAL ISSUE: CHINA'S ABANDONED INFANTS            Around 270 babies are abandoned by their parents in China every day, reports saidIt's been estimated that nearly 300 babies are abandoned by their parents in China every day - or 100,000 every year - according to a report by Xinhua in 2015. More than 80 per cent of abandoned babies in China were born with disabilities or illnesses, said Zhang Wenjuan from Beijing Juvenile Legal Aid and Research Centre to Minsheng Weekly.A survey carried out by the centre in 2012 showed that many sick or disabled babies had been deserted in busy places such as the hospital; and this meant that their parents had hoped them to be found and carry on living. Zhang said it was possible that many of the babies' parents would not be able to afford the potential medical bills for their children. Thus, the large number of abandoned babies actually reflected the lack of medical welfare from the government.China's criminal law requires the police to set up a case for each abandoned baby, but in reality few of these children had got the attention from the authority and their parents had not been punished accordingly, according to Zhang.Many Chinese cities have established dedicated drop-off points known as 'baby safety islands' for parents to leave their children if they feel they could no longer take care of them.
