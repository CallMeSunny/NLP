Spurned wives are going to elaborate and expensive lengths to drive a wedge between cheating husbands and their mistresses.A number of consultancies have sprung up in China for women who know their husbands are cheating but do not want to end their relationship. Instead, they are paying up to $150,000 for 'marriage consultants' who drive away mistresses using an arsenal of bizarre techniques, the LA Times reported.         Spurned: Jilted wives are forking out thousands of dollars to keep their husbands faithful (stock photo)         Expert: Shu Xin runs a Shanghai-based company that specialises in mistress huntingOne of the Chinese firms specialising in 'mistress disposal' is Changzhou Sincere Heart Marriage and Family Consulting, run by 30-year-old Zhu Lifei. Mr Zhu told the LA Times how his firm would sabotage cheating relationships using a variety of weird and wonderful approaches. His 23 staff - known variously as affairs doctors, mistress hunters or splitting specialists - would first try conventional means to get rid of a mistress. This included staging confrontations between the mistress and the spurned wife.          Elaborate: The Chinese firms are employing crafty and unconventional tactics to drive away mistresses. The picture above is not related to the firm's activities         Jilted: Rather than run the financial risk of splitting up with their husbands, many wives prefer to drive mistresses away. The picture above is not related to the firm's activitiesIf the conventional approach failed, the firm would get a little more creative. A wealthy fake suitor might approach the mistress and try to pry her away using luxury items and expensive gifts.In one scenario, fake loan sharks were sent to a mistresses apartment, with a mystery auctioneer swooping in to halt the confrontation and sweep the woman off her feet. The firm even staged a mock car accident so a husband would feel bad for his jilted wife, who was covered head to toe in chicken's blood. Other tactics involve exposing extramarital affairs in local media and giving the wife a makeover to make her more attractive.Mr Shu Xin runs the Shanghai-based Weiqing company, a similar outfit that also specialises in mistress hunting. He told the Straits Times how he would manufacture scenarios to approach and confront a mistress. 'If the mistress goes to a park, to the supermarket or to work, I will ''happen'' to meet her,' he said.'And even if she is the stay-at-home sort, I can claim I have a leak in my apartment and ask for her help. We always find a way to initiate contact.'         Determined: Mistress hunter Shu Xin (pictured centre) runs a 300-strong company that specialises in keeping married couples together         Cheater: If a straight-up confrontation doesn't work, the firm might try other tactics such as going to the local media. The picture above is not related to the firm's activitiesIt was typically women who sought the services of such firms, although Mr Zhu said he would occasionally work for men.The demand for services seemed to be driven by the desire of wealthy couples to avoid costly and humiliating divorces. While many were critical of the tactics employed by Mr Zhu's firm, he told the LA Times that he saw himself as something of a moral crusader. 'We are fighting for justice,' the qualified marriage counsellor said.For him, the quest to keep married couples together was something he took personally. He added: 'When I get phone calls, someone is cheating, someone is splitting.'My heart is tired.'
