China is preparing to unveil the world's largest telescope which is due to be put into operation at the end of September. Construction of the Five Hundred Metre Apeture Spherical Telescope, or FAST, has entered its final phase in Pingtang County, China's Guizhou province, reports the People's Daily Online. The giant dish, which took five years to build, is the size of 30 football fields, measuring 1,640 feet in diameter. The Chinese authority relocated 8,000 residents from the area to make room for the ambitious equipment, built to boost the global hunt for extra-terrestrial life.         From the beginning: The assembly site of the Five-Hundred Metre Apeture Spherical Telescope was seen in July, 2015         As time goes on: Panels were added to the shell of the telescope with 4,450 panels needed for completion in November, 2015         Almost complete: More panels were put in place to the telescope which helps search for extra terrestrial life in April, 2016         That's a big telescope! The Five Hundred Metre Aperture Spherical Telescope covers the space of 1,640 feet. The picture was taken on September 7   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Obama warns China to give up its claim to the whole of the...

The new rule will come into effect on September 25, according to the local Qiannan Observatory. FAST requires radio silence within a 10-kilometre radius (six miles). The new regulation bans activities such as hunting, wood gathering and land reclamation in the core area and also prohibits construction of irrelevant projects. Those found constructing irrelevant projects will be fined 100,000 yuan (£11,249). Construction of FAST began in March 2011 at a cost of 1.2 billion yuan (£134.9 million). Once fully working, FAST aims to search for signals to understand the origin of the universe and also boost the global hunt for extra-terrestrial life.The last of the 4,450 panels was put in place at the site on July 3 and a ceremony was held with balloons released from inside the telescope.          It's big!

With its sensitive telescope, it can detect weaker radio signals.  It is also due to be used to study the Milky Way in more detail and look for the first shining stars.Despite its end of September start-date, the telescope will need an adjustment period. Peng Bo, director of the NAO Radio Astronomy Technology Laborator told reporters: 'In the first two or three years after its completion, the telescope will undergo further adjustment, and during that period Chinese scientists will use it for early-stage research.After that, it will be open to scientists worldwide' According to Peng, scientists can also carry out observation in other cities such as Beijing, more than 2,000 kilometers from the telescope site. Wang Qiming, chief technologist of the FAST project told reporters: 'Most of the technology and materials are domestically made. Among the 7 FAST receivers, five were domestically made and another two were co-produced by Chinese, Australian and American institutions. Zheng Xiaonian, deputy head of the National Astronomical Observation under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which built the telescope says it will be the global leader for the next 10 to 20 years. He told reporters that the project has the potential to search for more strange objects to better understand the origin of the universe and boost the global hunt for extra-terrestrial life.           more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  MP Charles Walker says 'ITV should stop making Jeremy Kyle Show'       Watch video  Nigel Farage defends where Brexit Party funding is coming from       Watch video  Student snatches the weave off his substitute teacher in AL       Watch video  Felicity Huffman arrives to court and is expected to plead guilty           Watch video  Lorry swerves into car in the left-hand lane on the M1       Watch video  IKEA advertise a kitchen area by putting it at monkeys disposal       Watch video  'We have to deliver Brexit urgently': Andrea Leadsom       Watch video  Shaman Durek explains his teachings and philosophy           Watch video  Kerri-Anne Kennerley unleashes on Bill Shorten       Watch video  Trump says it would be mistake if Iran do anything against U.S.       Watch video  Nigel Farage and New European editor Matt Kelly clash over Brexit       Watch video  Fergus Kenny blasted by Jeremy Kyle during show broadcast in 2016

WE COULD FIND ALIEN LIFE IN THE NEXT 10 TO 20 YEARS, SAYS NASA   There at least 200 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy – and now NASA officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one.During a talk in Washington last year, the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade.'We are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for NASA.'We know where to look, we know how to look, and in most cases we have the technology.' Residents within three miles of the site were forced to relocate and were given a 12,000 Yuan (£1,288) subsidy, with some getting extra financial support for housing. It took the Chinese scientists as long as 17 years to find a hollow in the country large enough to accommodate the dish.The new telescope will overtake the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico to become the world's largest radio telescope.  'FAST' marks the biggest investment in astronomy by China as it continues to invest in its own space programme.The country hopes to have its own space station by around 2020 and in the future conduct a manned mission to the moon.The search for extra-terrestrial life is a worldwide project.Last year, a new $100m project by Breakthough Initiative was launched using two of the world's biggest telescopes to scour through one million of the closest stars to Earth for signals sent out by intelligent life.The project will cover 10 times more sky and be 50 times more sensitive than previous searches.The latest data collected by NASA and other space agencies suggests there could be as many as 40 billion potentially habitable planets in our galaxy.Experts say that if a civilisation was broadcasting signals with the power of common aircraft radar from one of the 1,000 nearest stars to Earth, the telescopes used in the project could detect them.
