 A spokesperson from Touch had said that the company would replace the 'critical parts' of the sex dolls for every new customer.However in a social media post today, the start-up company announced that it had decided to shut down the app.The company said it had been investigated and fined by the authorities. Touch apologised for causing 'negative social influence' in the lead up to the 'two sessions', the most important annual political meetings for the Communist Party of China.The Chinese central government has apparently stepped up its censorship of public opinions as it prepares for the 'two sessions', which are set to be held in Beijing later this year. The 'two sessions' stand for the annual plenary sessions of the National People’s Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. Touch also explained that when it started developing the app six months ago, the company's goal was to help more people experience fun and introduce the concept of sex dolls to the general public.The company said it would strive to step up its social responsibility in the future and explore the fun of life 'in a positive way'.       Touch, a company based in Fujian, south-east China, launched its service in the Chinese capital on September 14.The company required customers to pay a deposit of 8,000 yuan (£914) before hiring a life-size sex doll for 298 yuan (£34) a day. The dolls would be delivered to the customer's address.A spokesperson of Touch told Sina.com last week that the service was aimed at young white-collar workers aged from 20 to 35 years old.The sex dolls were set in five nationalities featuring Chinese, Russian, Korean, and Hong Kong versions, as well as a copy of Wonder Woman who came armed with sword and shield.All silicone sex dolls were full adult size and weighed at 29.8kg (4.7 stone).They were also equipped with voice and heating function.Customers could customise the doll's hair styles, eye colour and skin colour. In addition, they could pay to upgrade the doll so it would come with accoutrements like handcuffs and whips.Special costumes such as nurse and school uniform were at an additional cost of 35 yuan (£4).               (From left to right) The Touch app offers sharing sex doll models themed after Hong Kong, Russia, Greece, Korea and Paradise Island              Clients can choose their favourite hair styles, eye colour and skin colour for free (left). For additional upgrade, costumes and accoutrements are at additional costs (right)At the app's launch, the spokesperson also told the reporter that all sex dolls would be sanitised by professional cleaners for five times for every new customer. The company also guaranteed to change the doll's 'critical parts' every time after it is used.The market price of a life-size silicone sex doll is up to 10,000 yuan (£1,142) in China, according to the company.According to hksilicon.com, Touch had around 53 million users on its app and 45 per cent of them were people in their 20s.It was said that 30 per cent of their customers were female.The app was available to be downloaded in Apple's app store on September 11, and it contained online forums and a shopping page for sex toys.Users of Weibo, a Twitter-like social media site, were apparently worrying about the hygiene issues of the sharing sex dolls when the app was revealed.'What if the sex dolls got infected with AIDS?' One user, called 'puntielim', asked.'So this is not disposable?' Queried web user 'ariesscorpio', who was surprised that the dolls would be cleaned and reused.Some other people took it as a joke and asked for a male version of sex dolls.'Kuailiaoba' commented: 'When is sharing boyfriend coming? That's a bit of gender inequality, is it?'And '1346_th' questioned what else is left to share in the Chinese market.
