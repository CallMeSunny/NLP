The full score is 100.Questions are set to cover basic information such as family members' birthdays, anniversary dates and food preferences.It starts with simple questions such as 'When is your partner's parents' birthday?' and 'What is your partner's favourite food?'It then continues on to in-depth questions, which require longer answers.One of the questions asks: 'What responsibility did you take up in this family? What did you do good and what did you do bad?'Another one asks: 'What is marriage and family to you?'           The husband and wife must fail the test together for their divorce application to be consideredMagistrate Wang told the reporter that the examination was aimed to identify the problem and differences between the couple.Commenting on the couple whose divorce application was rejected, Magistrate Wang said: 'It seems the husband is addicted to gambling and rude to his spouse. He also shows a lack of responsibility to the family.'But the magistrate believed the couple was still in love based on the high marks they had achieved.He also added that the woman appeared to be calmer than before after taking the exam.Candidates who achieve scores above 60 would be considered as being responsible to the family; and those achieved below 60 indicated the marriage is at the verge of breaking up.However, Magistrate Wang did not state how to standardise the marking scheme.
