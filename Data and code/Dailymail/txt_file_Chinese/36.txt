China has announced that it will soon start the process of building its orbital space station, sooner than previously thought. The China Manned Space Engineering Office (CMSEO) will be sending the first module of the Chinese Space Station (CSS) to the launch site at Wenchang Space Launch Center in the second half of this year in preparations for the space station missions, according to state-run Xinhua News Agency on Monday.The key module and experiment modules are currently under development and will be carried by the new Long March-5B heavy-lift rocket, which will be tested in the first half of 2019, the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALVT) confirmed on Tuesday.          The heavy-lift carrier rocket Long March-5 in transit at the Wenchang Space Launch Center in south China's Hainan province on October 2016. China has announced that it will soon start the process of building its orbital space station, sooner than previously thought         Astronauts Nie Haisheng (left) and Liu Wang exit from a re-entry capsule during a wilderness survival training in the Badain Jaran Desert in northwest China's Gansu province last May. Astronauts are currently being recruited and trained for the initial space station missions   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       'Y'all know it's time for Chinese miracle': Beijing uses an...

 The Long March-5B is a variant of the Long March 5, China's most powerful rocket, which launched in July 2017 but ended in failure following a malfunction shortly after take-off.Astronauts are currently being recruited and trained for the initial missions, with drills and tests scheduled for the second half of 2019, Xinhua added. The space station is expected to be fully operational by 2022 and is designed to orbit for about 15 years, according to the China Academy of Space Technology, the contractor for the station's development and construction. The Chinese Space Station, though smaller than the International Space Station, will consist of three modules – a main cabin and two lab modules – and will be able to accommodate three astronauts working simultaneously.          China's space lab Tiangong-2 is carried by a Long March-2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in 2016. The space station is due to be de-orbited after July this year         China's first cargo spacecraft, the Tianzhou-1, separating from Tiangong-2 space lab in September 2017. The Chinese Space Station is expected to be fully operational by 2022 The station will host large-scale scientific research into space life science, biotechnology and will be open to international cooperation once it is in operation, the CMSEO said.  China's current space station, Tiangong-2 space lab, was launched in 2016 and is due to be de-orbited after July this year.  China has been opening up to international cooperation, agreeing with the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs to develop opportunities for scientists from around the world to carry out research on board the Chinese space station, according to South China Morning Post. In January, a Chinese spacecraft has become the first to land on the far side of the moon, marking an important step in the country's space exploration goals.
