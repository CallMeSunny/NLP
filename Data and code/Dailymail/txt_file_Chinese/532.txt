A Chinese drone maker has revealed a giant quadcopter big enough to fit a passenger will be buzzing through the Dubai skyline in July. Dubbed EHang 184, the drone is described as the world's first 'Autonomous Aerial Vehicle' for transporting people. The rider punches in a destination on a touch screen in front of the passenger seat, then the drone would fly there automatically.  Scroll down for video         EHang is building the world's first 'Autonomous Aerial Vehicle' for transporting people. The head of Dubai's Roads & Transportation Agency announced at the World Government Summit on Monday that the drone would be flying by July  Mattar al-Tayer, the head of Dubai's Roads & Transportation Agency, made the announcement about it flight in Dubai today at the World Government Summit. 'You know how it feels to sit in a Ferrari? This is 10 times better,' George Yan, co-founder of Ehang said in an interview with DailyMail.com last year. Unveiled at CES in Las Vegas last year, the all-electric vehicle has four arms with a total of eight propellers at the end.  The company says the 184 is autonomous, so all the passenger has to do is enter in their destination in the smartphone app, sit back, and let the drone take over. Mattar al-Tayer, the head of Dubai's Roads & Transportation Agency, made the announcement about the drone being ready in July at the World Government Summit on Monday.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 2 Next       Never run out of power again: New battery technology could...

 The drone, which has a half-hour flight time, will be monitored remotely by a control room on the ground.  There's no option to take control of the 184 remotely. The cockpit is empty, apart from a stand to place a smartphone or tablet and a cup holder.'I think in all of us there is that little kid in all of us that says I want to fly,' said Yan. 'I don’t want to get a pilot license after five or 10 hours of flying, I want to do it right away. We’re making that dream happen.' 'Everything is calculated in the backend to pick the most optimal route for you, so there is no collision with the other drones flying,' said Yan.'On the drone itself we have built pretty sophisticated back up services so if another system fails then another will take over.'In the event of an emergency, passengers can also elect to halt flight and simply hover in the air.The EHang 184, which was named for ‘one’ passenger, ‘eight’ propellers, and ‘four’ arms. When it's not in use, it can be folded up so that it can be stored away more easily.EHang said the vehicle is primarily designed for traveling short-to-medium distances — around 10 miles — and will fly at around 60 miles per hour.                 'I think in all of us there is that little kid in all of us that says I want to fly,' said founder George Yan.

The 184 provides a viable solution to the many challenges the transportation industry faces in a safe and energy efficient way,' said EHang CEO Huazhi Hu. 'I truly believe that EHang will make a global impact across dozens of industries beyond personal travel. 'The 184 is evocative of a future we've always dreamed of and is primed to alter the very fundamentals of the way we get around.'  As well as having to work in the confines of UAV laws, there is also the issue of trust. Would anyone ever trust a drone to fly them to a destination?'If you roll the timeline back to 100 years you will see that when we went from horse and carriage to vehicles people had the same concerns of whether you could trust it to take you from A to B,' said Yan.'If you look out the cars out there and unmanned vehicles, you can understand that we can make these technology breakthrough. You just have to start somewhere.'   THE DRONE TAXI: WHAT FLYING  IN THE 184 WIL BE LIKE The fully ready-to-fly 184 is a manned drone capable of automatically carrying a passenger through the air, simply by entering a destination into its accompanying smartphone app.The 184 uses multiple independent flight control systems to automatically navigate passengers from point A to point B. These systems combine real-time data collected from sensors throughout the flight and automatically plot the fastest and safest route to carry passengers to their destinations.The EHang 184 has built in reinforcements for all flight systems, so that in the unlikely event that a component does fail, multiple backups are already in place to seamlessly take over.          The fully ready-to-fly 184 is a manned drone capable of automatically carrying a passenger through the air, simply by entering a destination into its accompanying smartphone app         The 184 uses multiple independent flight control systems to automatically navigate passengers from point A to point B.EHang’s independently developed Fail-Safe System ensures that if any components malfunction, or if there’s damage while the AAV is in-flight (i.e. from a bird), the aircraft will immediately begin taking the necessary precautions to ensure safety. The 184’s Fail-Safe System automatically evaluates the damage and determines whether the AAV will need to land to ensure its passenger’s safety.The EHang 184 AAV flight control systems have multiple sets of sensors that provide the drone a constant stream of real-time data.The 184’s communication system was also designed with a safety guarantee: every system is encrypted, and each AAV comes with an independent key.In the event of an emergency, passengers can elect to halt flight and simply hover in the air with just one click.          'The fully ready-to-fly 184 is a manned drone capable of automatically carrying a passenger through the air, simply by entering a destination into its accompanying smartphone app,' the firm saysEHang will also have a command center that employs people to make sure everything is safe — sort of like an air traffic controller at an airport. The command center will monitor every 184 in the air 24/7 and the company plans integrate with existing air traffic controller operations. The command center would, for example, make sure that a 184 doesn't take off in extreme weather conditions. EHang did not respond to a request for comment. In May, authorities in Nevada announced they would partner with EHang to test the 184.                No official launch date has been set, but the company said commercialization will begin in a few months. EHang will first launch in the China and set up a command center there, where it will employ around 300 people, but the US isn't far behind              The EHang 184, was named for ‘one’ passenger, ‘eight’ propellers, and ‘four’ arms.
