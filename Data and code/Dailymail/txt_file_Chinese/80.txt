An opinion piece appearing on two state-backed media sites out of China has called for US brands to share profits stemming from strong sales in the country, as it states  Chinese organizations 'have experienced big losses' due to President Donald Trump's trade war.The article specifically calls out Apple, which has long benefited from less expensive production costs of China and reported a 19 percent increase to sales in the greater China region in its latest quarterly report, through June 30.The increase brought Apple's sales in China to $9.6 billion. 'The eye-catching success achieved in the Chinese market may provoke nationalist sentiment if US President Donald Trump's recently adopted protectionist measures hit Chinese companies hard,' Hu Weijia wrote in the piece. Trump's administration announced on Wednesday that it would considered raising levies on Chinese imports on $200 billion worth of products to up to 25 percent, to which China responded with its own proposal for tariffs at roughly the same percentages.Trump reportedly told Apple CEO Tim Cook that iPhones would be safe from US levies. Weijia's article was first published by the Global Times and then appeared again in People's Daily on Tuesday.Scroll down for video          An opinion piece appearing on two state-backed media sites out of China has called for US brands, namely Apple, to share profits stemming from strong sales in the country; Chinese President Xi Jinping is seen here attending a meeting with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the Great Hall of the People on June 14 in Beijing, China       'In an increasingly interconnected world, Apple is a particularly good example of global manufacturing,' Weijia wrote.'China now serves as a key production and processing base for Apple. Many Chinese companies have been included in Apple's production chain to provide parts and components or assembly work. This has allowed Apple to benefit from China's ample supply of cheap labor.'The author noted that China has also benefited through this arrangement due to job creation, so the country isn't likely to close its doors to the tech giant, but cited a statistic that 'Chinese processors only get 1.8 percent of the total profits created by the [iPhone].'         Apple, which recently became the first US public company to hit a $1 trillion valuation, saw a 19 percent increase in sales in the greater China region in quarter three, reporting $9.6 billion in Chinese sales through June 30'[I]f Apple wants to continue raking in enormous profits from the Chinese markets amid trade tensions, the company needs to do more to share the economic cake with local Chinese people,' Weijia wrote.How the writer would like Apple to do that was not clear.Last week, China outlined how it would impose tariffs ranging from 5-25 percent on four different categories encompassing about $60 billion of US goods, if pressed by the Trump administration, CNBC reported.'The implementation date of the taxation measures will be subject to the actions of the US, and China reserves the right to continue to introduce other countermeasures,' China's Ministry of Commerce said in a release on its website, according to a translation.'Any unilateral threat or blackmail will only lead to intensification of conflicts and damage to the interests of all parties.'

 The White House responded on Friday, through Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.'Instead of retaliating, China should address the longstanding concerns about its unfair trading practices, many of which are laid out in USTRs 301 report,' she said.The piece by Weijia portrayed things differently, however.'It seems US companies doing business in China are the biggest winners from China-US trade,' Weihia wrote.'The Chinese market is vital for many top US brands, giving Beijing more leeway to play hardball in the trade conflict.'Apple, which recently became the first US public company to hit a $1 trillion valuation, according to CNBC, declined to provide comment.         US President Donald Trump reportedly told Apple CEO Tim Cook that iPhones would be safe from US levies; Trump is seen here speaking during a meeting with inner city pastors in the Cabinet Room of the White House on August 1 in Washington, DC
