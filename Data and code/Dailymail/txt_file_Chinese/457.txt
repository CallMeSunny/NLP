 In the footage, ripples almost looking like crashing waves can be seen in the distance. According to CGTN, the wave effect occurs when light rays penetrate air layers of a different density. They then reflect to show an image of far away objects. This is often referred to as a 'Fata Morgana'.          The Flaming Mountains are located in Turpan, China's Xinjiang province (File photo)          The Flaming Mountains is the hottest place in China with temperatures reaching 47 degrees WHAT IS A FATA MORGANA?  A Fata Morgana is a type of mirage that distort distance objects, and can be can be seen on land or sea.It's caused when the sun heats up the atmosphere above the land or oceans, which creates a gradient of temperatures.The air close to the surface is relatively cool and above that are layers of warmer air.When light hits a boundary between two layers of the atmosphere that are different temperatures – and as a result different densities – it bends and travels at a different angle.Our brain assumes that light travels in a straight paths, so when it bends, we think the object is where it would be if the light's path runs straight.  A Fata Morgana is a type of mirage that distort distance objects, and can be can be seen on land or sea.It is a common occurrence in Xinjiang province in the far north west of China. Visitors can see the mirage from May to October when the weather is rather warm. The Flaming Mountains are located in the north of Turpan. It is the hottest place in China with the highest temperature reaching around 47 degrees in summer. The mountains are located in the most inaccessible region on earth and is some 1,550 miles away from the nearest coastline.  The area was made popular thanks to a classical Chinese novel, The Journey to the West which was later turned into a film.
