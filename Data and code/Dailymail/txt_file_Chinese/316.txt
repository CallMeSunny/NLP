 According to Chutian Metropolitan Daily, a female driver was travelling with a companion on G50 Shanghai-Chongqing Expressway on October 3. She made a U-turn near the toll area after realising she had missed the highway exit earlier.She then drove back for about 50 metres (164 ft) on the fast lane and stopped as she attempted to cut three lanes to exit the expressway.The woman apparently realised how dangerous her behaviour was.She could be heard saying: 'This is not right, other drivers are giving signals. What should I do now?'          She attempted to exit the highway at the diversion, circled, four lanes away from her         A truck driver did not notice other cars reducing their speed to avoid accidents         It caused three cars to pile up and crashed towards the woman's car on the fast lane of the roadShe was forced to pull over and wait given the busy traffic and the adverse weather condition.Footage shows that passing-by cars are slowing down their speed with a hazard warning lights on.However a truck did not notice and bumped into a white seven-seat car.It then lead to a pile-up crashing two other cars at the front and hitting the woman's car.'It's over. I am going to take up all the responsibility, I will have to compensate the three drivers,' she said in the video.The driver was given a 200 yuan (£23) fine and 12 demerit points.There were no casualties caused in the incident, according to reports.
