China has started to build a prototype supercomputer which will run ten times faster than the current fastest system. The new machine's calculating capacity will equal to 20 million desktop computer combined.In other words, the world's entire population will need to use calculators together for 320 years to do as many calculations as the supercomputer in one minute.The world's current fastest computer, the Sunway Taihulight was also developed by China.         The Sunway Taihulight is China's supercomputer (File photo)          The new computer is set to be ten times the speed of the current fastest computer (File photo)   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Wen Hair Care users set to win $20,000 payout each after...

 The new supercomputer is currently being developed by the National Research Centre of Parallel Computer Engineering & Technology, state-run Xinhua reported on November 2.  According to CRI English, the supercomputer system has an estimated peak performance of over 1,000 quadrillion calculations per second. This is ten times the speed of the current fastest computer. The news comes just months after China's Sunway Taihulight was unveiled as the world's fastest supercomputer at TOP500, a Supercomputing Conference, in Germany in June.Yang Guangwen, the head of China's National Supercomputing Center, spoke with Xinhua about Taihulight: 'It would take 7.2 billion people using electronic calculators 32 years, or two million desktop computers working together for one minute, to do the same calculation the computer can solve in just 60 seconds.'   The Taihulight uses Chinese-developed ShenWei processors, 'ending any remaining speculation that China would have to rely on Western technology to compete effectively in the upper echelons of supercomputing,' TOP500 said in a statement. Yang Meihong, director of the National Supercomputing centre in Jinan, where the new supercomputer will be installed, said there were challenges with the project: 'It is a test for the effectiveness of China's independently developed technologies.         The Tianhe-1 (pictured) was another supercomputer built by China in 2010         According to reports, China has 167 of the world's top 500 supercomputers (File photo)Supercomputers can help with various tasks including exploration for oil, biological medicine and animation design. According to the International Supercomputing Conference, China has 167 of the world's top 500 supercomputers. Supercomputers are one of a series of technologies targeted by China's ruling Communist Party for development and have received heavy financial support.Such systems are used for weather forecasting, designing nuclear weapons, analyzing oilfields and other specialized purposes.  THE SUNWAY TAIHULIGHT: WORLD'S FASTEST COMPUTER             It would two million desktop computers working together for one minute to match Sunway's performance in one minuteThe Sunway TaihuLight achieves 93 Pflops on the Linpack benchmark, and has a peak performance of 125 Pflops.This means it can run quadrillions of calculations per second.It is now the fastest supercomputer in the world, and marks the first time China has achieved this without the use of US technology.Systems of this kind are used for weather forecasting, designing nuclear weapons, analyzing oilfields and other specialized purposes.The supercomputer may be used to conduct earth system modelling, ocean surface wave modelling, atomistic simulation, and phase-field simulation.
