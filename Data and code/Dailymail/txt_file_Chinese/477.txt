 Neil Grenyer, of Lawrences Auctioneers, said: 'These vases were consigned to us by a couple who inherited them about 30 years ago but never put them on display because of the state they were in.'One of them was shot and the other had hairline cracks in. The worse of the two had a badly broken rim and neck which had previously been repaired using glue.'The damage was post-war and was likely caused by a cleaner who accidentally knocked it over.         The sale is another example of the booming state of the Chinese art market, as the newly-rich Chinese seek to buy back their lost heritage'The owners told me they had always kept them in a coardboard box because they didn't like to look at them.'We catalogued them as a pair of Chinese vases from the Daoguang period in the early 19th century.'We don't believe they were imperial but they were of good quality that the original owners could have had imperial connections.         The couple, who were initially embarrassed about the hairline fractures on the vases, celebrated their good luck with a glass of wine 'We had a lot of interest in them and we sent condition reports to 30 or 40 clients all over the world.'The owners are said to be a couple aged in their 50s.Mr Grenyer said: 'The owner couldn't attend the sale because he was at work but I spoke to him over the phone and he was delighted. This is a very pleasant windfall for them and they celebrated with a glass of wine or two.'
