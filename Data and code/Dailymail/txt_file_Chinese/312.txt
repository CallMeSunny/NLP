 'China is firmly opposed to that and has lodged stern representations with the US,' Hua added, using the term for official diplomatic protests.China's defence ministry warned it would now further strengthen its naval and air defenses.          Patrol: Electronics Technician 3rd Class Drake Sierra, assigned to the guided-missile destroyer USS Chafee, mans a machine gun as the ship arrives in Hong Kong on October 2         China, angered by the mission, responded immediately by dispatching its own navy and air force to warn the US ship (pictured in March) to leave, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said       If confirmed by the United States, it would be the fourth 'freedom of navigation' operation (FONOP) carried out by the US Navy since President Donald Trump took office in January.A US defence ministry spokesman refused to confirm the manoeuvre.But he said all operations are conducted in accordance with international law and 'demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows'.'We are continuing regular FONOPS, as we have routinely done in the past and will continue to do in the future,' Lieutenant Colonel Chris Logan said in a statement.The US Navy regularly carries out such operations to challenge China's vast claims to the South China Sea, where Beijing has turned reefs into militarised artificial islands.Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also claim territory in the vast sea.       The US Navy regularly carries out such operations to challenge China's vast claims to the South China Sea, where Beijing has turned reefs into militarised artificial islands.However, Hua said: 'The Chinese government will continue to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime entitlements. We urge the US to respect Chinese sovereignty and security interests.' The latest US sail-past was not as provocative as previous ones carried out since Trump took office in January.Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Chafee, a guided-missile destroyer, carried out normal maneuvering operations among a string of islets, reefs and shoals over which China has territorial disputes with its neighbors. Next month, Trump makes his first visit to Asia as president, including a stop in China, which he has been pressuring to do more to rein in North Korea. China is North Korea's neighbor and biggest trading partner.Unlike in August, when a U.S. Navy destroyer came within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built up by China in the South China Sea, officials said the destroyer on Tuesday sailed close to but not within that range of the islands.Twelve nautical miles mark internationally recognized territorial limits. Sailing within that range is meant to show the United States does not recognize territorial claims.
