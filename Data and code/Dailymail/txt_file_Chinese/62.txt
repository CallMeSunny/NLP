Chinese workers are constructing a huge high-speed railway bridge over another high-speed railway bridge which remain open. To complete the challenging engineering feat, workers built two bridge sections at an angle and then swinging them into position. The two girders, each weighing 7,000 tonnes and measuring 128 metres (419 feet) long, rotated 19.5 degrees counter-clockwise simultaneously before connecting.

 The enormous overpass on Lianyungang-Zhengjiang railway line was successfully joined last week. The impressive engineer feat was completed in 73 minutes last Thursday night, according to People's Daily Online.Yang Shibin, a supervisor of the construction project, explained the difficulties of the project to the newspaper. Mr Yang said the bridge was situated 'very close' to the elevated Ningqi Railway, and more than 60 trains whiz on it every day.The bridge is also less than half a metre away from high-voltage power lines.Moreover, the two sections form a slope on the bridge with an elevation of three metres (9.8 feet), which made the rotating project unprecedented in China.  To ensure the success of the project, bridge builders worked with professors from multiple universities to calculate the most ideal rotating speed and angle.          China has the world's longest high-speed rail network, expected to reach 18,641 miles in 2020. The bridge is a part of the Lianyungang-Zhengjiang railway line which links the Lianyungang city in Jiangsu province with the Zhenjiang city in Zhejiang province.The railway line in east China is 305.2 kilometres (190 miles) long and is expected to complete next September. It will support high-speed trains with an average operating speed of 250 kilometres per hour (155 miles per hour). China has the world's longest high-speed rail network with more than 20,000 kilometres (12,427 miles) of track. The country expects the network to grow to 30,000 kilometres (18,641 miles) by 2020, according to Xinhua News Agency.Beijing has also been planning to build the world's longest undersea railway tunnel to link the mainland and Taiwan. It was reported in August that scientists were close to confirming the tunnel's design.
