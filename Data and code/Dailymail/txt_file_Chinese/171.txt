 The pensioner from Shanghai was born in 1950 and is 67 years old.  The energetic father-of-one won the competition and was named 'the most fashionable grandpa of Shanghai'.He has since appeared on different reality TV shows in China and impressed audience across the vast country. In one programme, he went head-to-head on the runway with 19-year-old pop singer Wang Junkai, who is a member of TFBOYS, China's answer to the One Direction.                Nearly 40 years went past between these two pictures, but Mr Hu remained youthful              Mr Hu fell in love with music at an early age and nearly became a professional singer in his 20s              Mr Hu (left) went head-to-head on the runway with 19-year-old heartthrob Wang Junkai (right)The 5ft10in man, who looks half of his age, told MailOnline that in real life he has a 37-year-old daughter, but is not yet a grandfather.He said he has a wide range of hobbies which help him stay youthful, including dancing, singing and yoga. He likes belly dance in particular and has been performing in local theatres in his hometown.Mr Hu said everyone has three ages: the biological age, the psychological age and the physical age. The 67-year-old man claimed his psychological age is 'forever 20' and his physical age - the physical condition of his body - is 43.'There is a special machine to help you test your physical age. I test mine every day. It's no joke, it's scientific,' he said.                Mr Hu is pictured with his wife and daughter in 1991 (left) when he was 41 and in 2014 (right)Apart from his age-defying appearance, Mr Hu also has an inspiring life story.He was born as one of seven siblings to a soldier family. His father passed away when he was little and his mother raised him and his brothers and sisters alone.He was a competitive shooter as a teenager and loved singing and dancing.In his 20s, he worked for a state-run textile factory. Because at the time, Chinese citizens, particularly members of the Communist Party, were restricted from doing freelance work or working for themselves, Mr Hu missed the opportunity to become a performing artist which was his real passion.'Many companies wanted me to sing, dance or act in plays for them, but because I'm a member of the Communist Party, I couldn't leave my factory and do it.'Mr Hu learnt English by himself at the age of 40 before changing his career to be an economist.
