 Gales of up to 60 metres per second (134 miles per hour) were recorded at about 9pm last night, according to the Guangxi Meteorological Bureau in a statement on Weibo today.  The extreme weather in Guilin, which usually enjoys a mild climate, prompted the meteorological authority to raise a red gale alert after the gusts reached the highest level on the wind force scale at level 17.   The red alert is the highest level on a four-tier warning system in China, followed by orange, yellow and blue.               Blankets, mattresses, clothing and stationary were seen left strewn about in a student dormitory (left) while hailstones (right) gushed in from broken windows          'Strong convective weather in Guangxi will remain,' the meteorological authority said. 'Residents should stay updated on the latest forecast and weather warnings and stay indoors'         Other clips filmed by residents show curtains being blown away from their flats and balcony items flying about in the heavy downpourThe authority also noted that the rare phenomenon was the strongest winds ever recorded in Guangxi's meteorological history. Most of last night's photos and videos were shot by university students, who went on Chinese social media to describe the damage they were witnessing from their dormitories.  Blankets, mattresses, clothing and stationary were seen left strewn about and scattered on the floor while rainwater gushed in from windowsills. Other clips filmed by residents show curtains being blown away from their flats and balcony items flying about in the heavy downpour.         Social media photos show people holding sizable hailstones in their palms         The extreme weather in Guilin (pictured), which usually enjoys a mild climate, prompted the meteorological authority to raise a red gale alert after the gusts reached the highest level Aftermath photos show uprooted trees, broken glass and window panes lying across roads and footpaths.
