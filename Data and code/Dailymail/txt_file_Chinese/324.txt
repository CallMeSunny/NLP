  HEPATOBLASTOMA: THE FACTS Hepatoblastoma is known to primarily affect children before the age of three. The rare disease is diagnosed in fewer than one in a million children.It's deemed to be a particularly aggressive form of cancer, spreading to other areas of the body very quickly.The cause of the disease is unknown, but there are a few disorders that are known to increase the risk. If caught early, surgery can be used to remove the cancerous cells - but it becomes untreatable when it metastasises. Outlook depends on the extent of the disease, size and location of the tumour and how old the child is. Source: Stanford Children's Health   Yangyang's family come from Yicheng, Hubei Province in central China.The boy was first diagnosed with hepatoblastoma in May, 2016, when his father found him having fever repeatedly.He received three sections of chemotherapy and had two-thirds of his liver removed at a hospital in Shanghai.Doctors then successfully cut the tumour for Yangyang.However, the two-year-old suffered a recurrence of the cancer. Doctors suggested his family arrange a liver transplant for the child.He was transferred to a children's hospital in Beijing in a bid for better treatment.Yangyang's father, Hu Xiaofei, struggled to afford the surgery fees. The child's medical bills have accumulated to one million yuan (£112,215), an astronomical number for Hu Xiaofei, a migrant worker.In order to cover the bills, the family had borrowed roughly 700,000 yuan (£78,550) from family, friends and even loan sharks.Hu told a reporter from Yi Photos that his wife had left the family last November when Yangyang was preparing for his first surgery.         Yangyang's mother allegedly ran away with £22,470 last year after knowing her son's illness         A recurrent hepatoblastoma was found in Yangyang's body during a checkup earlier this yearYangyang's mother also brought with her 200,000 yuan (£22,470) that the family had raised to pay for Yangyang's medical treatment.She returned the money as the family threatened to report her to the police.But she left after a week and never came back.Pictures emerged online showing the young Yangyang crying in the ward and looking for his mother.Hu did not want to tell his son the truth, so he lied to him by saying: 'Mother is out for work now.'         Yangyang has taken over 20 rounds of chemotherapy and nine operations up to dateYangyang is now being taken care by his father and grandparents.The two-year-old has already undergone over 20 rounds of chemotherapy and nine surgical operations.Hu said his son was very optimistic in facing the cancer that he would give him a smile before going in the operation room. Yangyang's story has caught the attention of the Chinese public. A donation page was set up to help the family on September 13.The donation has reached 91 per cent to date, with an aim of 700,000 yuan (£78,592) till December 13.
