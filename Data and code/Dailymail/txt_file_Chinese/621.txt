Chickens don't have ears.'Another user 'YBD' argued: 'It should be the pig because it's not halal food.'A third user 'mo wei xi xia' said: 'It's the cat because it's not a part of China's 12 animal signs.'          The question given to six-year-olds have left thousands of parents in China baffled (file photo)A primary school maths teacher in Jiangsu Province, where the question originated, told a reporter from Pengcheng Evening News that the correct answer should be the chicken. The teacher, surnamed Zhao, said: 'A chicken has two legs, all the other animals have four.'Zhao also said a lot of parents tended to complicate simple questions given to small children.The teacher said: 'Children's logic is different from adults'. Math questions given to first-grade pupils will reflect their logic.'When presented the question, Lu Ting, a mother from Shanghai, told MailOnline that she thought the answer should be chicken 'because it doesn't have teeth'.         A Chinese maths teacher said the answer was the chicken because it had two legs (file photo)Lu, whose daughter is in the second-grade, said the maths questions given to her child were not easy.She said: 'I can't understand many of them, but magically my daughter knows how to answer. 'A maths teacher in Shanghai, who called herself Amy, told MailOnline: 'If we look at the question from the number of legs the animal has, then the answer should be the chicken.'If we are talking about Chinese animal signs, then it's indeed the cat.'However, the teacher added that as long as the pupil could explain his or her choice, the answer should not be deemed wrong.
