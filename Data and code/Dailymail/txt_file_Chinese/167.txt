Federal agents seized over 100 homes in Sacramento this week in what the Justice Department said was part of a sweeping crackdown on a criminal marijuana growing operation funded by criminal gangs based in China.In a two-day sweep that started on Tuesday, the Justice Department said hundreds of federal agents and local police executed search warrants at about 74 homes and two business offices believed to be used for marijuana-growing operations.At the same time, the Justice Department filed civil forfeiture actions against over 100 homes, a legal action allowing the government to confiscate assets if there is probable cause to believe a crime was committed.The investigation, which was begun in 2014, resulted in the seizure of over 60,000 pot plants and over $100,000 in cash.          The investigation, which was begun in 2014, resulted in the seizure of over 60,000 pot plants and over $100,000 in cash.

 The operation announced on Wednesday, however, relates to underground illegal marijuana-growing operations, and not those following California's stringent regulatory and licensing regime.Federal law enforcement officials said in a statement that the criminal organization targeted through the home seizures used foreign funds to purchase the homes in order to use them for growing marijuana.Down payments on the properties were financed by wire transfers from the province of Fujian, China, and the pot that was grown in the homes was later distributed outside California to other parts of the United States, the statement said.         Scott (pictured at the news conference yesterday) said the homes were bought with over $6 million in foreign cash before being converted into marijuana-producing factoriesThe Justice Department said the operation represented one of the largest-ever residential forfeiture efforts in US criminal history.In addition to seizing the homes, the government also seized 61,050 marijuana plants, over $100,000 in cash, more than 440 pounds (200 kg) of processed marijuana and 15 firearms.According to one neighbor in the area, the FBI 'kicked in the door' after arriving outside with 'a lot of units'. The man, who asked to remain anonymous, told CBS13: 'They let all the windows open, they were airing it out for some reason.' US Attorney for the Eastern District of California McGregor Scott said the marijuana grown in the homes was distributed across the country, and particularly to the East Coast. Scott said the homes were bought with over $6 million in foreign cash before being converted into marijuana-producing factories.He added: 'The wired funds would go to an escrow account and then a hard money lender, then they would buy the title through a straw purchaser.'The vast majority of the homes - 85 per cent - were bought through the same realtor.
