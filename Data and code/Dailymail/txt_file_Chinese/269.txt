Apple has removed several apps including Skype, Microsoft Corp's internet phone call and messaging service, from its app store in China after the country's government pointed to violations of local laws.The firm confirmed the move today in a statement to Reuters, after nearly a month of reports that the service had 'disappeared' for users in China. The removal of apps led to complaints from several Chinese users who were unable to pay for Skype's services through Apple, New York Times reported, adding that the disruption started in October.          Apple has removed several apps including Skype, Microsoft Corp's internet phone call and messaging service, from its app store in China after the country's government pointed to violations of local laws, the firm revealed today.

'We have been notified by the Ministry of Public Security that a number of voice over internet protocol apps do not comply with local law, therefore these apps have been removed from the App Store in China,' an Apple spokeswoman told Reuters.Skype is the latest addition to the list of internet platforms, including Alphabet Inc's Google services, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc, which has become inaccessible to Chinese users. In recent years, Beijing has pursued a series of laws and regulations that have raised concerns from foreign companies trying to expand their user base across the country. Last year, the Chinese government regulated online publication to rein in the internet as it perceives the web as a crucial domain for controlling public opinion and eliminating anti-Beijing sentiment. Microsoft did not immediately respond to request for comment. This summer, Apple sparked criticism after removing software from its app store that allowed internet users to skirt China's' Great Firewall.Chinese internet users have for years sought to get around heavy internet restrictions by using foreign virtual private network (VPN) services.

 Earlier this year Beijing decreed that all developers must obtain government licenses to offer VPNs, which allow users to bypass blocks on sites like Facebook and Twitter.This lead to the Apple decision, which some argue is evidence of the firm bowing to China's tightening web censorship. In January, Beijing passed laws seeking to ban all VPNs that are not approved by state regulators.         Skype is the latest addition to the list of internet platforms, including Alphabet Inc's Google services, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc, which has become inaccessible to Chinese users.
