 The couple, from Iffley, Oxfordshire, then spent five weeks travelling 4,500 miles across China before ending up in Hong Kong, and described the trip as an 'extraordinary experience'.'We have both long been interested in issues to do with recent history and international politics,' said artist Phil, 69.

Phil said: 'We were never late once, in eight weeks of travel. It was just superb'.

Phil said that he was never bored on the journey across RussiaAnd Phil said that their eventual arrival in China was the highlight of the trip for him.'China was a place that really, really impressed me,' he said.'Everything is bigger and better there than everywhere else. There's 3,000 to 4,000 years of history, of engineering projects. It's mind-blowing.'It calls itself a communist country, but it's actually one of the most capitalist places you could go to.'And Phil added that he and Emma were particularly taken by the efficiency of all the public transport they took.'We were never late once, in seven weeks of travel. It was just superb,' he said.To capture their expedition Phil, a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, sketched some of their most treasured memories, from a Russian Orthodox Mass to the Hong Kong races.He will now choose the best of his sketches as the basis for larger paintings, which he will work on in his Oxford studio.And he said he and Emma are already planning their next adventure – but would like to keep it more low-key, in either Snowdonia or the Western Highlands of Scotland.
