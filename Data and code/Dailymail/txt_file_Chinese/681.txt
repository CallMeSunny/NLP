 Alex spent his early years in China before moving back to Britain in 2000. He had been a British citizen until 2006 when he switched to be Chinese.The decision has not only paved his way to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but also brought him surprising financial rewards.Jiang Fengcan, a Chinese real estate tycoon from Guangzhou, allegedly shelled out 30 million Yuan (£3.4 million) to fund Alex's equestrian training, according to QQ.com.   Alex said had he chosen to remain British, he 'certainly would never have gained the ground-breaking private funding from Mr Jiang which got me qualified for Beijing [Olympics]'.He added: 'And it is unlikely that I would have been selected for the British Team this year for Rio.'   Alex had represented China in various international competitions, including the Asian Games held in Korea in 2014 where he snapped a silver medal in individual.         Riding high at Rio: Alex Hua Tian becomes the first Olympic equestrian for China after giving up his British nationality to become Chinese. He was pictured competing in the Rio Olympics on August 9 in individual jumping       Olympic dream: Representing China, the ambitious rider finished at eighth in standing and jumping, 11th in cross country and 12th in dressage at the individual eventing competition in RioAlex and his nine-year-old Don Geniro, the youngest horse on the field, finished eighth in Rio, the best result ever for Chinese horsemanship in the Olympics.Two weeks after his final, Alex was still extremely excited.He told MailOnline: '[I am] very proud to have represented my country at my second Olympics, proud of The Don, who tried his guts out, and proud of my support team who have all put blood, sweat and tears into our Olympic Dream.'The determined equestrian, who is the youngest ever event rider to have competed at the Olympics, even changed the nationality of his three horses for the Rio Olympics.He registered his three horses, Harbour Pilot C, Don Geniro and Diamond Sundance, as Chinese last December in preparation for the games, according to sina.com.The soft-spoken man, who runs the Pinfold Stables in Knutsford together with his equestrian girlfriend Sarah Higgins, has always been keen to express his patriotism and loyalty to China.His most famous quote on the Chinese media is: 'I'm Chinese. China is my home.'         Ready for the game: Alex and his horse Don Geniro competed in the Rio Olympics on August 9 representing China       Bright future: The old Etonian is China's first and only Olympic equestrian and is the youngest ever event rider to have competed at the Olympics at the age of 18Alex's father Hua Shan is the son of a war hero and the founder of Dazhong Air, the first private airline company in China, according to toutiao.com.His mother, Sarah Noble, studied Chinese in Britain before moving to Guangzhou for work in the 1980s, during which time she met Shan.Alex spent some of his early years in Beijing, Guangzhou and Hong Kong and showed a potential for equestrian sports.He started receiving training in riding at around four years old when he lived in Beijing.'My passion for horses and equestrian sports has definitely come from my mum who also grew up with horses,' said Alex.          Symbol of China: Patriotic Alex trims the five stars pattern from the Chinese national flags into his horses before each game.

He went on to study at Eton and carried on practising his horse-riding skills.  'In 2005, when I was 15, I was looking to start competing internationally and given the choice by my parents, I decided to ride for China. 'When the Beijing Olympics seemed to be a possibility, it was the time to commit to my original decision. 'This involved me dropping my British passport to take up my Chinese - China does not allow dual nationality.' Interestingly, Alex's brother, Jamie Hua Ming, plays for the Chinese national team in cricket, another quintessentially British sport that is little known in China. Commenting on both his and his brother's sporting career, Alex said: 'If both of these sports have an opportunity to develop in China, more of the Chinese public will also fall in love with them.'         As the only Chinese Olympic rider, Alex said: 'Riding for China has benefitted my career incalculably. It has given me the opportunities that riding for Team GB would never have done'         He also said that he 'certainly would never have gained the ground-breaking private funding from Mr Jiang which got me qualified for Beijing [Olympics]' When asked by a Chinese reporter why Alex had given his British passport, his British mother Sarah said it was his own choice and that 'he has always felt he is Chinese'.Responding to that, Alex said: 'My mother is British but did Chinese at university, met my father in China and has worked in China most of her life. 'I grew up in China until I was 11 and my father is Chinese.'Other than the fact that English is my first language and I was at school here in the UK, it would have been very strange for me to ride for any country other than China.'          Alex of China riding Don Geniro jumps during the eventing team final and individual qualifier in the Rio Olympics              Charming Alex is also a fashion icon in China and is invited to attend catwalk shows. Pictured above, he was seen at Milan Fashion Week in 2012 with Taiwanese actor Eddie Peng (left) and Italian actor Luca Argentero (right)Since his nationality change, Alex has been an inspiring idol to the Chinese public.A hashtag, called 'hegaveupbritishnationality', rocketed to the second trending topic on Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter, just before Alex was about to compete in the jumping final at the Rio Olympics.Chinese media chant his nationalism without reserve, calling him a 'one in a billion' talented rider.Fascinated by his English upbringing, QQ.com, an influential Chinese tabloid news website, has published a feature on Alex with the title 'a lone rider living in British high society'.The article said that Alex practises the 'world's most aristocratic sport' and 'rubs shoulders with the British Royal family'.On the other hand, millions of female fans are smitten with Alex's exotic looks and British demeanours, referring to 6ft 2in man as a true gentleman and their ultimate Prince Charming.With more than 366,000 followers on his Weibo account, the social media darling receives thousands of comments - many from love-struck women - for every post he writes.Under Alex's latest post on August 8 from Rio, one such Weibo user wrote: 'A real prince! A real gentleman! I support you and I was so touched I cried.'Another user commented: 'The horse is handsome, but the person is even more handsome!'A third one posted: 'Thank you for your contribution to your country and the Olympics. Proud of you!'However, some people in China have also voiced doubt on whether or not Alex is 'truly Chinese'.In response to that, the Olympic athlete said: 'I know that there is a part of the Chinese public who don't see me as "full Chinese" - that's because I'm not.'I am half British, half Chinese and very proud to be both. 'Being both has afforded me great opportunities in my life so far and has allowed me to fly the Chinese flag in a very British sport.'
