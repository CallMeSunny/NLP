He warned against a 'cold war' mentality, sending Asian and European markets higher. The Dow Jones also soared after the opening bell on Wall Street. A report from HSBC claimed British exports had benefited from the weak pound while a KPMG retail update found the freezing 'Beast from the East' kept shoppers away from the high street in March.","headline":"FTSE CLOSE: UK stocks jump as China softens its trade war talk; Report hails good news for British exports","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@id":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk#publisher","name":"Daily Mail","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/daily-mail-structured-data-logo.gif","width":"350","height":"60"}},"liveBlogUpdate":[{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"City pundits on today's session","url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-5597873/FTSE-LIVE-UK-stocks-shift-higher-China-softens-trade-talk.html#lc-id-20","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:42:46+01:00","datePublished":"2018-04-10T17:42:46+01:00","articleBody":"<br />Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: 'The jump higher out of the gates in European stocks proved durable. Investors are acting like Chinese President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s \"conciliatory\" speech at a forum in Asia makes a trade war dead on arrival.\n'Although another twist or two in the trade dispute seems likely, it does seem we&rsquo;ve stepped off the road to ruin. The exception was again shares in Russia.\n'The benchmark Micex index has now notched up double-digit losses in just two days. The fact that the new US tariffs target individuals and industries that are not part of Putin&rsquo;s inner circle increases the risk of investing in any Russian company.<br /> <br />'There were some specific beneficiaries of the proposed economic reforms in President Xi&rsquo;s speech. European automakers including Volkswagen, BMW and Peugeot Citroen all saw share prices rise in excess of 2 per cent.\n'Lower import tariffs will cut the cost of purchasing foreign cars for Chinese drivers. Car sales have plateaued in developed markets but there is years of rising demand to take advantage of in China.'\nDavid Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: 'European markets are set to finish higher today after Chinese president Xi Jinping said he is willing to open up the Chinese economy even further.\n'The remarks were made overnight at the Bo&rsquo;ao forum. Traders are taking it as a sign there won&rsquo;t be a full-blown trade war between the US and China, and they are snapping up stocks. <br /> <br />'Mining companies are clawing back some of yesterday&rsquo;s lost ground. The message out of China is towards a more open and liberal mindset in terms of international trade.\n'The second-largest economy in the world is a major importer of raw materials, and should they commit to their pledge to lower trade barriers, it is likely to benefit companies like BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Antofagasta.'","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tanya Jefferies"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@id":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-5597873/FTSE-LIVE-UK-stocks-shift-higher-China-softens-trade-talk.html","@type":"WebPage"},"publisher":{"@id":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk#publisher"},"image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/08/4B00754D00000578-0-image-m-7_1523344600701.jpg"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"FTSE 100 closes up 72.00 points at 7266.75","url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-5597873/FTSE-LIVE-UK-stocks-shift-higher-China-softens-trade-talk.html#lc-id-19","dateModified":"2018-04-10T17:07:45+01:00","datePublished":"2018-04-10T17:07:45+01:00","articleBody":"","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tanya Jefferies"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@id":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-5597873/FTSE-LIVE-UK-stocks-shift-higher-China-softens-trade-talk.html","@type":"WebPage"},"publisher":{"@id":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk#publisher"},"image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/08/4B00754D00000578-0-image-m-7_1523344600701.jpg"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"Thousands of City jobs at risk after Deutsche Bank sacked boss","url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-5597873/FTSE-LIVE-UK-stocks-shift-higher-China-softens-trade-talk.html#lc-id-18","dateModified":"2018-04-10T16:15:02+01:00","datePublished":"2018-04-10T16:15:02+01:00","articleBody":"Thousands of City jobs could be on the block at Deutsche Bank after it fired chief executive John Cryan.\nThe Yorkshireman was forced to quit by his own board amid concerns that his already-brutal programme of cuts does not go far enough.\nHe has been replaced by insider Christian Sewing, who has hinted that the troubled German lender&rsquo;s once-mighty investment bank will be slashed further.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Louise Hill"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@id":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-5597873/FTSE-LIVE-UK-stocks-shift-higher-China-softens-trade-talk.html","@type":"WebPage"},"publisher":{"@id":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk#publisher"},"image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/08/4B00754D00000578-0-image-m-7_1523344600701.jpg"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"Recruiter hails solid growth","url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-5597873/FTSE-LIVE-UK-stocks-shift-higher-China-softens-trade-talk.html#lc-id-17","dateModified":"2018-04-10T16:03:34+01:00","datePublished":"2018-04-10T16:03:34+01:00","articleBody":"Recruitment company Robert Walters enjoyed first quarter success with a 17 per cent increase in recruitment fee revenue it revealed today.\nEurope saw an impressive growth rate of 32 per cent with the biggest growth countries, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands each growing over 35%.\nIn the UK there was significant growth outside of the capital with Manchester, Milton Keynes and St Albans being hailed as standout stars.\nUK Q1 fee income was up 6 per cent at &pound;25.2 million with the economy continuing to shrug off fears of a Brexit-induced hiring freeze.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Louise Hill"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@id":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-5597873/FTSE-LIVE-UK-stocks-shift-higher-China-softens-trade-talk.html","@type":"WebPage"},"publisher":{"@id":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk#publisher"},"image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/08/4B00754D00000578-0-image-m-7_1523344600701.jpg"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"BoE: We helped UK households through financial crisis","url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-5597873/FTSE-LIVE-UK-stocks-shift-higher-China-softens-trade-talk.html#lc-id-16","dateModified":"2018-04-10T15:47:34+01:00","datePublished":"2018-04-10T15:47:34+01:00","articleBody":"Bank of England chiefs have simultaneously lauded their effectiveness in nursing British households through the financial crisis and hinted another rate rise is imminent.\nIn a speech at the University of&nbsp;Melbourne&nbsp;in Australia, the Bank's chief economist Andy Haldane said the average UK family has benefited from a cumulative &pound;90,000 boost to their wealth since the 2008 crisis due to its policies to support the economy.\nThe figure includes the impact of house price rises and stock market climbs.

City pundits on today's session


Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: 'The jump higher out of the gates in European stocks proved durable. Investors are acting like Chinese President Xi Jinping’s "conciliatory" speech at a forum in Asia makes a trade war dead on arrival.
'Although another twist or two in the trade dispute seems likely, it does seem we’ve stepped off the road to ruin. The exception was again shares in Russia.
'The benchmark Micex index has now notched up double-digit losses in just two days. The fact that the new US tariffs target individuals and industries that are not part of Putin’s inner circle increases the risk of investing in any Russian company. 'There were some specific beneficiaries of the proposed economic reforms in President Xi’s speech. European automakers including Volkswagen, BMW and Peugeot Citroen all saw share prices rise in excess of 2 per cent.
'Lower import tariffs will cut the cost of purchasing foreign cars for Chinese drivers. Car sales have plateaued in developed markets but there is years of rising demand to take advantage of in China.'
David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: 'European markets are set to finish higher today after Chinese president Xi Jinping said he is willing to open up the Chinese economy even further.
'The remarks were made overnight at the Bo’ao forum. Traders are taking it as a sign there won’t be a full-blown trade war between the US and China, and they are snapping up stocks.  'Mining companies are clawing back some of yesterday’s lost ground. The message out of China is towards a more open and liberal mindset in terms of international trade.
'The second-largest economy in the world is a major importer of raw materials, and should they commit to their pledge to lower trade barriers, it is likely to benefit companies like BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Antofagasta.'

Thousands of City jobs at risk after Deutsche Bank sacked boss


Thousands of City jobs could be on the block at Deutsche Bank after it fired chief executive John Cryan.
The Yorkshireman was forced to quit by his own board amid concerns that his already-brutal programme of cuts does not go far enough.
He has been replaced by insider Christian Sewing, who has hinted that the troubled German lender’s once-mighty investment bank will be slashed further.

Recruiter hails solid growth


Recruitment company Robert Walters enjoyed first quarter success with a 17 per cent increase in recruitment fee revenue it revealed today.
Europe saw an impressive growth rate of 32 per cent with the biggest growth countries, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands each growing over 35%.
In the UK there was significant growth outside of the capital with Manchester, Milton Keynes and St Albans being hailed as standout stars.
UK Q1 fee income was up 6 per cent at £25.2 million with the economy continuing to shrug off fears of a Brexit-induced hiring freeze.

BoE: We helped UK households through financial crisis


Bank of England chiefs have simultaneously lauded their effectiveness in nursing British households through the financial crisis and hinted another rate rise is imminent.
In a speech at the University of Melbourne in Australia, the Bank's chief economist Andy Haldane said the average UK family has benefited from a cumulative £90,000 boost to their wealth since the 2008 crisis due to its policies to support the economy.
The figure includes the impact of house price rises and stock market climbs. With these stripped out Haldane said it is a more modest but not insignificant £9,000.
'The material loosening of UK monetary policy after 2007 has had a significantly positive effect on employment, income and wealth, without which average living standards in the UK would be materially lower,' Haldane said.

Check in with the afternoon markets


European markets are 'buoyant' according to Connor Campbell of Spread Ex.
He said: 'The European markets remained buoyant in the aftermath of President Xi’s openness-eying speech, with the prospect of some sizeable growth to come from the US session likely to keep the gains going.
'Though it trailed its more ebullient peers, the FTSE still managed a respectable 40 point rise as the day went on, a move that took the UK index back above 7200 and to levels not seen in around a month.
'This came despite a decent showing from the pound; sterling jumped 0.2% against both the dollar and the euro, keeping above $1.415 against the former while knocking on the door of €1.15 against the latter. That’s because the currency got a bit of a boost in the form of some pro-rate hike comments from Ian McCafferty – the gains only weren’t larger due to the MPC member’s already well-known hawkish stance.
'As mentioned, the certain elements of the Eurozone were more than ready to embrace the idea that the US and China are stepping back from the trade war brink. The DAX surged over 140 points, leaving the German index to dance around the 12400 mark for the first time since the middle of March.'

Regulator increases scrutiny of 'big six' accounting firms


The UK's six largest accounting firms are facing a regulatory crackdown after the watchdog said it would "enhance" its monitoring of the sector amid growing criticism of auditing failures.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said the move is meant to avoid instability in the financial sector and "systemic deficiencies" in the networks of the sector's biggest companies - BDO, Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PwC and Grant Thornton.
It plans to focus on "critical" areas including evidence of auditing quality, risk management and controls, financial soundness, values and behaviours as well as leadership and governance.
The watchdog said it had already started work on monitoring risk reporting, contingency planning and IT security across the companies, and plans to report back to the firms on its findings.

Government cracks down on outsourcing contracts in bid to boost small business


The Cabinet Office has announced plans to block companies who do not pay contractors from winning government contracts.
The moves are hoped to help small businesses win more public sector work. The government set a target for a third of all contracts to be with small businesses by 2022.
It follows the collapse of construction firm Carillion and the saga that followed with questions asked about why the government gave public contracts to a firm in such difficulty. 
Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden said: 'This government is listening to the business community and is committed to levelling the playing field for smaller suppliers to win work in the public sector.'

'Looking to 2018, the Board remains confident that the Belvoir Group will benefit from further consolidation within the sector, further integration of our recent acquisitions to deliver additional efficiencies and diversification of property-related services offered through our franchised networks, to ensure a continued increase in shareholder value.'

Import tariff comments caught the ear of markets...


Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at Spread Ex, also reacted to President Xi's market-calming speech.

President Xi provides relief for markets


President Xi has extended an olive branch in the ongoing trade dispute with the US, but will Donald Trump accept it?
Markets have breathed a sigh of relief nonetheless.

Shoppers avoided the high street as Beast from the East tore across UK, report finds


The Beast from the East kept shoppers away from stores in March as people huddled in the warmth of their homes amid the big freeze, figures show.
A report from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and KPMG, covering the final days of February to the end of March, said the period was volatile as the run-up to Easter helped to offset the impact of the "seemingly endless" cold weather on sales.
It said UK retail sales increased by 1.4% on a like-for-like basis compared with March 2017, when they had decreased 1% from the preceding year.
On a total basis, sales rose 2.3% annually in March, against a decline of 0.2% in March 2017.
