China's wealthiest man is throwing his massive fortune behind a plan to launch a rival to the Uefa Champions League and is offering to make Europe's top clubs even richer.Billionaire Wang Jianlin's company is said to be in talks with a number of top clubs about setting up a competition which would give even more money to top clubs like Manchester United, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea, Juventus and Bayern Munich.  The Financial Times said Dalian Wanda Group is said to be in talks with Uefa but is willing to set up a completely separate competition if negotiations break down.         Marco Bogarelli, strategic director of Wanda Sports Holding, said its aim was to get more teams from Europe's 'big five' TV markets - England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France - involved in the elite competition.That would probably mean excluding teams from countries like Scotland, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland and Romania unless they can bring in significant revenue, like for example Glasgow Celtic.Chinese companies have invested billions of pounds in recent years acquiring stakes in European football clubs and in the last 12 months Chinese clubs have also started buying up big-name players like Alex Teixiera, Jackson Martinez and Ezequiel Lavezzi.
