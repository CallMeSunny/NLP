A local council in Sydney's south west received threatening emails from the Chinese Government after refusing to ban a local Chinese newspaper that criticised the Communist Party.The emails, obtained by ABC's 4 Corners, show Chinese Government officials directing the council to ban the Vision China Times to avoid 'embarrassing situations' for China.Maree Ma, who runs the paper, told the program the Vision China Times had applied to be a sponsor of the council's Lunar New Year celebrations in 2018, and was approved before her application was scrapped.'Per the cancellation letter, the reason was due to council wanting to stay with existing media partners,' she said.'However, since then, we have strong reasons to believe that the real reason was due to interference from a foreign government. We are shocked.'Scroll down for video       Maree Ma (pictured right with Ray Williams) runs The Vision China Times out of Sydney. The Chinese consulate requested the Georges River Council ban her paper from sponsoring the area's Lunar New Year celebrations       Footage of a local council meeting held after Ms Ma questioned the decision shows Councillor Sandy Grekas noting there was 'potentially foreign influence' involved in the decision to reject Ms Ma's application to sponsor the festivities.'I keep asking myself and I can't find an answer as to why the decision was not made to accept Vision China Times sponsorship when they clearly comply with our sponsorship policy,' she said.

 Ms Grekas was shut down by Councillor Vince Badalati, who said she was 'really overstepping the mark on this'.         Ms Ma asked the council why she was not approved to sponsor the event, which led to the revelation the decision was made at the request of the Chinese Consul, who said he would not attend when the request was not followedMoments later, the council's General Manager Gail Connolly is seen to stand up and address mayor Kevin Greene directly.She said the acting CEO had advised Council did receive a letter from the Consul General, Gu Xiaojie.'That email said council [should] consider not accepting the sponsorship due to the Vision Times being considered to be politically anti-China,' she said.One email noted Council had received a call from a Mr Tony Wong, who worked for the Consulate: 'to remind us that he would like to keep a friendly relationship between China and New South Wales'.'He wanted to make sure that there were no embarrassing situations this year and re-iterate their position involving anti-China groups,' the email read.A second email was seen showing Mr Wong had called again to remind the Council of their disapproval of the 'anti-Chinese group', and a call was made soon after the council lifted its ban on the Vision Times.'I received a call from the Office of the Chinese Consul General (CCG). The CCG was disappointed that Georges River Council would include anti-Chinese political groups in the Lunar New Year event,' a file note obtained by 4 Corners read.'As a consequence, the CCG will not attend the event.'         Pictured: The Vision China Times was able to sponsor the 2018 event after the interference was revealedThe director general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation said during budget estimates in Canberra that the threat to Australia posed by foreign interference remains at an 'unprecedented level'.'I have made very plain to this committee on previous occasions that the threat from foreign interference and foreign espionage in Australia was running at, what I described then and I describe again, as an unprecedented level,' he said on Monday.Mr Lewis said he does not respond to media shows or reports and does not single out countries that may pose foreign interference risks.'We have a challenge here with foreign interference in Australia,' he told senators.'It comes, as I have said on a number of occasions, from a wide range of sources. I have not been country-specific and I will not be country-specific.'Â          The director general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation said there was an 'unprecedented' threat of foreign interference in Australian government organisations, but would not be country-specific (pictured: the Chinese Consulate in Sydney)
