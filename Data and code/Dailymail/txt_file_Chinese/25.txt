A desperate parent has discovered a storage unit full of baby formula destined for China. A picture posted on social media shows a storage unit filled with more than a hundred containers of Australian baby formula, shipping boxes and tape which were reportedly being sent to China.  'While technically legal the immoral practice of daigou to raid supermarket shelves of baby formula for sale in China has left many families (including mine) scrambling to find stock of particular brands,' wrote the mother.           Desperate mother for baby formula uncovers massive piles bound for China at a storage unitShe self proclaimed to have found one of 'their hidden lairs' at a local Kennard's self storage unit in Petersham, New South Wales. The demand for Australian formula has spiked after the 2008 Chinese milk scandal which saw an estimated 54,000 Chinese babies hospitalised due to contaminated Chinese formula. A person replied to the mother post asking: 'Why aren't baby formula manufacturers selling direct?' Woolworths and Coles currently both have a two-tin baby formula limit for customers due to the popularity of 'daigou shoppers', who bulk buy tins of Australian baby formula to sell for a profit online to China.

 A Woolworths spokesman has said the company had been working hard to ensure customers had access to stock when they need it.'We encourage any parents who find their chosen baby formula is unavailable on the shelves to speak with store management, so we can help get them stock as quickly as possible.'A statement issued by Coles said the store was working with suppliers to find a solution to improve availability.         Another enraged Woolworths shopper slammed a woman for buying trolley loads of baby formula and covering it up with blanket 'Coles is committed to ensuring our customers have access to infant formula and as a result we are limiting sales quantities to two units per customer,' it said.'We are working with our suppliers on solutions to improve availability for customers.'Where formula is unavailable, we encourage customers to speak with their local store manager,' the statement concluded.
