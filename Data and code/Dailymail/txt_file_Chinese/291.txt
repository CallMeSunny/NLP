 Yi Long, whose name is translated to 'One Dragon', is a celebrated Kung Fu fighter in China.According to China.com, he rose to fame after winning the championship of the International Wing Chun Fighting Competition in Foshan in 2008. Since then, Yi Long has been billed 'the most influential sports figure in China'. However, it remains unclear whether or not Yi Long has been a monk or studied in Shaolin Temple, the renowned institute of Chinese Kung Fu.The fight between Yi Long and Sitthichai Sitsongpeenong was apparently the final of a seven-month-long tournament organised by and named after the 30-year-old athlete.           Their fight was held on November 4 after Sitthichai Sitsongpeenong had won a tournament         Yi Long was knocked out by Sitthichai Sitsongpeenong just 70 seconds into the second round         The game has been described as 'humiliating' by Chinese media and Yi Long was criticisedSina.com reported that a total of eight top martial arts athletes from around the world had been invited to fight each other, including MMA fighter Regian Eersel, Muay Thai kickboxers Sitthichai Sitsongpeenong and Enriko Kehl as well as welterweight boxers Saiyok Pumpanmuang and Dzhabar Askerov.Sitthichai Sitsongpeenong, the winner among the eight, was invited to have a duel with Yi Long for a one million yuan (£115,000) prize.In what's been described as a 'humiliating game', Yi Long was knocked out by Sitthichai Sitsongpeenong just 70 seconds into the second round after being repeatedly beaten in the first round, reported Eastday.com.A video of the fight shows the Muay Thai fighter giving Yi Long a heavy kick in the head, causing him to fall down and unable to get up again.Sports fans are apparently so disappointed by Yi Long's performance they called him a 'fake' and 'liar' on the Chinese social media platforms.        In an interview with Henan Satellite TV before the fight, Yi Long said he had declined many games and film contracts in order to prepare for the duel because he wanted to show the public the best side of him in his best years.After the game, Yi Long said he had not been training properly because he had been distracted by other personal matters, according to Hxnews.com. He also thanked his fan for their support and apologised for letting them down.  Yi Long's game has been compared to another fight earlier this year in which a self-proclaimed Tai Chi master was defeated by an MMA fighter.Xu Xiaodong, an MMA coach from Beijing, took down Tai Chi-practising Wei Lei in less than 10 seconds in front of shocked spectators on April 27 in Sichuan Province, south-east China.
