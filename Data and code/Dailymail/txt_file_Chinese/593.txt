 According to CRI, the tax applies to sedans and limos sold at above 1.3 million yuan (£151,000). Almost all luxury cars sold above 1.3 million yuan and above are imported. This includes brands such as Ferrari, Aston Martin and Rolls-Royce. Those buying luxury cars have many taxes to pay when purchasing a vehicle including a tax on engine size which according to CNBC can add up to 40 per cent to the purchase price.  Buyers of luxury cars also pay taxes including one based on engine size that can add up to 40 per cent to the purchase price. China is a big market for luxury cars.  Authorities are increasingly imposing taxes on luxury articles and products.          LaFerrari Aperta is on display during Paris Motor Show (File photo)The Ministry of Finance released a statement with the news saying: 'In order to guide rational consumption and promote energy-saving emission reduction, the State Council has approved additional consumption tax on ultra-luxury cars.' Sales of imported vehicles in China have been declining this year. There have also been fewer cars imported from January to October seeing figures down some 6.5 per cent year on year. China has been adjusting its consumption taxes over the past two years. The government is aiming to impose taxes on luxury articles and products that are considered energy-intensive and highly polluting.
