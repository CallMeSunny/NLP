 'In places without sanitation you have got way more than that,' Gates said, pointing to the feces inside the clear canister resting on a table.'And that's what kids when they are out playing, they are being exposed to all the time, and that's why we connect this not just with quality of life, but with disease and death and with malnutrition,' he told attendees.The billionaire said more than half of the world's population suffers without clean, comfortable sanitation facilities.

Visitors have long complained about poorly maintained or primitive open-pit in the countryMost importantly, the poor sanitary conditions contributed to the spread of diseases such as dysentery, cholera, hepatitis and infectious diarrhoea, according to state broadcaster CCTV.  The overhaul was backed by more than 1 billion yuan (£110 million) in central government funding and over 20 billion yuan (£2 billion) from local authorities. By Octover 2017, more than 68,000 public bathrooms were reconstructed and upgraded across various tourist destinations in the country - 19 per cent more than the target number, according to Xinhua News.In several bigger cities, such as Beijing, Haikou and Taiyuan, plusher public toilets have been built, offering bank ATMs, snack machines, Wi-fi and recharging stations for mobile phones and electric cars, according to South China Morning Post. Some toilets have also been expanded to include bigger unisex cubicles for the disabled, elderly and adults with young children.
