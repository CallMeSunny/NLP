The man then carries the boy in his arms before calmly leaving the scene last Thursday         The man looks around him before vanishing from sight with the boy soon afterwardsThe desperate father said he had been waiting outside the supermarket every day since, hoping to find some clues to Chuan Chuan's disappearance.The police found Chuan Chuan at around 11pm on Saturday in another city called Baoshan, which is 400 kilometres (250 miles) from Kunming, it is reported.    Chuan Chuan told the police that he had spent two days with a 'strange uncle' who had bought him a toy car and played with him next to a river. The boy was returned to his mother on the same night.His mother, Ms Li, told Kunming TV emotionally: 'I thought I had lost him forever. I cried every day.'Now he has been found. What a relief.'  The suspect has been detained by the police.The case is being investigated further.Why is child abduction a serious problem in China?          Around 200,000 boys and girls are reported to be missing every year in ChinaChild abduction is a serious problem in China, especially in rural areas. One major cause is that the Chinese families prefer sons to daughters, resulting in them buying baby boys. In addition, a severe gender gap - a result of four decades of one-child policy - has made it hard for Chinese men to find wives. Therefore, teenager girls are sometimes kidnapped and sold as child brides.Child abduction remains a sensitive topic to the Chinese authorities. No official figures have been released on how many children are kidnapped in China every year.However according to a 2016 report on Chinese news site Caijing, around 200,000 boys and girls are estimated to be missing every year. Among them, only 200, or 0.1 per cent, would be able to find their parents at some point of their lives.         A survey shows that around 64 per cent of the kidnapped children in China are boysThe report also claims that there are more than one million child beggars in China and most of them are abducted or forced to beg by their families.Baobeihuijia, a website specialised in connecting families with their missing members, has conducted a survey on the kidnapped children in China based on 8,861 cases listed on their website. The survey shows that around 64 per cent of the kidnapped children are boys and more than 75 per cent of the kidnapped children are under the age of six.However, among those who are abducted over the age of 13, there are more girls than boys.The survey also claims that children under the age of four are most likely to be abducted in China.
