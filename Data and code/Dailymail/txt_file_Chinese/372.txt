A woman suffering from a rare form of tissue cancer has seen her neck and face swell to several times larger than that of the average person.The unnamed Chinese woman, who is thought to be suffering from neuroblastoma, has reportedly been living in near isolation for several decades together with her elderly mother.The cancer forms in certain nerve tissues and has caused her neck and face to bloat since an early age.       With no money to treat the condition, the lumps in her adrenal glands have been allowed to develop unchecked.Footage released online by volunteers of a non-governmental organisation show a recent visit to the woman’s home, where they tried to understand how she has been surviving with neuroblastoma.

 The disease could also have been inherited from one of her parents, studies show, but without a proper diagnosis the full scope of the woman’s condition remains unclear.In the clip, the woman and her mother explain that they have been living off their local village’s subsidies - and that she is still able to eat despite the serious swelling.              A tumour has caused the unnamed woman's face to swell severely. She contracted the illness as a child and has lived in near isolation with her mother for decades in ChinaThe money, however, is nowhere near enough to get her treatment, which - depending on the severity of the illness - could include surgery or radiation.Members of the NGO say she may need to receive treatment abroad if she is beyond the help of doctors in China.Even if she does receive the necessary funding for treatment, the woman has not said explicitly that she would take up the option. Neuroblastoma   Neuroblastoma is a rare type of cancer that mostly affects babies and young children.It develops from specialised nerve cells (neuroblasts) left behind from a baby's development in the womb.Neuroblastoma most commonly occurs in one of the adrenal glands situated above the kidneys, or in the nerve tissue that runs alongside the spinal cord in the neck, chest, tummy or pelvis.It can spread to other organs such as the bone marrow, bone, lymph nodes, liver and skin.It affects around 100 children each year in the UK and is most common in children under the age of five.The cause is unknown. There are very rare cases where children in the same family are affected, but generally neuroblastoma doesn't run in families.Source: NHS
