China has completed the construction of three military bases on artificial islands in the China Sea, according to a US think tank which monitors activity in the strategically vital region.The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative said the work on Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs in the Spratly Islands included naval, air, radar and defensive facilities.AMTI's director, Greg Poling said satellite images taken this month showed new radar antennas on Fiery Cross and Subi and he added: 'So look for deployments in the near future.'          A satellite image of one of the artificial islands in the South China Sea, which has an airstripThe islands are hundreds of miles from the Chinese mainland and are also claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia, but China sees them as vital to protecting the strategically important sea routes to and from its ports. China has denied US claims it is militarising the South China Sea but last week Premier Li Keqiang said defence equipment had been placed on islands in the disputed waterway to maintain 'freedom of navigation.'AMTI said China's three air bases in the Spratlys and another on Woody Island in the Paracel chain further north would allow its military aircraft to operate over nearly the entire South China Sea.Several neighboring states have competing claims in the sea, which is widely seen as a potential regional flashpoint.

 In his Senate confirmation hearing in January, new US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson angered China by saying it should be denied access to islands it had built up in the South China Sea.He subsequently softened his language, saying the US and its allies 'must be capable of limiting China's access to and use of' the islands in the event of an unspecified 'contingency'.In recent years, the US has conducted a series of what it calls freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, raising tensions with Beijing.China sees the region as its 'backyard' and claims US meddling in it is the equivalent of Beijing trying to tell the Americans what to do in the Gulf of Mexico.
