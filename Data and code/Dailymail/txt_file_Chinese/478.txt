 'I can tell if someone is a good person or a bad person at a glance. When I saw Trump, I knew he would be a great leader,' Li Liangwei told MailOnline during a phone interview.'Roman wasn't built in one day. Trump has aspired to be a great person since he was young. He has extensive knowledge and always thinks for his country.'Mr Li, who is five years younger than Trump, added: 'It's an extraordinary thing to become the US president at the age of 70.'When Mr Li performs, his agent, Zou Dangrong, would arrange his hair to be dyed and whitening foundation to be applied before he takes the stage.However, the impersonator stressed that 'appearance isn't everything'.'I specialise in imitating Trump's gestures and facial expressions,' Mr Li said.          While promoting a tea brand, Mr Li holds a small barrel of tea in his left hand and does a thumbs-up with his right hand to imitate Trump         US President Donald Trump gives a thumbs-up as he speaks during his swearing-in ceremony on January 20, 2017 at the US Capitol in Washington, DCApparently, the man is best known for his Trump hand gestures. In one promotional photo, Mr Li stretched out both arms and gave a double thumbs-up - a posture which he thinks best captures the billionaire leader.In another commercial clip provided by Zou Dangrong, Mr Li was promoting a tea brand, called 'Above the Moon'. The man held a small barrel of tea in his left hand and did yet again another thumbs-up with his right hand.'His thumbs-up gesture is spot on,' Zou Dangrong told MailOnline, referring to Mr Li's imitation effort. 'When he uses his thumb to say something is okay, he looks a lot like Trump, his posture, his hairstyle, the look in his eyes, etc.'It is Mr Zou who discovered what he calls the 'uncanny resemblances' between Li Liangwei and Donald Trump.          China's Trump impersonator Li Liangwei (middle) stands with a team of actors pretending to be his bodyguards. The man was discovered by agent Zou Dangrong who also manages the Chinese impersonator of Barack Obama         The retired magazine publisher said he doesn't care much about politics, but as soon as he saw Trump on TV, he thought the US President is a 'clever person' and an 'inspirational figure'              Li Liangwei (right, without makeup) has jet-black hair and speaks no English, however the man said that 'appearance isn't everything' while impersonating Trump (left, pictured on April 11 in Washington, DC)Mr Zou owns a TV production company in Hunan Province. He also manages Xiao Jiguo, the Chinese impersonator of Barack Obama.'As Trump won the election and Obama's second term drew to a close late last year, I wondered if I could find a Trump impersonator - because it would be harder and harder for Obama's look-a-like to find business,' said Mr Zou.He tried to research on the internet and through his connections, but failed to find suitable candidates. Mr Zou discovered Mr Li by chance.The two had known each other for decades. When Mr Li worked at a magazine in Hunan Province in the 1990s, Mr Zou was his staff. Mr Zou later left to start his own business.One day last November, the two had dinner together. While debating over a topic, Mr Li put down his glass, rose a hand and did a thumbs-up.Mr Li immediately asked him to do that gesture again. He told Mr Li: 'You look like someone. You look like US President Trump.'Mr Zou said he took pictures of Mr Li and shared them on WeChat, a Chinese social media app. The picture received great feedback, with many people commenting on the 'striking similarities'.         Mr Li's agent would makeup artists to give the man a make-over before he performs. Hair dye would be used and whitening powder would be applied         'I specialise in imitating Trump's gestures and facial expressions,' Mr Li stressed, adding that his looks wouldn't hinder his effort of copying TrumpThe agent then hired makeup artists to give Mr Li a 'westernised' make-over, aided by hair dye, whitening foundation and blue contact lenses. Thus, a new star was born.Mr Zou said: 'There are many similarities between Trump and Mr Li. 'First of all, Trump has written books since 1980s; Mr Li was a writer and a magazine publisher. Secondly, they were both born to established families and are keen on social activities. In addition, one of Trump's daughters sings while Mr Li's daughter is a doctor of international music.'According to Mr Zou, most of Mr Li's clients have been medical firms which wish to promote their plastic surgery procedures, such as eye bag removal.Speaking of Trump's controversial comments, especially those on China, Mr Zou explained: 'Trump is debatable in China. He's not like Obama, whom everybody likes.'       Mr Zou believed Trump is still at the stage of teething in his presidential role and that he is getting to know about China. 'In conclusion, he is very smart and capable,' added Mr Zou.Li Liangwei seemed to agree. He said: 'The relationship between countries are like the relationship between family members. There will always be disagreements, but they usually pass the day after.'He added: 'Trump's sayings and doings reflect the process of his strategy planning, and it's a great process. I like the fact that he doesn't change his decisions easily based on other people's comments.'Funnily, the impersonator, who speaks in thickly accented Mandarin, concluded our interview with an impression he thought he did even better: of Chairman Mao.'I came from the same place as Chairman Mao. Do you know my accent is just like his?'The man then had a little cough and gave the famous announcement the Great Helmsman delivered on the Tian'anmen Square in 1949: 'I declare the People's Republic of China is founded.' THIS CHINESE PHEASANT ALSO LOOKS LIKE TRUMP, APPARENTLY           It's the pheasant: The five-year-old pheasant (pictured) is said to have Trump's hairstyleA golden pheasant became a star in China last November because people thought he had the same hairstyle as Donald Trump.Pictures of the animal became widely shared on Chinese media after a journalist from Hangzhou had taken a photo of the male bird and pointed out the 'striking similarities' between him and the then US President-elect.Mr Gao, the keeper of the bird, told MailOnline that he was surprised to hear the news, however he had begun to notice the resemblance between the two.The bird is five years old and lives in Hangzou Safari Park.Read more about the pheasant here.
