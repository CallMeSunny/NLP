Beijing and Shanghai, China's two largest cities, have banned residents from using electric scooters and Segways on roads amid safety concerns.Traffic authorities in Beijing said violators will be fined 10 Yuan (£1) starting on August 29; while the Shanghai police launched a crackdown last week on the popular modes of transport, reported the People's Daily Online.Electric scooters and Segways are getting increasingly popular among residents in large Chinese cities as a way to cope with traffic congestion.

Share this article Share   Scooters and Segways do not have rights to use public roads in China, according to the Law of the People's Republic of China on Road Traffic Safety. The ban applies to two-wheeled scooters as well as one-wheeled self-balancing scooters.Anyone who disobeys the law can be fined up to 50 Yuan (£5.7).One of the main concerns is safety.The country's traffic authorities said electric scooters are fast and accident-prone while Segways are difficult to maneuver as they have no accelerators or brakes.According to Beijing Daily, the city's consumers association had tested more than 20 brands of electric scooters and found most of their brakes did not meet the national standard of safety.The test discovered that the braking distance of the electric scooters could be as far as 9.9 metres (32 feet).Only one brand could come to a full stop in less than four metres (13 feet), which is the Chinese national standard. In terms of Segways, they could take as long as nine seconds to stop after the riders lean backwards to slow down.         Dangerous: Traffic authorities said Segways are difficult to maneuver as they have no accelerators or brakesThe Beijing traffic authority launched a campaign at the beginning of August to prohibit residents from using the two transportation methods on roads.A traffic policeman told Beijing Youth Daily: 'The one-wheel scooters can go as fast as 30kmh (18.6mph) and they don't have brakes. If they're used on motor vehicle lanes, it's very easy for them to crash into other vehicles and cause harm.'Two-wheeled scooters can even go as fast as 60kmh (37mph). They're almost as fast as motorised vehicles but the design of their brakes can not compete with that of a motorised vehicle.'Last week, the traffic authority in Shanghai launched a campaign on the city's busiest roads to catch electric scooter riders.Other major Chinese cities, including Wuhan and Guangdong, have also released new traffic rules to ban Scooters and Segways from the roads.
