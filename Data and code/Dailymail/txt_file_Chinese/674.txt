Student activists have been the big winners in Hong Kong elections, just two years after they led pro-democracy protests against Chinese rule that stunned Beijing.A record turnout in Sunday's vote helped sweep the newcomers into office, most notably Nathan Law, a 23-year-old who was said to have been behind the protests in 2014.He garnered the second-highest number of votes in his six-seat Hong Kong Island constituency.        Nathan Law, a 23-year-old who was behind the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong two years ago, celebrates after winning a seat on Hong Kong's legislative council during elections         Law, a former student, garnered the second-highest number of votes in his six-seat Hong Kong Island constituencyMr Law's party, Demosisto, founded earlier this year with fellow teen protest leader Joshua Wong, advocates a referendum on 'self-determination' on the future status of Hong Kong, which is in the middle of a 50-year transition period to Chinese rule.When asked about his victory, Mr Law said: 'It shows how Hong Kong people want change.

 'People are voting for a new way and new future of our democractic movement.'In another surprising result, Yau Wai-Ching, 25, of Youngspiration, which was formed during the 2014 protests and proposes a similar plan as Demosisto, secured a seat in the Legislative Council.The group's other candidate, 30-year-old Sixtus Leung, also appeared to be headed for a win, according to incomplete results for his constituency.

Electoral officers count ballots at the central ballot counting station. The election came as the newcomers pulled off their startling victories by riding a rising tide of anti-China sentiment as they challenged formidably resourced pro-Beijing rivalsAnother rookie, 38-year-old land reform campaigner Eddie Chu, won 84,121 votes, the highest number of votes garnered by any of the more than 200 candidates competing for 35 seats in geographic constituencies.Another 30 seats are taken by members representing business and trade groups such as accounting, finance, medicine and fisheries, most of which support Beijing because their members have close ties to China's communist elite on the mainland.At stake is the power to keep Hong Kong's widely unpopular Beijing-backed chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, and his government in check.Pro-democracy lawmakers need to win at least 24 of 70 seats to retain the power to veto unpopular proposed government legislation, including Beijing's controversial election revamp that triggered the 2014 street protests.
