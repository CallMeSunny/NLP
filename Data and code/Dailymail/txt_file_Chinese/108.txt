Lasers have been used to target US military pilots flying over the Pacific 20 times since September, according to officials, who pointed the finger of blame at China.The incidents, the latest of which occurred within the last two weeks, have all taken place over the highly militarized East China Sea, which is home to islands claimed by both China and Japan.Although none of the attacks have caused injuries, they appear similar to an incident in the East African country of Djibouti earlier this year, when two US pilots suffered minor eye problems which the military said originated from a Chinese base.         US officials accuse Chinese of orchestrating 20 laser attacks on its planes flying over the East China Sea, part of the Pacific, since September.

The US has repeatedly reaffirmed its support for Japan’s ownership of the islands, much to the anger of the Chinese.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 2 Next       Payback!

 American officials do not necessarily believe the laser strikes were carried out by the Chinese military, but maintain there is a likelihood they were done by people acting for the Chinese government.A Marines spokesman told Aviation Week & Space Technology they originated 'from a range of different sources, both ashore and from fishing vessels'. US officials refused to say whether the lasers were military-grade, but even regular store-bought lasers can threaten the safety of pilots.         The East China Sea is home to the disputed Senkaku Islands, which are controlled by Japan but also claimed by China, which calls them the Diaoyu. The US has repeatedly reaffirmed its support for Japan’s ownership of the territory, much to the anger of the Chinese       China has already developed at least four different types of portable laser weapons that are capable of blinding people, according to a 2015 report in the People's Liberation Army Daily.However, these weapons are prohibited from use on the battlefield by the Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons, which both China and the US are signatories to.Last September's incident at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti resulted in the US making an official complaint to the Chinese government.The Pentagon said aircraft had been hit with lasers nearly 10 times in the previous three weeks, including with military-grade beams which officials said they were confident came from a Chinese base nearby.
