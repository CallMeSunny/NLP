His wife was so angry at his decision that she decided to leave him.         Uh oh!

I did not expect it to be a reality. Brother I feel your pain.' While another commented: 'To save the mother is right, but I can understand the reaction from his wife. Life is not easy.' And one user said: 'As a wife and mother, I can understand this man's choice, but I'm sorry I will not forgive. This is my attitude.' Hebei province is one of the worst affected areas by the flooding and heavy rain.164 people have been killed and 125 remain missing in the latest flooding which has hit northern China over the past week.          A car stands upside down after floodwaters caused chaos in China's Hebei province
