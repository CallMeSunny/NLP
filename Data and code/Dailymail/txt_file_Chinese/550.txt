The black market has been providing counterfeit goods to label-hungry shoppers for almost as long as the credible designers. But while some of the fakes are so good that even a pro would struggle to notice the difference, others can be laughably bad. Travellers heading to China need to be very careful about what they purchase as it's a country that specialises in producing brazenly fake goods with names clumsily altered from the original.For instance, it is possible to pick up a caramel frappuccino at a 'Starbncks' coffee house or some groceries from an '8-12' convenience store.Elsewhere, image-conscious shoppers can buy a 'Rolexe' watch and a pair of 'New Barlun' trainers. Read on to see some of the funniest counterfeit products currently doing the rounds in China...           Can you spot the odd one out? 'Magic Ice' vodka looks suspiciously like a hybrid between Belvedere and Grey Goose vodka          The only thing funny about this Season Five DVD of Breaking Bad is the title translation          No gold star for the owner of this coffee shop, who has borrowed heavily from US cafe chain Starbucks         Why buy a Sharpie when you could also own a 'Skerple'? Because the latter can't even promise to write permanently on all surfaces         We've all heard of the 7-11 but apparently there is also a lesser-known convenience store called the 8-12. Maybe the owner just really enjoys a lie-in         Those pesky Storm Troopers get everywhere, even into a franchise called 'Space Wars' apparently          Ever fancied a pair of New Balance trainers? For the equivalent of £20 you could get a pair of New Barlun instead          Rolexe watches are a luxury item that many men and women aspire to own during a lifetime, but you could probably acquire a Rolexe a lot sooner          It's highly unlikely that Levi's approved the quality control message that came with this wallet          Why bother inventing a new name for a soft drink when you can alter one letter of an established brand and make a tidy profit?          A fake that's just pants: It's a sure bet that this piece of underwear isn't officially approved          The name of the 'Where's Wally' costume on the left might put a few shoppers off          This Harry Potter tale never made it to cinema screens, or even bookstores in the West, unsurprisingly         This box is just a web of lies, with Spider-Man toys labelled as Super-Man         It's game on for the counterfeiters with a games console posing as a fake Wii          Spider-Man appears to have had a name change in this Chinese toy store         This backpack really is covering all marketing angles with a nod to Sonic the Hedgehog, Harry Potter and Barrack Obama         We can't actually print what this coffee shop is called but here's a hint... it rhymes with the original cafe's name  CHINA'S FAKE ENGLISH TOWN    By Ted Thornhill  When it comes to faking it, the Chinese are in a league of their own.They’ve invented pirate brands such as King Burger and Anmani, built entirely convincing Apple stores, shopping streets boasting Starbocks Coffee – and even entire fake towns.One such copycat creation comes complete with red telephone boxes and a Gothic church. The town in China, which reportedly cost £500million to build, is officially called Thames Town and sits 19 miles outside of Shanghai.         When it comes to faking it, the Chinese are in a league of their own. They’ve invented pirate brands such as King Burger and Anmani, built entirely convincing Apple stores, shopping streets boasting Starbocks Coffee – and even entire fake towns (pictured)But despite being completed in 2006, its mock-Tudor buildings, cobbled streets and English pub remain desolate and many tourists liken it to The Truman Show. Thames Town is now used primarily by middle-class newlyweds, who choose it as the backdrop for their English-themed wedding snaps. Thames Town was built as part of Shanghai's ‘One City, Nine Towns’ scheme, which saw a cluster of satellite towns built around the city. Shops on the high street have names like 'Mike's Records' and 'the Fish Bar' - are empty and hundreds of homes are designed to imitate Victorian, Georgian and Tudor architecture sit idle with no sign of incoming tenants.
