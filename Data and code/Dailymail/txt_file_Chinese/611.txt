Share this article Share   The pictures were taken on November 12 on different motorways in Xiaogan. According to the pictures, the spinning disk was installed on a trailer pulled by a tractor.As the tractor moved, the brooms were rotating at high speeds sweeping the litter off the road.The machines were thought to be revamped by the workers themselves and were extremely efficient.According to the report, each of these 'incredible road sweeper' - as the Chinese media call them - can sweep 20 kilometres (12.4 miles) of roads every day. This is about 20 times the efficiency of a sanitation worker.          Clever idea: Workers in Xiaogan, China, put the brooms on a spinning disk and mount the disk at the back of a tractor          Highly efficient: According to the report, each of these road sweeper can sweep 20 kilometres (12.4 miles) of roads every dayAn earlier report by Xinhua said similar road sweepers had been seen in Dangyang, another city in Hubei province, used by the road maintenance workers on the local highways.On June 14, a similar road sweeper was seen travelling on the street on Gansu province, reported state media Xinhua, which had nine brooms attached to it.A YouTube video posted by user alsem001 last June also features a similar sweeping vehicle in China.         Brilliant idea:  The home-made device is 20 times more efficient than a normal road cleaner, according to local reportsThe creative road sweeper has gathered thousands of comments on Weibo, China's microblogging site. One user noted: 'It is funny but practical.'An one wondered if the sweeper really worked: 'Why didn't they simply connect a hoover to the truck?'A third one asked: 'Will it disperse the dust to the air? I feel bad for pedestrians eating on the roadside.'          Similar road sweepers have been spotted in Hubei Province and Gansu Province in the past
