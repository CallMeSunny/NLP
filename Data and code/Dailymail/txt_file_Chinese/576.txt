A school in east China has been criticised online after it introduced a course to stop young boys from acting 'delicate' and 'emotional'. However, the course at Xincheng Middle School in east China's Jiansgu province has been defended by students' parents who think their children need the course. This comes just months after a textbook was released in Shanghai with the aim of increasing masculinity among boys.          A school in Zhengzhou teaches boys to be more masculine in 2010 (File photo)          A boy sits in a class in a Beijing primary school (File photo)   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Horror as Russian ambassador to Turkey is shot dead in art...

 According to CCTV News, teachers at Xincheng Middle School in east China's Jiangsu province expressed concern that boys were unable to cope with mandatory military training in August this year.The teachers claimed that their male students were becoming more 'effeminate'. Tang Chao, deputy principal of the school told CCTV News: 'I remember a boy who was actually in a good physical condition. But he tried to find every excuse to escape the military training.' The new course labelled 'boy class' aims to teach male students how to 'live up' to their assigned gender. They will undergo a range of activities from physical training to gentlemen's etiquette.          Pupils attend a flag raising ceremony at their school in China (File photo)In October, a textbook was published in Shanghai titled 'Xiaoxiao Nanzihan' or Little Men in English which aimed to teach fourth and fifth graders on 'embracing masculinity'. Despite parents of the students backing the school, many people online have criticised the school. One user commented: 'How about the boys that didn't attend the class? They are still boys.' While another asked: 'What's being masculine? How can we define it?' And one user wrote: 'A healthy family is more important.' While CCTV News reported that parents defended the class. One parent of a student that signed up for the class said: 'This is such a serious issue. Gender education should be part of school education a long time ago. This is a life-changing course.'  While another parent told the People's Daily: 'Currently the problem of boys acting delicate is very prominent in society. The schools should adjust their policy to emphasize more on gender education. It's a big issue for the children.' According to CCTV, a similar class was held in Suzhou Foreign Language School for girls in 2007. The female students were taught mannerism, elegance and how to play instruments.
