 One users said: 'How could this kind of thing be fashionable?' and another said: 'Is playing with your phone not enough entertainment?'.The sewing of lips has been used in the past as a form of activism to protest against suppression, but there is no suggestion this is the case. It appears to be a game or a challenge related to self-harm, which is how Blue Whale started. Blue Whale is a game played via many social media platforms.Players are given a master who controls them for 50 days and each day they are given a task to complete.On the 50th day the masters behind the game instruct the young people to commit suicide and sadly across the world some have killed themselves. Earlier this year parents in the UK were warned about Blue Whale.  A school in Basildon was been told about the challenge following talks with Essex Police.               The deaths of Yulia Konstantinova, 15, pictured left, and Veronika Volkova, 16, right, were connected to the challenge in Russia         The game encourages youngsters to complete a series of challenges, including cutting themselves or carving symbols into their bodies         Yulia (pictured) and Veronika fell to their deaths from the roof of an apartment block in industrial Ust-Ilimsk         Yulia had earlier posted a picture with big blue whale, seen as a symbol of a social media movement encouraging children to take their own livesPanic over the online challenge was prompted by the death of two teenagers in Russia in February.Yulia Konstantinova, 15, and Veronika Volkova, 16, fell to their deaths from the roof of an apartment block in industrial Ust-Ilimsk.Meanwhile a girl named only as Ekaterina, 15, was critically injured after she fell onto snowy ground from a flat in the city of Krasnoyarsk.Just two days beforehand a 14-year-old girl from Chita was reported to have thrown herself under a commuter train.In all cases state investigators are probing whether a controversial web 'suicide game' has influenced the girls to seek to take their lives.Yulia left a note saying 'End' on her social page and earlier she had posted a picture with big blue whale. Her friend Veronika wrote: 'Sense is lost... End.' It was reported that two teenage boys were detained by police at the scene after allegedly filming the double suicide. In the Chita case, transport police confirmed that the so-called suicide game 'Blue Whale' is seen as a possible 'cause of death'.A second girl had made plans to kill herself with the dead teenager, but changed her mind at the last moment.Teenagers are urged to use a knife or razor to make the shape of a whale on their wrist or leg, say Russian reports.They are also urged to watch horror movies all day, and to wake themselves at 4.20am. Philipp Budeikin is being held on charges of inciting at least 16 schoolgirls to kill themselves by taking part in his social media craze called Blue Whale - which police fear is spreading to Britain.The Russian 21-year-old - who has now confessed to the crimes - says he thinks of his victims as 'biological waste' and told police that they were 'happy to die' and he was 'cleansing society'. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 116123 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details.
