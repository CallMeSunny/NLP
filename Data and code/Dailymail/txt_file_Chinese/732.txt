Last year, Chinese tech firm Alibaba paired with the country's largest automaker to connect their cars to the internet. Now, in an attempt to keep up with emerging technology, the companies will soon be implementing self-driving features into their vehicles.The car company's CEO Wang Jian told Reuters on Wednesday the new internet technology will allow the joint venture to quickly adapt its cars to become self-driving.         Chinese auto maker SAIC Motor Corp Ltd joined forces with e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd to invest 1 billion yuan ($160 million/£123 million) in a fund to develop internet-connected cars. The companies demonstrated their jointly-developed car equipped with the YunOS operating system (pictured)  CHINA'S SAIC JOINS THE DRIVERLESS CRAZE Chinese auto maker SAIC Motor joined forces with e-commerce giant Alibaba last year.The companies demonstrated their jointly-developed car equipped with the YunOS operating system at an event in eastern China's Hangzhou on Wednesday.'You'll quickly see driverless car technology resulting from this platform,' Wang said on the sidelines of the event.  Chinese auto maker SAIC Motor joined forces with e-commerce giant Alibaba to invest 1 billion yuan ($160 million/£123 million) in a fund to develop internet-connected cars.The companies demonstrated their jointly-developed car equipped with the YunOS operating system, which can link up with smart phones, at a launch event in eastern China's Hangzhou on Wednesday.'You'll quickly see driverless car technology resulting from this platform,' Wang told Reuters on the sidelines of the event.   Alibaba is relatively late to offer a platform that can link a smart phone to a car, trailing platforms already launched by Alphabet's Google, Apple and Baidu.But the race to commercialise driverless cars is far from over.  There are five levels of automation and experts predict a fully autonomous car will not hit the market until 2020 or later.

          Last year, Chinese tech firm Alibaba (founder, Jack Ma pictured) paired with the country's largest automaker to connect their cars to the internet. Now, in an attempt to keep up with emerging technology, the companies will soon be implementing self-driving features into their vehicles         Jack Ma, Alibaba's founder and chairman, and other company leaders attend the launch event of a internet-connected car. The companies demonstrated their jointly-developed car equipped with the YunOS operating system, which can link up with smart phones, at a launch event in eastern China's Hangzhou on WednesdayDriverless cars are being taught to drive more like human motorists in an attempt to help them recognise and respond to risks on the road.The technology is being developed in the hope of overcoming some of the problems that are thought to have led to the fatal crash involving a Tesla electric car with its autopilot feature enabled.Scientists and road safety campaigners insist there is still significant development needed before motorists will be able to take their hands entirely off the steering wheel and let robots take over. FIVE LEVELS OF AUTOMATION    Level One – A small amount of control is accomplished by the system such as adaptive braking if a car gets too closeLevel Two – The system can control the speed and direction of the car allowing the driver to take their hands off temporarily, but they have to monitor the road at all times and be ready to take over.Level Three – The driver does not have to monitor the system at all times in some specific cases like on high ways but must be ready to resume control if the system requestsLevel Four – The system can cope will all situations automatically within defined use but it may not be able to cope will all weather or road conditions. System will rely on high definition mapping.Level Five – Full automation. System can cope with all weather, traffic and lighting conditions. It can go anywhere, at any time in any conditions.           A view of the launch event of Alibaba's internet-connected car in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province THE ETHICS OF DRIVERLESS CARS   Suppose a driverless car is headed towards five pedestrians - it can stay on course and kill them or swerve into a concrete wall, killing its passenger.This ethical dilemma is a difficult one - and it appears that people cannot decide which outcome is better.New research shows that people generally approve of cars programmed to sacrifice their passengers to save others, but these same people would not want to be in the car themselves. Autonomous vehicles (AVs), have the potential to benefit the world by eliminating up to 90 per cent of traffic accidents.However, not all crashes will be avoided, and some crash scenarios will require AVs to make difficult ethical decisions. Study author, Dr Iyad Rahwan, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab who led the research, said: 'Most people want to live in in a world where cars will minimise casualties, but everybody wants their own car to protect them at all costs.'   Joshua Brown, 40, a former Navy SEAL, died in May after his Tesla Model S collided with a truck on a freeway in Williston, Florida, after it failed to detect the white trailer against the sky.An investigation into the crash is still ongoing by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but there are reports that Mr Brown had been watching a movie at the time.Tesla insisted its Autopilot feature was not intended to take over total control of the vehicle and it made clear to motorists that they must stay alert and prepared to take over at any time.However, the accident has led many to question the safety of putting autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles on the roads with human drivers.Research by the Transport Research Laboratory in Wokingham, Berkshire, has shown that drivers can easily become distracted once they believe a vehicle is capable of doing the driving itself.But a new project known as Move-UK, conducted by car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, technology firm Bosch and the Transport Research Laboratory, is aimed at improving the way computers spot risks on the roads.They are installing sensors and self-driving systems of a series of cars that will be driven by humans through the city streets and on public roads.The autonomous system will operate in the background without controlling the vehicle and its decisions will be compared to the real life actions of the human driver.This, engineers behind the project say, will allow them to develop better ways of spotting risks and teach the computers in which situations it is best to react.
