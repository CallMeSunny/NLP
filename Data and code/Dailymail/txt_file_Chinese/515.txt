 Bao Weimin from China's Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation told reporters today that the first component has been completed and is currently going through a testing phase. It will be launched next year and will be followed by a series of launches of other components which will dock with the core module in space. The core module named Tianhe-1 weighs some 20 tonnes and is the first of three modules which will make up the space station. According to China's state-run Xinhua news agency, the new Chinese space station will be smaller than the International Space Station. However there is room for expansion.                 Woman walks with a child as they visit a park with replicas of foreign and domestic vehicles         The Shenzhou VI spacecraft lifts off at Jiuquan Satellite Launch in 2005 (File photo)         China's Chang'e probe taken by China's first lunar rover (File photo) China Manned space Agency and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs are said to be working together with plans to open up the space station for UN member states, reports GB Times. China has previously had a space station in low orbit before however it is now defunct and is expected to come crashing down to earth later this year. Currently China is banned from the ISS due to a law which was passed by congress which bans NASA contacting the Chinese space program amid fears of national security. China also has other plans for its space programme for the next couple of years. Earlier this year, the country's agency announced its deep space exploration plans which includes two missions to Mars and a probe to Jupiter. Vice Director of China's National Space Administration Wu Yanhua announced that the first probe to Mars would be launched by 2020. China hopes to be a space power within the next 13 years.
