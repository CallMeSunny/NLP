Workers in China have nearly finished building a bungee platform that is attached to a glass-bottomed bridge.The adrenaline-inducing feature, a part of a £48 million glass bridge attraction, is installed 260 metres (850 feet) above the ground in the Zhangjiajie Grand Canyon in southern China.Once complete, the platform will be 23 metres (75 feet) higher than that of the Macau Tower, the highest commercial jumping spot in the world.          more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  MP Charles Walker says 'ITV should stop making Jeremy Kyle Show'       Watch video  Nigel Farage defends where Brexit Party funding is coming from       Watch video  Student snatches the weave off his substitute teacher in AL       Watch video  Lorry swerves into car in the left-hand lane on the M1           Watch video  Felicity Huffman arrives to court and is expected to plead guilty       Watch video  Shaman Durek explains his teachings and philosophy       Watch video  'We have to deliver Brexit urgently': Andrea Leadsom       Watch video  IKEA advertise a kitchen area by putting it at monkeys disposal           Watch video  Kerri-Anne Kennerley unleashes on Bill Shorten       Watch video  Nigel Farage and New European editor Matt Kelly clash over Brexit       Watch video  Fergus Kenny blasted by Jeremy Kyle during show broadcast in 2016       Watch video  Trump says it would be mistake if Iran do anything against U.S.

 According to a spokesperson from the Zhangjiajie Grand Canyon, two bungee platforms have been designed for the glass-bottomed bridge and both will be attached to the bridge deck near the middle of the walkway. A team of around 10 workers are in the final stage of building one of the platforms. The spokesperson said tourists would be able to jump from the platforms attached to a bungee cord which would measure at least 50 metres (164 feet) long. The spokesperson stressed the safety of the bungee platforms. He said the jumps to be made by tourists 'would cause no impact' to the bridge's glass deck because each of the bridge's 97 glass panels could bear an impact of up to 40 tonnes.In addition, when the bridge was inspected by the Chinese authority, experts had already assessed the feasibility of the bungee platforms, he added.The spokesperson also said the bungee platforms would undergo another safety check from the Chinese authority before being open to the public. Its opening date has not been announced yet.          more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  MP Charles Walker says 'ITV should stop making Jeremy Kyle Show'       Watch video  Nigel Farage defends where Brexit Party funding is coming from       Watch video  Student snatches the weave off his substitute teacher in AL       Watch video  Lorry swerves into car in the left-hand lane on the M1           Watch video  Felicity Huffman arrives to court and is expected to plead guilty       Watch video  Shaman Durek explains his teachings and philosophy       Watch video  'We have to deliver Brexit urgently': Andrea Leadsom       Watch video  IKEA advertise a kitchen area by putting it at monkeys disposal           Watch video  Kerri-Anne Kennerley unleashes on Bill Shorten       Watch video  Nigel Farage and New European editor Matt Kelly clash over Brexit       Watch video  Fergus Kenny blasted by Jeremy Kyle during show broadcast in 2016       Watch video  Trump says it would be mistake if Iran do anything against U.S.

              The 430-metre-long (1,410-foot-long), six-metre-wide (20-foot-wide) transparent walkway is built over a picturesque valleyThe bungee platforms are a part of the popular Zhangjiajie glass-bottomed bridge, which was the world's longest and highest glass-bottomed bridge when it opened in August, 2016.The 430-metre-long (1,410-foot-long), six-metre-wide (20-foot-wide) walkway is built over a picturesque valley. Its highest point is 300 metres (984 feet) above the ground while the bridge deck is 265 metres (869 feet) high.It beats the walkway above the Grand Canyon in Arizona, which sits at 720 feet high.However, it was recently overtaken by another glass-bottomed bridge - also in China - in length. It's 58 metres (191 feet) shorter than the Hongyagu Scenic Area glass-bottomed bridge which opened last Christmas in Hebei province.         Zhangjiajie glass-bottomed bridge was the world's longest and highest glass-bottomed bridge when it opened in 2016         According to its management, each of the bridge's 97 glass panels could bear an impact of up to 400 tonnesIn a previous interview, the same spokesman told MailOnline: 'The bridge is not only a bridge, it's a combination of nature, adventure and technology.'He said the bridge's surrounding area would be turned into the largest extreme sports base in China in the next few years.'It will offer a variety of activities, including rock climbing, scuba diving, rafting, cross-country motorcycling and wing-suit flying,' he addedApparently, the management is also planning to install a giant swing dangling from the bridge. According to the plan, the swing would be nearly 170 metres (558 feet) long.Designed by Israeli architect Haim Dotan, the dramatic bridge has cost approximately one and a half year to complete with the total cost of approximately 460 million Yuan (£48 million).Zhangjiajie Grand Canyon is a part of Zhangjiajie National Forest Park in Hunan Province, southern China.The area is renowned for its lush mountains and sandstone pillars. The latter is thought to be the inspiration of the 'floating peaks' in Avatar.           Zhangjiajie Grand Canyon is a part of Zhangjiajie National Forest Park in Hunan Province, southern China
