 According to People's Daily Online, the accident took place at around 9:45am on November 12 when two aircraft, including the one Ms Yu was piloting, were performing above the city of Tianjin.Debris of the crashed jet was found in the Dayangpu village near Tangshan city in Hebei Province.No explosions were heard before the crash, according to the report. 'As one of only four female pilots in the country capable of flying domestically made fighter jets, her death comes as a tremendous loss to the Chinese air force,' the Global Times newspaper said.Ms Yu, from Chongzhou in south-west China's Sichuan province, joined the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force in 2005, reports said.She graduated from training four years later, one of the first 16 Chinese women pilots qualified to fly fighter jets, the China Daily said, and in July 2012 was the first woman to fly the J-10. Fans dubbed her the 'golden peafowl', it added.

Social media has been flooded with tributes to Chinese fighter pilot Yu Xu (R) ©Johannes Eisele (AFP/File)Ms Yu appeared again at this year's show earlier this month, according to reports.The official news agency Xinhua quoted Air Force spokesman Shen Jinke saying all its personnel were 'deeply regretful and mournful' at her 'unfortunate death'.The J-10 is a workhorse of the Chinese air force. Two of the fighters conducted what the Pentagon called an 'unsafe' intercept of a US spy plane over the East China Sea in June.An estimated 400 of the jets have been built, most for Chinese use, according to defence analysts IHS Janes. It said in December reports had emerged of three crashes in the previous three months.
