 The Air China flight CA 103 took off at Tianjin Binhai International Airport at 10:21am and arrived at Hong Kong International Airport at 1:13pm.  Air China told MailOnline that all passengers were arranged to leave the aircraft safely once it landed.The airline company said it's investigating the incident. It did not reveal the number of passengers on board. But according to Oriental Daily, the aircraft is a Boeing 737-800, which usually carries 189 passengers. Hong Kong's Airport Authority told Oriental Daily the apparent bird strike hadn't occurred in Hong Kong's airspace, which is among the busiest in the world.The Hong Kong's Airport Authority also said they had not received any request of assistance from flight CA 103.The authority said staff at the Hong Kong airport work hard to keep birds away. To prevent potential wildlife hazard, they inspect the height of the grass along the tarmac as well as the apron regularly to ensure it's not tall enough for birds to stay.          Air China said the plane landed safely in Hong Kong and no passengers were injuredAn expert told local newspaper, Apple Daily, that a weather radar is installed inside the nose cone of a passenger plane. And the cone is often made with specific materials such as fibreglass, which could protect sensitive instruments of the plane while allowing electronic signals to pass through.MailOnline has contacted Hong Kong Aviation Authority for comments and is awaiting a reply. HOW DANGEROUS IS A BIRD STRIKE?   'Strikes are occasionally dangerous,' author and pilot Patrick Smith wrote in Cockpit Confidential.'This is especially true when engines are involved, as we saw in 2009 when US Airways flight 1549 glided into the Hudson River after colliding with a flock of Canada geese.'In this incident Captain Sullenberger courageously landed an A320 in the Hudson River after the plane lost thrust in both engines following the bird strike, which occurred moments after take-off.'Modern turbofans are resilient, but they don't take kindly to the ingestion of foreign objects, particularly those slamming into their rotating blades at high speeds,' said Smith.'Birds don't clog an engine but can bend or fracture the internal blades, causing power loss.'
