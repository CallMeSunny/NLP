 On his Facebook page he revealed how the race had been delayed due to adverse weather conditions. Mr Truglia, who served in the SAS and SBS for 20 years from 1980 to 2000, wrote: 'I'm out here [in China] doing a big aerial stunt, when the weather breaks.'         Mr Truglia had the world record for abseiling 100 metres - he died on Thursday after falling from a helicopter in China          The stuntman had appeared in James Bond movies and Hollywood classics and also held world records for the fastest abseil His former military colleague, Phil Tunnicliffe, said: 'We have not been able to find out much about what happened. He had meant to be attempting the stunt on Tuesday above the Wulong National Park but it had been put off until Thursday because of heavy mist and fog.'All we have been told is that there was a fall, but that does not make sense to us. Steve was a professional stunt man and had done these types of abseils many times.'He was meant to be racing from a Chinese stuntman dropping from the opposite side of the helicopter at the same time. He was worried it might not be big enough to take the weight of two people.'He added: 'It was 34 years ago we were at RAF Brize Norton doing our basic military parachute course.'When I heard the news I phoned him and left him a message, it was something I just felt to do, I also sent him a text.'In the message which he wrote on Facebook, he said: 'I can't believe you are gone mate, a part of me just died. You were my best friend and brother for 36 years. It hasn't sunk in that I'll never see you again.'One thing is certain I'll treasure the memories and never forget you.'           Mr Truglia, who died on Thursday, was a member of the Barking and Dagenham Canoe ClubMr Tunnicliffe said the organisers and authorities in China were providing help and assistance in repatriating Mr Truglia's body to the UK. Mr Truglia's girlfriend was informed of his death via a text message from a Chinese woman.A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'We have offered assistance to the family of a British national who has sadly died in Chongqing, China. Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.'
