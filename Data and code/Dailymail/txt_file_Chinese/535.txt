They are of crucial importance to our understanding of his attempts to control the world even in death.  Apparently, Emperor Qin's Terracotta Army is not the only famous Chinese relic that has been replicated by its own countrymen. Different versions of the Great Wall of China, an ancient fortification, have popped up across the country. Fake sections of the UNESCO-protected fortress have been spotted in the cities of Wuhan, Nanchang, Shenyang, and Jiangyin.People's Daily Online reported in 2015 that many tourists thought they were on the real Great Wall of China while in fact they were climbing a 2.5-mile-long replica version of the historic fortification. The real Great Wall of China  is estimated to be at least 13,170 miles long.Huaxi, which is billed as the richest village in China, also has its own version of the Great Wall for residents to enjoy.In addition, there are countless numbers of fake Pyramids, Taj Mahals and Tower Bridges in the country. Beijing even has a theme park devoted to fake landmarks. While Shenzhen in the south of the country also has something similar.          Tourists reportedly thought they were on the real Great Wall while they were climbing a replica in Nanchang (pictured)         Is it the real deal?
