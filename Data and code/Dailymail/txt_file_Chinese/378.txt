China is building a 'Mars village' in its desert where it will simulate the experience of being on the plant for researchers and tourists.The country is rushing ahead with its plans to send probes to Mars by 2020 with bigger plans to send humans to the red planet after that. The village will be based in Qinghai province of which 95,000 square kilometres is a desert with lack of vegetation.

In 2015, NASA sent six researchers to live on a mock Mars in Hawaii for a year.  In January this year, China announced its plans to send probes to Mars and Jupiter.                   The village will be based in China's Qinghai province where tourists will also be able to visit         Chinese astronauts wave before their mission to space in 2008 (File photo)          It's thought that Qinghai province was picked because of its close likeness to Mars (pictured)       Vice Director of China's National Space Administration Wu Yanhua announced that the first probe to Mars would be launched by 2020.The country hopes to be a space power within the next 13 years.China is also hoping to be the first country to soft land a probe on the far side of the moon next year.While Russia and the United States have more experience in manned space travel, China's military-backed programme has made steady progress in a comparatively short time.         Scientists say it will serve as an important base for astronauts and geologists to use              The country hopes to be a space super power in 13 years including trips to Mars (pictured)
