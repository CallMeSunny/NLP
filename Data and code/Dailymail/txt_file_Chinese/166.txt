 The USS Theodore Roosevelt flotilla arrived in Singapore on Monday for a regular port call after a deployment in the Middle East.It has been reported it will conduct drills with two US 7th Fleet carrier groups, centred on the USS Ronald Reagan and USS Carl Vinson, as they pass through the disputed waterways. The military manoeuvres are being held as an Asian economic forum gets underway on the Chinese island of Hainan, which borders the disputed South China Sea.Li Jie, an expert on the Chinese navy, said it was the first time the Liaoning had taken part in live-fire drills.'This will test the Liaoning's real combat strength as well as joint-operations skills between the aircraft carrier and warships from other fleets,' Beijing-based Li told the South China Morning Post.       Another Beijing-based military analyst Zhou Chenming told the paper: 'China wants to show the outside world its determination to defend the fruits of its economic reforms over the past 40 years.'The increasing military presence in the South China Sea indicates that Washington sees Beijing as a serious competitor, not only economically, but also militarily.'But China realises that the military gap with the US is still very big, and all its military deployments in the South China Sea are basically defensive, including its DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile.' The exercises come as China has vowed to fight the U.S. 'at any cost' after President Donald Trump proposed slapping an additional $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods - escalating an already bitter trade war.Trump's surprise move on Thursday came a day after Beijing announced plans to tax $50 billion in American products, including soybeans and small aircraft.
