China has banned parents and guardians in its heavily Muslim region of Xinjiang from encouraging their children into religious activities. The government unveiled new education rules on October 12 meaning that those who encourage or force their children into religious activities will be reported to the police. Previous rules have already banned beards for men and head coverings for women in a province that is home to over ten million Muslims.          Uygur men pray before eating a holiday meal in Turpan County, Xinjang (File photo)         Uighur people are seen outside the Id Kah Mosque in northwestern Xinjiang (File photo)         Uygur women wear their head scarves while shopping at a market (File photo)   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Was it a hate crime?
