 The propaganda film, shared by Chinese state media People's Daily on its social media account, was released ahead of China's largest airshow which will take place from November 6 to 11 in Zhuhai. CH-5 DRONE BOMBER: WHAT WE KNOW  Wingspan: 21 meters (69 feet)Maximum take-off load: 3,300 kilograms (7,275 pounds)Flight time: 60 hoursMaximum range: 10,000 kilometres (6,213 miles) Maximum flight altitude: 8,000 metres (26,246 feet)Maximum external load: 1,000 kilograms (2,204 pounds)  The clip includes a recent live-fire drill during which CH-5, billed as an 'air bomb truck', successfully blew up moving targets.It also shows the footage of the aircraft's flight test in May on the Tibetan Plateau. During the test, the warplane successfully took off and landed at an airport 3,500 metres (11,482 feet) above sea level.CH-5 is developed and manufactured by the China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics. It's the latest member of the country's Rainbow Drone Project. The drone bomber has reported entered a mass-producing stage.          The latest film shows the deadly military drone striking still and moving targets at live-fire drills         The aircraft can carry 16 missiles and strike targets while flying at an altitude of 19,685 feetThe mass-produced model has a wingspan of 21 meters (69 feet) and a maximum external load of 1,000 kilograms (2,204 pounds), said China Central Television Station.'Because of its external load, its reconnaissance and attacking capabilities has made a qualitative leap compared to the previous models,' Ou Zhongming, the General Director of the Rainbow Drone Project, told China Central Television Station.The plane's maximum take-off load is 3,300 kilograms (7,275 pounds).A redundancy system has been fitted into its flight control, which would enable the drone to carry on with its task even if one component breaks down, Mr Ou added.         CH-5 can fly up to 60 hours without refuelling with a maximum altitude of 26,246 feet          CH-5 is said to be China's equivalent to U.S. drone, General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper (pictured)The CH-5 is also capable of carrying high-definition radar systems which would allow the aircraft to conduct surveys at different altitudes. When the CH-5 debuted in 2016, Chinese media said it was the country's equivalent to the American military drone, General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper. CH-5 is said to be twice as big as China's other drone fighter jet CH-4 and can carry 2.5 times more external load than CH-4.The head engineer, Shi Wen, said in a previous interview with Global Times that CH-5 would be able to fly 120 hours without refuelling in the future.The original CH-5 made its maiden flight in August 2015 in China's Gansu Province.
