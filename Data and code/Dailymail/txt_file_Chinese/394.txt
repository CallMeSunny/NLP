China's only aircraft carrier has sailed into Taiwan's territory this morning, the fourth time it has happened in recent months. Beijing is determined to reassert its control over the island, which China  claims as a breakaway province awaiting reunification.The warship, The Liaoning, entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone early this morning, having departed Hong Kong yesterday. Scroll down for video          The Liaoning, China's first aircraft carrier, entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone earlier this morning. It is pictured leaving Hong Kong yesterday         The warship sailed in Taiwanese waters on its way back from Hong Kong, and is being monitored by defence officials in TaiwanIt had featured in events marking the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China, having been ruled by Britain for more than 150 years.Taiwan's defence ministry has claimed the breach was no cause for alarm, but said it was monitoring the situation. The Soviet-built Liaoning, China's first aircraft carrier, has sailed near the self-ruling Taiwan four times in recent months during what Beijing describes as routine drills.Chinese media report that it can carry 36 aircraft, including 24 Shenyang J-15 fighter jets and 12 helicopters.Earlier this month Taiwan scrambled jets to shadow the carrier as it made its way to Hong Kong.         Earlier this month Taiwan scrambled jets to shadow the carrier as it made its way to Hong Kong         Earlier this week the US was forced to apologise after President Donald Trump mistakenly referred to Chinese president Xi as leader of the 'Republic of China'China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan, which China considers a wayward province, under its control.The flashpoint comes after the US was forced to admit a gaffe in remarks made by President Donald Trump before a meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping.China said on Monday that the US had apologised after Beijing officially protested a White House statement that mistakenly described Xi as the president of the 'Republic of China'.Xi is president of the People's Republic of China, while the Republic of China is the official name for Taiwan.          Xi is president of the People's Republic of China, while the Republic of China is the official name for Taiwan         The US President was heavily criticised in China in the early days of his presidency for accepting a call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen (pictured)The error was made in an official readout of US President Trump's remarks before a bilateral meeting with Xi during last weekend's G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.The US President was heavily criticised in China in the early days of his presidency for accepting a call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.He later backed down on abandoning the 'One China' policy, which maintains there is only one China which Taiwan is part of.Last month, the US administration further provoked the ire of Beijing when it approved $1.3 billion worth of arms sales to the self-ruling island.America remains Taiwan's most powerful ally, despite having no official relations with capital Taipei for decades.         The warship, The Liaoning, entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone early this morning, having departed Hong Kong yesterday       'The US side has expressed that they are sorry for this technical error and they have made a correction,' Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said of the gaffe during a regular press briefing.Tensions over Taiwan mark yet another drawback for Sino-US relations, which have turned tense as Trump has stepped up pressure on the Asian powerhouse to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme.In the last month, Washington has angered Beijing by imposing sanctions on a Chinese bank accused of laundering North Korean cash, voicing concern about freedom in semi-autonomous Hong Kong and sailing close to a disputed island in the South China Sea.
