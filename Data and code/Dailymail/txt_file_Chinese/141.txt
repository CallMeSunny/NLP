China has hit back after the US called Beijing's demands to list Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau as Chinese territories 'Orwellian nonsense' in a recent rant.In a statement released on Monday, China called on the US and other countries to 'respect its sovereignty' and recognise the legitimacy of its control of the contested territories.  'Whatever the US says will never change the objective fact that there is only one China in the world and the Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan regions are an inalienable part of China's territory,' Geng Shuang, a ministry spokesman, said in a statement on the ministry's website. 'Foreign enterprises operating in China should respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, abide by China's law and respect the national sentiment of the Chinese people.' The move comes after the United States on Saturday scolded China for attempting to impose 'political correctness' on American airline carriers by asking them to classify Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as Chinese territories.          Ground crew members wave as United Airlines makes it maiden voyage from Washington Dulles to Beijing         Several airlines including Delta (pictured) were asked to recognise disputed territories as part of China       The Chinese Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC) issued a written warning to 36 foreign airlines, including a number of US carriers, demanding the companies change their references. A sternly worded White House statement excoriated Beijing for the demands, which it termed 'Orwellian nonsense.''President Donald J. Trump ran against political correctness in the United States,' it said. 'He will stand up for Americans resisting efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to impose Chinese political correctness on American companies and citizens.'The statement added that the Chinese Civil Aviation Administration sent a notice to 36 foreign air carriers, including a number of American carriers, on April 25, asking them to comply with Beijing's standards.

 As of Saturday, the website of American Airlines listed Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as entities separate from China. Rivals United Airlines and Delta listed Taiwan separately but not Hong Kong or Macau.Taiwan has been self-ruled since splitting from the mainland after a 1949 civil war, maintaining its own government, military and independent foreign policy.But Beijing has refused to recognize the island, viewing it as part of its territory awaiting reunification with the mainland - by force, if necessary.The US has maintained a delicate diplomatic balance since 1979, recognizing Beijing's sovereignty as part of its 'One China' policy, while remaining Taiwan's most powerful unofficial ally and main supplier of arms.Meanwhile, Hong Kong, a British colony until 1997, and Macau, a Portuguese colony until 1999, are now 'special administrative regions' of China.         The Chinese government led by Xi Jinping (pictured) called on other countries to 'respect their sovereignty'  FOREIGN AIRLINES IN CHINA    Airline  Lists 'Hong Kong, China'  Lists 'Taiwan, China'Lists 'Macau, China'    British Airways YESYES(No service)  Singapore AirlinesYESNO  YESVirgin Australia NO NO NO Etihad Airways  YES(No service)(No service) All Nippon NO NO NO Korean Air NO NO NO Air CanadaYESNO  YESJapan Airlines NO NO (No service) Qantas YES NO  YESDelta  YESNO  YESUnited YES NO  YES  The move came after the US and China held high-stakes trade talks in Beijing aimed at forestalling a looming conflict between the world's two largest economies.In January, Australia's Qantas Airways changed its website classification of Taiwan and Hong Kong from separate countries to Chinese territories, blaming its earlier approach on an 'oversight.'British Airways was also widely criticized on Chinese social media back in March for listing Taiwan and Hong Kong as separate entities.BA appears to have 'rectified' the situation on its website. Anyone ordering tickets to breakaway provinces and territories will see that they are listed as part of 'China.' Now anyone who orders tickets to these areas will see that they are marked as part of China.
