 Zhang Mengqiu lives in the village of Xiaozhuang in Wuqiang county, Heshui city, according to a report on QQ.com.His father, Zhang Yukun, was a renowned calligrapher in the region.The elderly man became paralysed in 2012. Yunkun had been devastated by his wife's death in the same year and suffered a stroke, which caused him to lose the ability to move his limbs.In order to look after his father, Mengqiu quit his job five years ago.He feeds his father and helps him practise walking every day. He also learned various Chinese traditional medicine therapies, such as cupping and acupuncture, and applies them on his father.              Zhang Yukun (pictured) enjoyed watching canines performing stunts on TV, so Mengqiu bought two dogs (one of them pictured) and trained them upYukun became depressed after the family's pet dog had gone missing. To cheer him up, Mengqiu bought two Belgian Malinois dogs in 2015 to accompany the elderly man and to cheer him up.Mengqiu told Hubei TV Station that his father liked watching dogs walking tightropes on TV. As a result, he trained the two dogs to perform the stunt so that his father could have the entertainment every afternoon in the courtyard.The man claimed to have taught his dogs other stunts, including sitting up straight, climbing stairs and jumping over walls.Apparently, Mengqiu has risen to fame in China for his devotion.Not only is he praised by his neighbours for the great lengths he had gone to in order to look after his father; the man is also billed as a 'filial son' by the local Hebei TV Station because he has brought 'enjoyment' to his father's life.One of his neighbour told Hubei TV Station: 'Nobody in the village says bad things about him. Everyone praises him to be such a good son.' Furthermore, China Central Television Station has made a documentary about Mengqiu and his rope-walking dogs to promote his dedication in carrying out his duty as a child.              Mengqiu has taken care of his father for five years. He feeds his father and helps him practise walking every dayDespite Mengqiu's national fame in China, animal lovers have voiced concerns over the well-being of his dogs.Wendy Higgins from Humane Society International appreciated Mengqiu's intention and called it 'honourable'.However, Ms Higgins said the fact Mengqiu wants to make his ill father laugh doesn't make the dogs suffer less due to the training and performing.She told MailOnline: 'No dog would walk a tightrope willingly, so punishment or fear-based training is likely to have been used.'[This] means that these dogs have probably suffered mental anguish and endured physical pain, such as sore or cut paws.'Ms Higgins also pointed out that subjecting animals to such an ordeal should 'make us cry, not laugh'.Animals Asia also recognised Mengqiu's dedication and called him a 'devoted son'. But the Hong Kong-based charity organisation also said Mengqiu's story is a good example of why education of animal welfare is 'so necessary' in China.Jill Robinson MBE, the Founder and CEO of Animals Asia, told MailOnline: 'Zhang Mengqiu is in no way a bad guy, but his actions could - unbeknown to him - be harming the welfare of these dogs. 'Ms Robinson added: 'There are many more suitable ways to bond, such as simply throwing a ball for them. 'They get the exercise and Zhang Mengqiu's father gets the positivity of seeing a happy beautiful animal behaving naturally.'
