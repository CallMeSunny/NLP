In addition, the woman became very heavy after her clothes were soaked with water.As a result, Mr Shi decided to smash the ice with his bare hands so he could drag the drowning pensioner to the edge of the river.               Quick-thinking: The 54-year-old carefully knelt on the river while trying to drag out the woman. But he failed to do so after a few attempts, so he decided to use his hands to smash the iceA video, released by China Global Television Network, shows Mr Shi was joined by another passerby, Ma Hongjie, when he was breaking the ice. At one point, a large area of ice cracked and the two rescuers both fell into the river, which is about one metre deep (three feet). But they quickly found their footing.Eventually, Mr Shi who stood in freezing water pushed Ms Zhai towards the surface while Mr Ma pulled her towards a safe area.              Team effort: Mr Shi was later joined by another passerby, Ma Hongjie. The two rescuers both fell into the water at one point, but managed to move the pensioner to safety after a whileMore good samaritans later joined Mr Zhai and Mr Ma. Together, they helped Ms Zhai to change into dry clothes. Ms Zhai's family were informed of the matter. Ms Zhai was taken back home by her family members and Mr Shi. After saving Ms Zhai, Mr Shi went back home to drink a bowl of ginger soup and take a hot shower. He then went to work as normal. Speaking to Xinhua News Agency, the modest man said: 'Every one at the scene was a hero. I'm proud to see so many good citizens living in Baoding.'
