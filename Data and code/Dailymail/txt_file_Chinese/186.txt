 Ms Yao explained to the doctors that she has been suffering rheumatism, a long-term condition that causes pain in body joints and connective tissues.Five years ago, she found a folk remedy to cure the pain, which was to eat three live frogs and not telling anyone about it.It's said that Ms Yao's relatives found out about the fact that Ms Yao had eaten live frogs when she was hospitalised with a parasitic infection in the past.
