Let the poor thing go! Animals should not be dressed in clothes! Put this animal in a protected environment to protect its species!'Heather Newsome wrote: 'At first this video was cute and then I started thinking about it and it made me sad, very sad and the comments just confirmed what I was thinking.'               Embarrassed: The tourist looked visibly embarrassed as the orangutan climbs on for a piggy pack and plants another kiss on her cheekElisa Allen, Director of PETA UK, told MailOnline: 'Orangutans are shy, sensitive, highly intelligent, and socially complex animals – not props or objects of ridicule. 'When they're seen posing or performing, it's because they're afraid of what might happen if they don't "behave". 'Commonly, their spirits have been broken and they've learned to obey through deprivation, fear, and physical punishment. 'Most of the animals abused at these tacky tourist traps were torn away from their mothers within days or weeks of birth – a separation that is traumatic for both mother and baby. 'In this day and age, with all that we know about animals, it's totally unacceptable for tourists to support such exploitation. 'People who pay for novelty photos such as these are complicit in perpetuating cruelty to animals, and PETA urges them to say "no".
