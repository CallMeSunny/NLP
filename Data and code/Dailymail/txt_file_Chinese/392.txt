 PETA Asia told MailOnline that the elderly man lost his two dogs on July 11. According to information provided by their volunteers, the elderly man is in his 70s. He works as a security guard in a garage and he lives in a room inside the garage.The two dogs were stray dogs, but the man adopted them. Because the man's home is small, he would sometimes chain the dogs to trees and posts on the side of the streets.An officer from PETA Asia said the two dogs had been kept inside the man's home on the day of the incident. The officials stormed the man's home, dragged both animals out and beat them with wooden sticks.The PETA officer also said that after the dogs were killed, the elderly man was told to pick up their bodies and put them next to a lamp post, which they were regularly chained to.The officials then took pictures of the dogs next to the post to prove they were stray dogs, said PETA Asia, which also supplied videos and a picture of the incident taken by onlookers.              The officials stormed the man's home, dragged both animals out and beat them with sticks'Dongtai city started culling stray dogs because they wanted to be named a "clean and civilised city",' explained PETA Asia.It's said that Dongtai had established a dedicated dog-catching team. The dog-catching team is not a part of the police. It is managed by the urban management team.According to PETA Asia, 'the team would receive 100 yuan (£11) for every dog they beat, and they have a target'.Posts about the incident quickly went viral on the Chinese social media, but they were immediately removed by the authority. Animals Asia Foundation condemned the incident in a social media post today. The organisation said the officials killed several dogs in Xinqiao New Estate in Dongtai on July 11 after receiving complaints from the public.  It also said the Dongtai Public Security Bureau admitted to them that they had been culling dogs.              The PETA officer also said that after the dogs were killed, the elderly man was told to pick up their bodies and put them next to a lamp post, which they were regularly chained toAnimals Asia Foundation said they hope relevant officials would use a humane - not a bloody - method to manage dogs.They also said they would send a petition to the authority to help improve policies on stray animals and pets. However, the Dongtai police told a different story. According to China News, Dongtai Public Security Bureau said the elderly man is surnamed Chen.       In a statement released last night, the police said officers had received repeated complaints from the public, who requested them to capture and kill Chen's dogs, which had been kept on the street.After the officers educated Chen, the man voluntarily asked them to have his dogs killed, according to the police.  Just a week ago, the officials of another Chinese city, Lanzhou, were forced to apologise after animal activists found dozens of homeless dogs beaten by officials and dumped in straw bags.Relevant authority admitted that the stray dogs had been beaten to death by their officers after videos and pictures of the incident became viral on Chinese social media.
