PREVIOUS RECORD HOLDER: THE 'CHICKEN CUP'          Breaking records:  'Chicken Cup' from Chinese Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)Today's price tag surpasses the former record made by a tiny white piece known as the 'Chicken Cup'. The rare Ming Dynasty wine cup was created during reign of the Chenghua Emperor between 1465 and 1487.Taxi-driver-turned-financier Liu Yiqian, one of China's wealthiest people bought the cupHe famously drank tea from the delicate vessel after his purchase, creating something of a social media meltdown in China at the time. There are thought to be just 87 pieces of Ru official ware in existence and only six have been sold publicly since 1940.Ru ware has an almost mythical status which is attributed to its short-lived production period, generally believed to not have exceeded 20 years.China's various dynasties were well-known for their fine ceramics with the Song period frequently considered as producing some of the region's most outstanding examples.
