A man in China has had his dead wife's body frozen in the hope that she might be able to live again when technology catches up.The body of Zhan Wenlian, who died of lung cancer aged 49, is stored in liquid nitrogen at minus 196 degrees Celsius in a cryogenic institute in Shandong Province.Gui Junmin, also 49, told Chinese reporters that he made the decision out of love and that he believed his wife was not dead, but sleeping.         Zhan Wenlian (pictured) died of lung cancer in Shandong, China, on May 8 at the age of 49         Ms Zhan's husband, Gui Junmin (pictured), decided to have her body cryopreserved. The man said he was reluctant to let his wife go and would not want to see her cremated   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Run pig run! Hundreds of piglets cause chaos in a Chinese...

 Mr Gui told Xinhua News Agency that he was reluctant to let his wife go and would not want to see her cremated. 'I don't want to see her disappear in the burning flames, with nothing left,' Mr Gui said to Xinhua. In a separate interview with China National Radio, Mr Gui said he didn't feel his wife had passed away. 'I think she has gone somewhere to rest for a while,' the husband told a reporter.  The widower said having his late wife's body frozen would not only benefit his family, but also contribute to the development of medical technology.The late Ms Zhan was cryogenically frozen in May, but the case has just been revealed to the public by Shangdong-based Yinfeng Biological Group, which carried out the preservation process.         Ms Zhan's body was stored in a 2,000-litre tank inside the lab of Yinfeng Biological Group. The tank (pictured) is filled with liquid nitrogen and is kept at minus 196 degrees CelsiusAccording to Mr Gui, his wife had agree to have her body frozen before she passed away. Experts from the biological group waited in Ms Zhan's ward when doctors from the Qilu Hospital of Shandong University pronounced she was dead at 4:01am on May 8. According to Yinfeng Biological Group, the experts injected chemicals, including blood thinner and antioxidants, into Ms Zhan's body within two minutes of her legal death to prevent her blood from clotting. Ice salt water was also pumped into her body to help cool it down. At the same time, a breathing machine and CPR were given to the body to keep the blood circulating and to supply the body with oxygen.Within 13 minutes, Ms Zhan's body was transported to Yinfeng Biological Group's laboratory where experts would cool down the body further and replace the blood with solution to preserve the organs - a critical step in the whole process.After around 10 hours, Ms Zhan's body temperature dropped to minus 190 degrees Celsius, and in the evening of May 10, her body was stored in a 2,000-litre tank which was filled with liquid nitrogen. Her body would be kept in the container at minus 196 degrees Celsius for the foreseeable future. The preservation is said to have cost more than one million yuan (£116,000), and because it was the first of its kind in China, the cost has been covered by Yinfeng Biological Group.            Experts from the Yinfeng Biological Group waited in Ms Zhan's ward when doctors from the Qilu Hospital of Shandong University pronounced the woman was dead on May 8         Experts injected chemicals into Ms Zhan's body right after her legal death to keep her blood flowing. Then they took the body into their lab to be cooled down and preservedThis is the first case of croyonic freezing in China which sees an entire human body being cryopreserved.Du Hong, a late science fiction editor, was the first Chinese person to have her body parts croyonically frozen. Ms Du, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2015 at the age of 60, had her brain frozen in the hope of living a second life.When Du Hong died, her daughter Zhang Siyao was reported to have shared a post with her friends on social media, which read: 'Mum, let's meet in the future.' Yinfeng Biological Group said in a press release that it was hard to say whether or not Ms Zhan's life could be revived at this point, but her preservation carried a high medical value and a social significance.A spokesperson from the group told MailOnline because the news had caught the attention of local hygiene and administration authority, the company could not reveal further details of the case.          Experts bowed to Ms Zhan's remains after they finished cryopreserving her bodyThere are around 350 cryogenically frozen individuals in the world, the majority of which are in the United States. No individual has so far been brought back to life.  The world's first cryopreserved human being was James Bedford, a psychology professor from the United States. Mr Bedford died in 1967 of kidney cancer at the age of 72, and his corpse was frozen by three experts, including Robert Nelson.In 2017, 50 years after Mr Nelson carried out the then cutting-edge process, the scientist, now 80, said that he was confident Mr Bedford would one day live again.   WHAT IS CRYOPRESERVATION, HOW MUCH DOES IT COST AND HOW DOES IT WORK?           Process: The girl will have been treated within minutes of death - flown to America and then slowly frozen to an ultra-low temperature in the hope, one day, she'll be woken up againWHAT IS CRYOPRESERVATION?The deep freezing of a body to - 196C (-321F). Anti-freeze compounds are injected into the corpse to stop cells being damaged. The hope is that medical science will advance enough to bring the patient back to life. Two main US organisations carry out 'cryonics' – Alcor, in Arizona, and Cryonics Institute, Michigan.HOW IS IT MEANT TO WORK?The process can only take place once the body is legally dead. Ideally, it begins within two minutes of the heart stopping – and no more than 15. The body must be packed in ice and injected with chemicals to reduce blood clotting. At the cryonics facility, it is cooled to just above OC and the blood is replaced with a solution to preserve organs. The body is injected with another solution to stop ice crystals forming in organs and tissues, then cooled to - 130C. The final step is to place the body into a container which is lowered into a tank of liquid nitrogen at - 196C.WHAT'S THE CHANCE OF SUCCESS?Many experts say there is none. Organs such as the heart and kidneys have never been successfully frozen and thawed, so it is even less likely a whole body – and the brain – could be without irreversible damage.HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?Charges at the Cryonics Institute, where the girl has been stored, start at around $35,000 (£28,000) to 'members' for whole-body cryopreservation. The girl was charged £37,000, which may include costs such as transportation. Rival group Alcor charges $200,000 (£161,000) for whole-body preservation.HOW LONG BEFORE PEOPLE CAN BE BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE?Cryonics organisations claim it could be decades or even centuries. However Medical experts say once cells are damaged during freezing and turned to 'mush' they cannot be converted back to living tissue, any more than you can turn a scrambled egg back into a raw egg.
