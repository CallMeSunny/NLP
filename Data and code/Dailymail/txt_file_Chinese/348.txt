Mud-slinging: Prime Minister Theresa May, pictured with Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe during a business forum in Tokyo today, was accused of being 'weak' by ChinaAn editorial in the state-run Chinese newspaper Global Times said: 'May's Conservative party lost many seats, turning her into a vulnerable prime minister.'Weak people often look for opportunities to show their strength.

 The editorial also accused Mrs May of 'rehashing' U.S. President Donald Trump's statements on North Korea. Earlier today, China's Defense Ministry spokesman Col. Ren Guoqiang said that all parties should exercise restraint and avoid words and actions that escalate tension.Ren said it's China's position that 'military means cannot be an option for resolving this issue.'         Statement: Mrs May reviews an honor guard, together with Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera, on board the Maritime Self-Defense Force's helicopter carrier Izumo at Yokosuka base, southwest of Tokyo         Mrs May has asked China to use it's leverage as North Korea's main ally to put pressure on Pyongyang, who celebrated Tuesday's missile launch with televised 'parade', pictured         No words: President Trump tweeted on Wednesday that 'talking is not the answer!'Beijing has also slammed a report that suggested the US, Japan and Britain were planning fresh punitive measures against the North, saying calls for sanctions were 'destructive' and that those measures alone 'cannot fundamentally resolve the issue'.The British Prime Minister's comments on China's role in de-escalating tensions between North Korea and the rest of the world came during her trip to Japan this week. Mrs May said: 'Now we need to ensure it's not just words of condemnation, but that action is taken, and China does have a particular position in this.'They have leverage on North Korea, and I believe we should be encouraging China to exercise that leverage.'         Dear-anged Leader: Kim Jong-un viewed the launch of the long-range ballistic missile test on Tuesday in personThe statements by China and  Mrs May came after President Donald Trump declared that 'talking is not the answer' on North Korea. President Trump tweeted: 'The U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!'The statement raised fresh uncertainty about the Trump administration's strategy for North Korea, as the U.S. and South Korea  wrapped up their annual war games.Tens of thousands of South Korean and US troops took part in the Ulchi Freedom Guardian (UFG) joint military drills, a largely computer-simulated exercise that ran for two weeks in the South.The annual drills are viewed by nuclear-armed Pyongyang as a highly provocative rehearsal for invasion, and it always meets them with threats of strong military counteraction.North Korea has said that Tuesday's missile test was a direct response to the annual drills, calling it 'a part of the muscle-flexing' against the war games.
