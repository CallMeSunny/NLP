The crackdown on imans are said to be based on a recent speech given by Mr Chen last monthAccording to Radio Free Asia, he has ordered officials to keep close tabs on all detention and re-education centres, including those set up to re-educate so-called 'wild' imams who depart from government directives when preaching Islam.Among religious leaders imprisoned were those who continued 'religious activities', including preaching, after being sacked from their official posts.U.S.-based rights activist Suleiman Gu who confirmed reports of the alleged crackdown told the Mailonline: 'It's China's nationwide policy to redefine all religions by communist standards and brainwash all clerics. 'When I was a kid, I was taught Party was more important than God. They use their Big-Brother-approved theology to prove that.'          China's tense north-west Xinjiang province is home to the Muslim ethnic Uighur minorityDilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress group, told Radio Free Asia: 'The tightening of controls over these [detention centres and re-education centres] is a sign of how Uighurs are increasingly being targeted for persecution,''The wild imams are being subjected to full-on, forcible brainwashing right now, and re-education in a sealed environment, to persuade them to totally relinquish their religious beliefs,' he said.Raxit also said the government is also clearly worried about a violent backlash to the incarceration of Uighurs and other ethnic groups with overseas links in recent months.
