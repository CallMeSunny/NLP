When the elevated bus was first unveiled to the public, some called it a fantasy while others branded it as revolutionary. But now the dream of China's straddling bus is over, with images showing the test site being completely demolished this week. The entire site is set to be demolished by the end of this month following claims that the organisers were using the project to make money for themselves.          A Chinese worker demolishes the special tracks made for the test drive of the elevated bus         A Transit Elevated Bus runs on tracks on September 7 in Qinhuangdao, China                A worker pours cement into the cracks where the rails for the bus once were   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       At least 29 people are killed and 60 wounded in car bomb...

 The elevated bus was hailed as a revolutionary tool to cut down on traffic issues in larger cities when it was first unveiled.   The 22-metre-long, 7.8-metre-wide and 4.8-metre-high TEB1 had the ability to carry up to 300 passengers, passing over traffic allowing it to pass freely underneath. It was tested in Qinhuangdao City by tebtech, a company that helped build the TEB. At the time it attracted interest from governments in Brazil, France, India and Indonesia. The idea was that passengers sit far above other vehicles on the road allowing cars to pass underneath.                          A temporary station was even installed for the futuristic bus which was later scrappedEngineers had hoped that the design would have increased the availability of the road space and cause fewer traffic jams than regular buses. However plans for the bus came to a halt with workers pictured this week demolishing the test site. Dwnews reported that the station will be scrapped however the bus will be kept for further consultation.                 The transit elevated bus is kept under an iron shed in Qinghuangdao, ChinaAccording to China News Service, it's thought that the contract between the developer and local government is set to expire next month and it will not be renewed. Demolition of the track has been left down to the local government. Staff have been let go from their posts.  State-run Global Times has been critical of the bus' source of funding which came from peer-to-peer investment platforms.  There have been suspicions of investment fraud in the project. The project was actually run by Beijing-based online peer-to-peer lending platform, Huaying Kailai which has been accused of raising money illegally from the public. It was thought that some plans hadn't been thought through as it was unclear how the bus would navigate corners and sharp turns.
