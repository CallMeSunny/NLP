         Dejian Zeng, a second year masters student at NYU, spent six weeks in 2016 working at an iPhone factory in ChinaTwelve-hour days, six-day weeks, and all for $450 per month - these were the conditions faced by an NYU student as he went undercover in an iPhone factory.Dejian Zeng, a second year masters student, spent six weeks living and working the Pegatron iPhone Factory, outside Shanghai, in order to see what life was like.While he said some things were better than expected - as the factories are clean and air-conditioned - he revealed the hours were punishing and the bosses cruel.Speaking to Mashable, he said getting a job at the factory was simple - he walked up to the gate with his ID and recited the English alphabet and they let him inside.Once there, he was assigned a spot on the production line alongside around 200 others, producing a total of 3,600 phones per day.His job was affixing speakers to the case for the iPhone 6s, and later the iPhone 7, using a single screw.Every day, starting at 7pm and going through the night, he was expected to tighten 1,800 screws over the course of ten and a half hours, meaning one screw roughly every 23 seconds.         Zeng worked in this factory, on a production line of roughly 200 people, and said they produced around 3,600 phones per day         Workers get a 10 minute break in the morning, 50 minutes for lunch and another 30 minutes for dinner - and spend as much of that time as possible sleepingIn total, he spent 12 hours in the factory per day, including a ten minute morning break, 50 minutes for lunch, and then 30 minutes in the evening for dinner. Most of them spend as much of that time as possible sleeping in order to keep up with the workload, he told Business Insider.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       You're doing it wrong, Mom: Bewildered son reveals how his...

 Most of the workers live in basic accommodation around 10 minutes from the factory, sleeping eight to a room and sharing one toilet and shower room per floor.While accommodation is paid for by the factory, food is not, and could cost up to $4 per day - with workers generally only paid between $400 and $450 per month.Zeng said the factory is not a sweat-shop, but he was shocked that workers are forced to take overtime, and are unable to opt-out.         While he said the factories themselves were surprisingly since, he added that the hours were long and the bosses could be cruel         Li said workers are all provided with phones and are allowed to watch one free video per day on them, supplied by the company, but must pay to access moreIf workers do have a complaint, they have to go through the factory owners first who decided whether or not the complaint will be passed to Apple - with most of them being blocked, Zeng said.He also recalled one boss shouting at a particular worker over the course of two days, before stopping the entire production line and making everyone watch as he yelled at the employee for taking too long.While Zeng said most workers are happy to have a job, he would like to see conditions improve, and will be advocating for that after coming back to the US.He said boycotting companies over their labor will not help, but thinks more pressure should be put on the likes of Apple to enforce good working conditions.
