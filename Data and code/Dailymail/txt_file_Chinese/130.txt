An Australian businessman believes the baby formula war wouldn't exist in Australia right now if manufacturers kept up with demand.Dr Matthew McDougall launched the Australia China Daigou Association earlier this year to improve public awareness about the fast growing and controversial Daigou-to-Consumer trading practice and improve relations.The aim is to connect Daigou buyers with manufacturers so they can buy directly from businesses instead of stripping from pharmacy and supermarket shelves and leaving limited supplies for frustrated parents who need but can't access it.While the Daigou practice is used in many product markets, it's the baby formula market where its most visible due to a critical supply shortage, which has sparked outrage among Australian parents.Scroll down for video          The association hopes to connect Daigou buyers with manufacturers so they can buy directly them instead of stripping from store shelves'Daigou are doing it in such a way that it's impacting on Australian consumers and there has to be a better way,' Dr McDougall told Daily Mail Australia.'We are determined to stop the bad practices, which are harming everyone.'It's estimated there are 80,000 daigou shoppers in Australia.

 Supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths took drastic measures earlier this week to move the product behind the counter to stop raiders from stocking up.The two-can limit per customer rule remains to ensure mothers parents can find the necessary formula for their children.         Australia China Daigou Association president Dr Matthew McDougall told Daily Mail Australia that manufacturers have a responsibility to provide to all consumersDr McDougall wants to dispel the biggest misconception about Daigou shoppers, whose reputations are damaged by a minority clearing store shelves and selling formula for profit online overseas.'It's an embarrassing and frustrating assumption that is not accurate,' he told Daily Mail Australia.'Some are motivated by profit but most are doing it to send tins back home to friends and family. 'As an association, we need to create opportunities for manufacturers to work directly with the Daigou community and improve the way Daigou shoppers go about purchasing and shipping items to their buyers back in mainland China.'         Coles and Woolworths supermarkets have moved the popular A2 and Aptamil product off the shelves to behind the counterHe warned against pointing the finger at Chinese buyers and believes the problem wouldn't exist if suppliers kept up with demand.'Australian manufacturers have a responsibility to provide to all consumers,' he told Daily Mail Australia.'Daigou fundamentally understand they can't continue to source baby formula from shelves en masse but their options are limited.'       Several small scale manufacturers have expressed interest in working with the association.'But Daigou shoppers want the most popular brands such as A2,' Dr McDougall said.Meanwhile, a mother who struggles to find baby formula has confronted workers in a warehouse full of dozens of boxes of the formula.The warehouse, Sunny Gift, located in Queensland, is filled from wall-to-wall with the rare baby formula all being prepped to be shipped off to China.Katherine and her partner Aaron recorded the moment they entered the store asking whether they were selling any baby formula.         The warehouse, Sunny Gift, located in Queensland, hoards dozens of boxes of baby formula         The workers are seen prepping the boxes of popular baby formula to ship off to China'Do you sell baby formula from here? Because I need some,' Katherine asks the supplier Jenny Li. Ms Li is seen shaking her head at Katherine's question.'Oh okay, did you have an online store or something?' Katherine continued. Both Katherine and Aaron are furious at having to shop around for baby formula for their grandchild.'It makes me really angry because this is a necessary product,' she told Nine News.  'Our children are our future, so let’s look after them, we have to feed them.'We cant keep shipping this product if we don’t have enough supplies for our kids here.'         Katherine and her partner Aaron (pictured) are furious at not being able to find formula for their grandchild         Jenny Li, the supplier of Sunny Gift, does not sell baby formula to Australians, as she is hoarding them to send to China and sell them for a higher price         Ms Li says the baby formula is very easy to find in Australia, which makes it easier for her businessMs Li seemed indifferent when she was asked about the baby formula being hard to find in Australia.She said it's easy to find and easy to buy here. There may not be a solution for the shipping of baby formula to China, because as long as the shop is licensed, it is perfectly legal.           They still have the two-can limit per customer rule to ensure mothers will be able to find the necessary formula for their children
