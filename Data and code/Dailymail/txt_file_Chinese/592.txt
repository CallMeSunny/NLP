 Nie Xuesheng, a farmer, first thanked his government after a reporter from The Beijing News read him the latest decision, as a news clip shared by QQ.com shows. A teary Nie Xiusheng told the reporters: 'Thank you, Xi Jinping the General Secretary (of the Communist Party of China) for ruling the country according to laws, bringing me huge benefit.'The father also said: 'Justice would come sooner or later.'The decision, made by the China's Supreme Court on December 2, was released through China's state-run Xinhua News Agency. Judges officially cleared Nie Shubin, who was convicted of rape and murder and was executed in 1995 at the age of 20.  Nie Xuesheng had reportedly attempted a suicide after his son's execution, which led him to suffer from hemiparesis.Sitting beside Nie Xuesheng, his daughter, Nie Shubin's sister, cried loudly on his shoulder.Nie Shubin's mother, Zhang Huanzhi, attended the court session held in Shenyang today. The 73-year-old woman filed an appeal to the court after Wang Shujin confessed to the crimes of which her son was convicted. The determined woman had said she never believed her son 'would commit such crimes'.              Nie Xuesheng, a farmer, thanked his government after a reporter read him the latest decision       Nie Xuesheng, father of wrongly convicted Nie Shubin, said 'my son can finally rest in peace'Nie Shubin's case has drawn wide attention in China to problems in the legal system as well as the frequent application of the death penalty.Nie Shubin, a factory worker, was accused of raping and killing a woman, surnamed Kang, on the outskirts of Shijiazhuang in August of 1994.Another man, Wang Shujin, confessed to the crimes in 2005 while in police custody, although a legal review of the case did not get underway until 2014.In its ruling on December 2, China's Supreme Court cited numerous examples of negligence and procedural errors by police and prosecutors, including the fact that Nie Shubin was singled out as a suspect 'without a shred of evidence.'It also said it couldn't rule out that Nie's testimony was coerced by torture or other means, a frequent accusation against the legal system that relies heavily on confessions to gain convictions.China ordered speeded-up trials and executions during anti-crime campaigns in the 1990s, leading to frequent cutting of corners by legal authorities. Two years ago, another court ruled that 18-year-old Huugjilt, an ethnic Mongolian who was executed in 1996 for rape and murder, also was innocent after another man confessed to the crime. The court awarded Huugjilt's parents compensation.However, under reforms in recent years, all death penalties are now automatically reviewed by the Supreme Court and the justices say executions are carried out only for the most heinous crimes. The exact number of people put to death is a state secret, but rights groups say China remains the world's top executioner.         Wang Shujin (pictured), who had confessed to the crimes, stood trial in Hebei in 2013         Nie Shubin's mother, Zhang Huanzhi (pictured), filed an appeal to the court after Wang admitted to the crimes of which her son was convictedChinese legal scholar Xu Xin, a prominent advocate of legal reforms to reduce wrongful convictions, said Nie's case has emerged as highly representative of the country's problems with miscarriages of justice.'In China's legal and social spheres, this case has garnered the greatest concern and has the most influence. Everyone's views on this case have basically been the same — that there was grave injustice,' Xu said.But the fact that it took this long for him to be exonerated shows the challenges ordinary people face in gaining legal redress in China, he said. 'A vindication like this implies that compensation would have to be made, and someone could potentially be held responsible for the mistake, so that makes authorities unwilling to make an active push to correct the injustice,' he said.He credited the Chinese media, concerned defense lawyers and others who drew attention to the case for the court's overturning of the verdict, but said that the problem at the heart of the issue remained China's lack of an independent judiciary.'The police, prosecutors and the court mainly cooperate with each other, not as checks against each other, defense lawyers aren't able to play their roles fully, while officials can easily interfere in cases. These all contribute to wrongful convictions,' Xu said.
