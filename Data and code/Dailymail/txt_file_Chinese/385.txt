 The report says China aims to catch up to global leaders by rectifying existing issues including a lack of high-end computer chips and equipment, software and trained personnel.It outlines strategic plans to strengthen links between private firms, research bodies and military bodies to promote mutual development in AI.         The plan comes as the United States is poised to bolster its scrutiny of investments, including artificial intelligence, over fears that countries including China could access technology of strategic military importance. A still from the film Terminator Genisys is pictured  US TO TIGHTEN GRIP ON CHINA'S INVESTMENT IN AI   The United States appears poised to heighten scrutiny of Chinese investment in Silicon Valley to better shield sensitive technologies seen as vital to U.S. national security, current and former U.S. officials tell Reuters.Of particular concern is China's interest in fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, which have increasingly attracted Chinese capital in recent years.The worry is that cutting-edge technologies developed in the United States could be used by China to bolster its military capabilities and perhaps even push it ahead in strategic industries.The U.S. government is now looking to strengthen the role of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the inter-agency committee that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies on national security grounds.An unreleased Pentagon report, viewed by Reuters, warns that China is skirting U.S. oversight and gaining access to sensitive technology through transactions that currently don't trigger CFIUS review.Such deals would include joint ventures, minority stakes and early-stage investments in start-ups. Source: Reuters It also says it will increase the role of government in guiding development of AI with policy support and market regulation as well as developing AI safety assessments and control capabilities.China has already begun investing heavily in artificial intelligence technology, including a mix of private and state-backed initiatives.Several top Chinese firms have established research bases in the U.S., including Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK).This year AI was named as a strategic technology by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in an annual report that lays out the most important leadership priorities.
