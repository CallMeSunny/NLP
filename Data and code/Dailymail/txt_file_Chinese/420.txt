The Chinese government has granted preliminary approval for nine Donald Trump trademarks it had previously rejected, the Associated Press found.Trump's decision to retain ownership of his global branding empire has sparked criticism over perceived conflicts of interest, since the trademarks would allow him to expand his business interests in industries ranging from construction to medical and veterinary services, according to theNew York Times. China's latest decision, which came on the heels of provisional approvals for Ivanka Trump trademarks, is likely to fuel further allegations that Beijing may be giving the president's family business special treatment.         The Chinese government has granted preliminary approval for nine Donald Trump trademarks it had previously rejected, the Associated Press found (above, a March 2017 file photo)         Trump's decision to retain ownership of his global branding empire has sparked criticism over perceived conflicts of interestThree lawsuits, including one filed Wednesday by nearly 200 Democrats in Congress, allege Trump has violated a constitutional prohibition against accepting gifts from foreign governments.Trademarks lie at the heart of these complaints because they are granted by foreign states and can be enormously valuable — whether they are intended as groundwork for future business activity or defensive measures against squatting to protect the value of the brand.Publicly available records do not indicate why the nine applications were initially rejected either in part or in whole. It is also unclear why the trademarks were granted provisional approval eight to 15 weeks later.'The speed with which these appeals were decided is mind-blowing,' said Matthew Dresden, an intellectual property attorney at Harris Bricken in Seattle. 'I have never seen any decisions made that quickly. That suggests special treatment. But that's just procedural. Substantively, it's impossible to say whether any of this is unusual.'China's Trademark Office did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.The new provisional approvals further shore up the president's brand in China, conferring potential rights to the use of Chinese versions of his name for beauty salon services, socks, human resources consulting and advertising, for example.If there are no objections, the marks will be formally registered after 90 days.         There are currently over 225 products being sold in China with the 'Trump' trademark that he has no association with and does not profit from (like the Trump toilet, above)China has also granted formal approval for dozens of Trump trademarks in the last few weeks, bring to 39 the total number of official registrations China has given the Trump family business since he took office, according to China's Trademark Office. Those marks include branded spa and massage services, golf clubs, hotels, insurance, finance and real estate companies, restaurants, bars, and a trademark class that covers bodyguards, social escorts, and concierge services, according to Chinese records.You Yunting, a partner at DeBund Law Offices in Shanghai, said that it's not unusual for trademark rejections to be overturned on appeal. He noted that the Trademark Office database contained no indication Trump's lawyers had actually appealed the trademark rejections, but said it can take months for such actions to be noted in the public database. He also said that if the initial denial was only partial, the Trademark Office might have let some elements of the applications progress without an appeal from the trademark holder, in which case reversals can be swift.'Considering the political element, the authorities are definitely not going to admit special treatment, but the possibility cannot be excluded,' You said. 'Even if the Trademark Office helped Trump, it would be very difficult to find the wrongdoing on the surface.'         There are 39 official registrations China has given the Trump family business since he took office, according to China's Trademark OfficeChina has defended its handling of trademarks belonging to the president and his daughter, Ivanka Trump, who has also been expanding her collection of Chinese trademarks, as fair and in line with Chinese law.All told, Ivanka Trump Marks LLC has at least 24 trademarks that were granted provisional or full approval in China, plus 43 pending marks and three invalid marks, according to Trademark Office database records.At least seven of those trademark approvals were published after March 29, when Ivanka Trump announced she would become a federal employee, serving as an adviser to her father.Around that time, her company, Ivanka Trump Marks LLC, applied to the Chinese government for at least 14 new trademarks. Her brand has said the trademarks were all filed defensively, to protect her name against squatters.

          Ivanka Trump has also been expanding her collection of Chinese trademarks.          At least seven of those trademark approvals were published after March 29, when Ivanka Trump (pictured during a dinner with Chinese President Xi JinPing in April) announced she would become a federal employee       Trump Organization lawyer Alan Garten wrote that the company had filed 117 trademark applications in China and said that while some trademarks had been granted provisional approval none have been formally registered since 2015.But records from China's Trademark Office indicate that from Feb. 14 through June 7 of this year, 39 trademarks have been formally registered. In addition, the public database lists a total of 126 trademark applications made by Donald J. Trump and four applications in the name of his company DTTM Operations LLC.Garten said in an email that ownership of 122 Chinese trademarks had been transferred to DTTM Operations in January, but did not explain how that was possible if only 117 applications had been filed. He also cautioned that China's trademark database can be unreliable.'That database is not frequently updated and is widely known to contain a multitude of inaccuracies,' he said in an email.
