Their favourite is said to be the shoots collected at altitudes higher than 6,560ft in Bashan Mountain. Cool rooms: During summer, all pandas enjoy air-conditioned rooms. Last July, a panda in Taipei Zoo tricked zookeepers into giving her an air-conditioned room, round-the-clock care and extra bamboo by pretending she was pregnant.Free match-making service: A keeper at the Chengdu centre said in an interview last year that she got up at 6am every day to match-make female and male pandas during the mating seasons. Source: Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, QQ.com
