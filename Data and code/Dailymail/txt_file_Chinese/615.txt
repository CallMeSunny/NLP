They argued that it wouldn't be economical to produce fake rice out of plastic.As one commentator said: 'The plastic materials are much more expensive than rice.'This is not the first time China has been linked to toxic rice.In 2011, plastic rice was reported in the Chinese city of Nanjing after an elderly woman saw dozen of white grains floating on the water as she washed the rice, Xinhua reports.In May 2015, a plastic rice scare broke out in Indonesia and the suspect grains were reportedly imported from China.However, the Indonesian official also doubted if the counterfeit business was profitable as the cost of producing plastic rice was greater than natural rice.
