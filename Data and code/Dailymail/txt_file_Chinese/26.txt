 The price of the caterpillar fungus, called 'yarchagumba', has skyrocketed in recent years due to its scarcity and huge market demand. It can fetch up to three times the price of gold in Beijing, researchers from the Stanford University have said. But now the Chinese anti-corruption watchdog is cracking down on the gifting of the sought-after natural aphrodisiac in its source region.A three-month-long campaign has been launched by the Commission for Discipline Inspection in the province of Qinghai near Tibet, where the fungus can be found and is regarded as a 'regional specialty'.           Tibetan men are pictured selling the prized fungus at a market in Yushu, a county-level city of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in the southern part of Qinghai province, China         The best caterpillar fungus are said to be those which are harvested deep in the mountains from areas with an altitude of 4,000 metres (13,123 feet) or above on the Tibetan PlateauThe Chinese anti-corruption authority is targeting four types of 'problematic behaviour' involving the expensive fungus, including using public funds to purchase it and receiving it as gifts, according to an online statement released on March 18.Officials in the regions are also banned from giving it as a gift, interfering the trading of it and running a business involving it.  The authority has imposed the same restrictions on Kunlun Jade, a type of pale-coloured gemstone native to Qinghai and desired by the rich and powerful in China.  What is the 'Himalayan Viagra'?          People in China believe the caterpillar fungus, billed as the 'Himalayan Viagra', can help treat anything from coughs, joint pain to impotence. They add it to stews and broths The fungus billed as the 'Himalayan Viagra' in Asia is called caterpillar fungus, or Yarsagumba. It's native to high-altitude mountainous regions in south-western China, Nepal and India.Its name translates as 'winter insect and summer plant' in Mandarin and is known formally as Ophiocordyceps sinensis.It has been considered as a medicinal food in the field of traditional Chinese medicine for centuries and is often added to stews, broths and teas.The best caterpillar fungus are those collected deep in the mountains in areas higher than 4,000 metres (13,123 feet) above sea level in early summer, according to the Traditional Chinese Medicine Web.It can help treat anything from coughs, joint pain to impotence, the website claims.   However, over-harvesting and climate change have caused the number of the fungus to dwindle in recent years, according to Stanford University.This means the fungus is becoming a winning present for those who want to please officials in power in China.   Chinese President Xi Jinping has presided over a sweeping corruption crackdown since coming to power in 2012, vowing to target both 'tigers' and 'flies', referring to elite officials and ordinary bureaucrats.The campaign has led to the jailing or punishment of thousands of officials and also brought down dozens of senior party and military officials.The anti-corruption effort has not only focused on issues like bribery and using public money to fund lavish lifestyles. It has also taken aim at those whose political loyalty is found lacking or who express doubt in public about party policies.The latest high-profile Chinese figure to be accused of corruption is Meng Hongwei, the former chief of Interpol, or The International Criminal Police Organization based in Lyon, France.China has said that it will prosecute Meng for graft after an investigation found he spent 'lavish' amounts of state funds, abused his power and refused to follow Communist Party decisions.
