 The controversial case has sparked an outcry among the Chinese public, with many doubting whether or not they would choose to be a good samaritan again.The incident took place in January, 2017, in Tangshan, northern China's Hebei Province. Mr Zhang reportedly crashed into another motorcycle behind him before escaping the scene in Luannan County. Upon seeing the scene, Mr Zhu started chasing Mr Zhang.The son of late Mr Zhang claimed that his father had told Mr Zhu he would kill himself after seeing him keep chasing him in a car, reported China Daily, quoting Legal Evening News. The report didn't explain how Mr Zhang had expressed his suicidal intentions.         Chinese media have released a video showing the last moments of Mr Zhang as he was hit by a train. Mr Zhang's son has accused Mr Zhu of causing his father to die and asked for money         Mr Zhu (pictured) told local media that he felt he had been wrongly accused because he was simply trying to do good deeds. The man was demanded to pay 600,000 yuan (£67,000)Apparently, Mr Zhang's son, whose name has not been revealed, also claimed that his father didn't stop while being chased because he worried Mr Zhu would demand 'hush fees' from him. Mr Zhang's son brought a lawsuit against Mr Zhu in October, 2017, and demanded 609,803.5 yuan (£67,854) from Mr Zhu to cover the funeral fees and living expenses, among others. Mr Zhu told Chinese media he felt he had been wrongly accused because he was simply trying to do good deeds, according to a video report on CCTV.com.Mr Zhu told the reporter that he saw Mr Zhang knocking down a pedestrian before driving away. He claimed he had called the police a few times and was told by the officers to chase the suspect.The same video footage shows Mr Zhu told Mr Zhang to turn himself by rail tracks. Both men had got off their vehicles and appeared to be walking.          The screen shot shows Mr Zhang walking along train tracks before being killed by a locomotiveThe Chinese media have released the final moments of Mr Zhang. In the video, taken by a camera on the train, the man was seen slowly walking towards the locomotive.CCTV.com said the footage was taken about 30 minutes after the apparent hit-and-run accident. It remains unclear whether or not Mr Zhu was still chasing Mr Zhang.Mr Zhu's lawyer said the footage showed Mr Zhang was not being closely chased at the time.The lawyer said the focus of the case would be whether or not it is illegal to chase someone and if Mr Zhu's chasing was the direct cause of Mr Zhu's death. The case has sparked an outcry among the Chinese public, with people expressing different opinions. While many said it makes them wonder if they should fight for justice, others said Mr Zhu should not have chased the suspect by himself as a civilian.The case is being heard at the Luannan County Court in Tangshan city.
