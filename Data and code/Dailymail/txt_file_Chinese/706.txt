         Olympic athlete Shi Donpeng, who was robbed of his luggage and thrown up on after arriving in the Rio for the OlympicsAn Olympic athlete and his accompanying cameraman have been robbed of their luggage at a Rio hotel during a carefully designed theft which started with them being vomited on.Chinese hurdler Shi Donpeng had just arrived at his hotel in Brazil ahead of the start of the Olympics on Friday and was exhausted after the long journey from China.As he waited in line in the hotel lobby to check into his room alongside the cameraman, they left their luggage and camera equipment on the ground beside them.However, a seemingly drunk man then ran into the hotel and rushed towards Shi before throwing up over him and running away.And according to the International Sport Press Association, while the athlete went to find the nearest bathroom in order to clean up, the cameraman gave chase to the drunk, and ran out of the hotel to try and find him.However, less than a minute later when the cameraman returned to the hotel lobby, he found that all of their luggage was gone.And to make matters worse, when they went to the nearest police station to report the crime, they were forced to wait in a queue for two hours due to the sheer amount of people who also claimed they too had been mugged.
