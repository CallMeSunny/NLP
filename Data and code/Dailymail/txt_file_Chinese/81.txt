 The footage was filmed early in the morning last Friday. It is alleged that the incident occurred in southern China's Guangdong Province. The woman is said to be living in Tangkent town, Fengshun county.Every year, thousands of pet dogs are poisoned and stolen in China, and as many as 20 million dogs are killed to satisfy the dog meat industry.Dog snatchers often drive a van and use a lasso to catch pet or stray dogs.Toxic darts are sometimes used too. In those cases, the thieves would go back to the location to collect the dogs' body after they are poisoned.Dog theft is particularly common in southern parts of China, including Guangxi and Guangdong provinces.          The van drives away after the man failed to drag away the pet dog in front of its home         The pooch runs back to the alleyway to play after her owner saved it from being lassoed awayIn February, a suspected dog thief was brutally attacked by residents of Fengshun after being caught stealing their pets.

'That's also why dog meat is thought to be especially nutritious to the human body.'Mr Guo added that the weather could get humid in southern China during winter, and according to traditional Chinese medicine, humidity could weaken one's health. That's why locals like eating warm dog stew to boost their immune system. Mr Guo said he lost five pet dogs to dog thieves when he was growing up in Guangdong.He condemned the thieves' behaviour. 'For the dog owners, the stolen dogs are their friends and family, and they shouldn't be the food in someone else's mouth.'
