The Beijing subway system is looking to install facial recognition technology at its stations this year as part of a measure to strengthen security checks. Once implemented, the facial recognition cameras could speed up the stations' security inspection procedures and streamline passenger flow, according to state media.Currently, all Beijing metro stations are equipped with metal detectors and X-ray scanners for luggage. People travelling with beverages would be asked to take a sip in front of security staff.          The Beijing subway system is looking to install bio-recognition technology at its stations this year to speed up passenger flow as well as to strengthen security measures (file photo)         A guard scans a passenger during a security check as other passengers queue to have their belongings scanned in an X-ray machine at a Beijing subway station (file photo)   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Cheers to no missiles!

Last September, China installed over 20 million security cameras (file photo)The cutting-edge network, aims to identify any one of its 1.4 billion citizens within three seconds. Last September, the Chinese government installed over 20 million security cameras across the nation.This has led to civil rights groups and residents stoking concerns on privacy intrusion as well as the country's push to consolidate state surveillance powers.Song Chuanyou, a 31-year-old Beijing resident, has reservations on the implementation of the new technologies on the city's train lines. 'I don't think having facial recognition cameras or palm scanners would speed up the process a lot,' he said. 'I am worried about my privacy as all of my personal information would be on file.''I would feel more comfortable if the personal information recorded is deleted after each trip,' he added. 'I don't mind my information being used to streamline passenger flow and gather data for foot traffic - as long as the process is transparent.'How is China building the world's most powerful facial recognition system?China has been aiming to build the world's most powerful facial recognition system. The cutting-edge network aims to identify any one of its 1.4 billion citizens within three seconds. The project was launched by the Ministry of Public Security in 2015. It is under development in collaboration with a security company based in Shanghai.  Last September, China installed over 20 million security cameras across the nation.          A Chinese police officer wears a pair of smartglasses with a facial recognition system at Zhengzhou East Railway Station in Zhengzhou in China's central Henan provinceHigh-tech sunglasses: Police at Zhengzhou, central China use sunglasses equipped with facial recognition technology to spot criminal suspects at train stations. On the road: Traffic police in Shenzhen has implemented 40 sets of surveillance cameras dubbed 'robocops' to identify the faces of unruly drivers and regulate traffic.At pedestrian crossings: Jaywalkers in Shenzhen would receive an instant notification and a fine as soon as they violate the rules. Images and names of people crossing the road against red traffic lights would get projected onto large LED screens.
