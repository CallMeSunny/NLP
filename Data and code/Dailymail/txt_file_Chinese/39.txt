Homebuyers in a Chinese city must promise to never keep pet dogs before being allowed to buy flats developed by a major real estate company.Customers must sign a 'no-dog agreement' with Ding Xing Group if they wish for a home in the firm's new high-end residential complex in the city of Yuncheng, central China's Shanxi Province.According to the company, the ban could help build a 'safe', 'elegant' and 'harmonious' living environment as well as preventing potential quarrels between neighbours.

 The residential area, called Golden Embankment Estate, occupies 550,000 square metres and is situated in northern Yuncheng. Apartments sell for around 7,000 yuan (£790) per square metre. The developer told Beijing Youth Daily that policy could help turn the complex into a 'no-dog estate' and all interested clients would be informed of the requirement before signing a house-purchasing contract.A spokesperson said Ding Xing Group had developed and managed residential housing in Shanxi since 2005 and the most difficult work for them was to deal with the conflicts between dog-owning residents and non-dog-owning residents, according to a report on People's Daily.

One worker from the estate's property management office told Pear Video that the policy was launched on July 1, 2017, and was applied on all buildings developed by Ding Xing Group.The female worker said all customers would need to sign 'a declaration of being civilised', which 'can eliminate the existence of pet dogs from the source'. She also claimed that the company 'had sacrificed a large part of the market' in order to realise a 'no-dog estate'.         A female worker at the firm told Pear Video they were hoping to build a 'no-dog estate' The news has sparked a debate on Chinese social media. Many web users seem to support the developer and some say the policy should be promoted to other cities.A top-rated comment reads: 'This is a good method. Those who don't have dogs live in one estate, those who have dogs and put their pets on lease live in one estate and those who have dogs and don't use a leash live in one estate. There won't be any argument because everyone is the same.'But other people say the policy is not 'humane' and it has not thought about residents who might need a guide dog. One commentator argued that if the developer was this cautious, it should 'ask all customers and their relatives to provide a no criminal record certificate'.   Multiple cities in China have set new rules and policies on dog-keeping. Authorities claim the move could improve public safety and ease the tension between those who have pets and those who don't.

In addition, many people are unaware of the responsibility that comes with a dog.Some of the most frequent complaints against pet dogs in China are that they are noisy, they bite people and their owners don't clean after them.The city of Jinan in east China last year launched a dedicated 12-point scoring system on dog owners to ensure their pets 'behave well' while in public.       Jinan residents are expected to always keep their dogs on a leash, carry their dog license and prevent the animals from barking excessively; or points would be taken from their 'dog owning account'.Once a dog owner loses all 12 points, the authority has the right to detain the dog and send the offender to a class to learn how to become a good pet owner.Last month, a new policy to ban pet owners in Wenshan city from walking their dogs from 7am to 10pm sparked a nation-wide outcry.Government of the southern Chinese city claimed the rule could improve the living conditions of its residents and maintain public safety.Foshan, on the other hand, has proposed to monitor the behaviour of dog owners and their pets using the nation-wide social credit scheme.The city in southern Guangdong Province is considering adding or removing points from the dog owners' social credit accounts depending on how well their pets behave.
