A GOP candidate has defended calling Mitch McConnell's father-in-law a 'Chinaperson', saying he did not think it was racist. Don Blankenship made the remark during a radio interview earlier this week when he said he was suspicious about how much the US is working with China given McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, and his ties to the country. 'I don't have an issue with China, I have an issue when the father-in-law is a wealthy Chinaperson and there’s a lot of connections to some of the brass, if you will, in China,' he said. He was referring to The Hon. James Chao, McConnell's father-in-law and the father of Transport Secretary Elaine Chao. During a primary debate on Tuesday, Blankenship, who is running for West Virginia Senate, defended the remark.  'This idea that calling somebody a "Chinaperson," I mean, I’m an American person.          Don Blankenship, 68, is running in for the West Virginia Senate. On Tuesday night, during a primary debate, he defended calling Dr. James Chao a 'Chinaperson'          Chao (center) is the father of US Transport Secretary Elaine Chao and the father-in-law of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (left).

That’s not any slander there,' he said. He repeated his earlier comment that McConnell had a 'conflicts of interest' with China, alleging that his relationship with his in-laws affects his ability to be impartial   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       'God damn you to hell!': Former Trump campaign consultant...

 It is not his first criticism of McConnell. Last week, Blankenship released a television ad calling him 'cocaine Mitch'. He defended that comment too on Tuesday in a press release where he explained: 'Mitch McConnell's father-in-law, who founded and owns a large Chinese shipping company, has given Mitch and his wife millions of dollars over the years.         Elaine Chao is pictured with President Trump last June. Blankenship says her husband's ties to her Chinese family is a conflict of interest          Dr. Chao is a Republican donor and philanthropist who founded the shipping company Foremost Maritime in the 1980s. He emigrated to the US from China as a student        'The company was implicated recently in smuggling cocaine from Colombia to Europe, hidden aboard a company ship carrying foreign coal was $7 million dollars of cocaine and that is why we’ve deemed him “Cocaine Mitch.”'He believes McConnell is 'indebted' to China and to his father-in-law and that it is compromising him politically.          Blankenship served a year in jail in 2016 for violating federal mining safety standards while he was at the helm of Massey Energy The cocaine incident he referred to involved the seizure of 90lbs of cocaine from a Foremost Maritime ship in Santa Marta, Colombia, in 2014.The ship was due to set sail to the Netherlands with the drugs on board. Foremost Maritime is owned by the Chao family. Dr. Chao, who founded the company in the 1980s, serves as an honorary chairman. Two of his six daughters sit on its board.   Elaine Chao was sworn in as the US Secretary for Transportation in January 2017. She previously worked as a member of President George W. Bush's administration and has been married to McConnell since 1993. Despite the fact that McConnell serves as the Senator for Kentucky and he is running in West Virginia, Blankenship is fixated on him and is hinging much of his campaign on his apparent faults. In addition to 'cocaine Mitch', he has nicknamed him 'Swamp master McConnell.'Blankenship, 58, is not without his own controversy. In 2016, he was sentenced to a year in jail for conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards after 29 men were killed by an explosion at Upper Big Branch belonged to his company, Massey Energy.           29 men were killed by an explosion which ripped through the Upper Big Branch in West Virginia in 2010
