Netflix, the entertainment streaming giant, has given up on its goal of cracking the world's largest market, China – at least for the time being.The company that conquered the film and television industry with such hits as House of Cards said the red tape and government censorship have prevented it from offering its services in the world's most populous country.'The regulatory environment for foreign digital content services in China has become challenging,' Netflix said in its third-quarter letter to shareholders. 'We now plan to license content to existing online service providers in China rather than operate our own service in China in the near term.'News of the letter was reported by financial news site MarketWatch.
