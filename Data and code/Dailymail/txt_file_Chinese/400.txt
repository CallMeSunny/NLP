 The three-minute video was produced by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT). It will be shown from now up until the 19th People's Congress this coming autumn. During the People's Congress, President Xi will start his second five-year term as President. According to state-media, the video aims to help people better understand party policies.  It includes famous Chinese actors such as Jackie Chan, Angelababy and recent Rogue One and IP man actor Donnie Yen.  Jackie Chan tells the audience: 'The country is good, the people are good, everyone will be good. Everyone fight for the Chinese dream, only then can you get the dream to come true. The power of the Chinese dream.'          Donnie Yen reads a quote from Mao Zedong in the video shown before a feature filmThe video starts out with patriotic music before saying: 'The Chinese dream is an international dream, people's dream, everyone's dream.' Chinese actress Li Bingbing can be heard saying: 'No matter what you do, as long as you respect the country, our society, our nation and our family, you are helping us to realise the Chinese dream.'A cinema employee in Beijing told the Global Times: 'Many came late for the movie just to avoid the short video and others complained about the video after watching the movie.' Many people have commented on the video on Chinese site Weibo. One user said: 'We must work hard together to create the Chinese dream!'While another wrote: 'The Chinese dream is the dream of every Chinese person and we should encourage it.'   China makes further crackdown on its internet to curb anything that doesn't fall in line with socialist values         All content posted on the internet is to be checked that it is in line with socialist valuesThe advert comes as China announces further measures to crack down on the country's internet. Over the past month, Chinese regulators have closed gossip websites and restricted what videos people can post on the grounds of inappropriate content. Last week, an industry association circulated new regulations that require all audiovisual content posted online to be checked. Documentaries, micro movies, sports and educational material will all have to adhere to core 'socialist values.'   Topics deemed not in line with these values include drug addiction and homosexuality.
