He was detained by the local public security bureau on May 15.  According to People's Daily, late firefighter Xie's family decided not to sue Zeng for defamation. Therefore, the People's Procuratorate of Jiangsu Province filed a lawsuit Zeng on May 21, demanding Zeng stop the 'harming behaviour immediately' and make public apologies through media to eliminate the ill effects.
