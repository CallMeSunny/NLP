He is pictured in an undated official mug shotA former CIA agent accused of helping China unravel America's intelligence network in the country eight years ago has been charged by the US Justice Department with conspiring to commit espionage.Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 53, a resident of Hong Kong, was arrested at JFK airport in January, six years after US officials found the names and numbers of covert agents inside two notebooks within his luggage.Lee is accused of handing this information to the Chinese, allowing them to unmask 'at least a dozen' CIA sources and imprison six more from 2010 to 2012 in what was seen as one of the biggest US intelligence failures in decades.'The allegations in this case are troubling,' said Tracy Doherty-McCormick, acting US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.'Conspiring with foreign agents poses a real and serious threat toward our national security.'Lee's lawyer, Edward MacMahon, has refuted the charges. 'Mr. Lee is not a Chinese spy,' MacMahon said after his client's initial court appearance in February.'He is a loyal American who loves his country' and served in the military and the CIA.         Lee (pictured right, blue tie, on October 13, 2017) at an unveiling of a painting in Christie's, Hong Kong) is accused of handing the identities of American agents to the ChineseAccording to prosecutors, two Chinese intelligence officers approached Lee in April 2010, three years after he had left the CIA, and offered to pay him for information 'relating to the national defense of the United States'.The Chinese officers allegedly provided Lee with email addresses so they could communicate covertly.Lee is a US citizen who speaks fluent Chinese. He joined the CIA in 1994 and worked in a variety of overseas offices where he was trained in surveillance detection, recruiting and handling informants and classified material.

 A court affidavit states that in 2012, Lee traveled from Hong Kong with his family to Northern Virginia. After finding two notebooks containing the names of agents, FBI interviewed Lee five times but did not directly ask him if he had worked for the Chinese government.Agents then let Lee leave the country in 2013 so he could be monitored for more evidence to prove he had committed espionage.         A court affidavit states that in 2012, Lee traveled from Hong Kong (file photo) with his family to Northern Virginia, where agents found two notebooks which named covert US agentsThe indictment alleges that Lee made 'numerous unexplained cash deposits, and repeatedly lied to the US government during voluntary interviews when asked about travel to China and his actions overseas.'Officials have not said why it took so long to bring charges against Lee, nor detailed what materials he gave to the Chinese agents.But the case takes place amid widespread concern in the US intelligence community that Beijing has been able to cripple their operations in China.The New York Times reported last year that starting in 2010, to the end of 2012, the Chinese killed 'at least a dozen' sources the CIA had inside China and imprisoned six or more others.A hunt for a 'mole' in the agency led to one person, a 'former operative' now living elsewhere in Asia, the Times said. But there was not enough information to arrest him.But others in the agency blamed sloppy work and not a mole.
