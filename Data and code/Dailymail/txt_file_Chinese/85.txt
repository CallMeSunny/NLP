Mrs Hunt was born in Xi'an, the capital of China's Shaanxi province.                 Jeremy Hunt accidentally referred to his Chinese wife as Japanese today in a bizarre gaffe as he met his counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing today (pictured)          Mr Hunt and his wife Lucia are pictured together arriving for a banquet with Donald Trump earlier this month         The couple been married to Lucia since 2009 and have three children. Mrs Hunt was born in Xi'an, the capital of China's Shaanxi province (they are pictured together at Buckingham Palace in 2016)         The visit to China is the new Foreign Secretary's first high profile outing since his sudden promotion earlier this month to replace Boris Johnson (Mr Hunt is seen left during today's talks)       Mr Hunt blamed the toe-curling gaffe on having just had a conversation with his Chinese hosts in Japanese in an apology on Twitter tonight (pictured) China and Japan have been traditional rivals for centuries. Although relations have improved somewhat recently, they remain touchy due to issues such as Japan's bloody occupation of parts of China in the 1930s and 40s.Greeting his counterpart Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Mr Hunt said: 'My wife is Japanese -- my wife is Chinese. That´s a terrible mistake to make.‘My wife is Chinese and my children are half-Chinese... they have Chinese grandparents in Xian. And strong family connections in China. In fact we came to China on holiday in April,’ he babbled.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       'Fretful, weak and incompetent': Jacob Rees-Mogg blasts the...

They married a year later in Xian in a traditional Chinese ceremony. She was working for the university helping to recruit Chinese students to come to the UK.         Mr Hunt and his wife Lucia (pictured in 2012) have three children - a son and two daughters - and were married in 2009          At a press conference following his talks (pictured) Mr Hunt welcomed support from China for a post Brexit trade deal with Britain Mr Hunt took over from the gaffe-prone Mr Johnson - who once referred to Africans as 'flag-waving piccaninnies' with 'watermelon smiles' in a newspaper column - after his dramatic resignation over Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit blueprint.Mr Hunt is in China in a bid to strengthen trade ties with Beijing ahead of Britain's exit from the European Union next year.Other topics on the table are expected to be 'the importance of multilateralism and free trade and ways the UK and China can work together on global challenges such as climate change, development, security and non-proliferation and enforcing UN sanctions on North Korea', his office said ahead of the trip.At a press conference later, Mr Hunt said: 'We discussed the offer made by Foreign Minister Wang to open discussion of a possible free-trade deal done between Britain and China, post-Brexit.'We welcome this and said that we will explore it.'He added: 'We also raised consular cases, including that of the Simpson children. Foreign Minister Wang said he would look into that case while also still respecting the independence of China's judicial system.' Why mixing up the two deadly rivals of China and Japan is such a blunderThey have been the bitterest and bloodiest of enemies for centuries. But most of the continuing hostility between China and Japan dates to more recent times.Between 1937 and 1945, the Japanese committed many war crimes after invading a large swathe of China.Perhaps the most notorious was the Rape of Nanking, when during a six-week period from mid-December 1937, the Imperial Japanese Army butchered more than 200,000 inhabitants of the city, then China’s capital, and carried out widespread rape and looting.Tokyo still refuses to accept full responsibility for the massacre, claiming the death toll was hugely exaggerated.To this day, some older Chinese citizens boycott Japanese goods in protest.The two nations also remain locked in dispute over the ownership of a group of uninhabited islands in the South China Sea off Taiwan. Since 1972, Japan has controlled what it calls the Senkaku islands, but China – which refers to them as the Diaoyu islands – disputes sovereignty.The two countries resumed high-level economic dialogue only in April, following an eight-year stand-off.Tensions remain high. Last week Japan’s defence ministry scrambled fighter jets to intercept a Chinese electronic surveillance aircraft over the Sea of Japan.
