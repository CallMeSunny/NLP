 The surprise decision by Mrs May came just three weeks after she took over from David Cameron in Downing Street.The Prime Minister's chief of staff, Nick Timothy, had previously written about the possibility that China could covertly install software which would allow it to close down the power station at will.There was speculation that Mrs May would take a markedly different approach to relations with Beijing from Mr Cameron and former chancellor George Osborne, who sought to encourage Chinese investment in the UK.However, in her letter to Mr Xi and Prime Minister Li Keqiang, Mrs May - currently on holiday in Switzerland - said Britain 'looks forward to strengthening co-operation with China on trade and business and on global issues'.On his Twitter feed, Mr Sharma said he had had a 'great first meeting' with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, with a 'warm welcome and forward-looking approach'.         David Cameron focused a great deal of energy on relations with China, including arranging a state visit by Premier Xi last year
