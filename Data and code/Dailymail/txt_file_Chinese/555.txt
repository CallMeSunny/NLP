China has rejected President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion he could use American policy on Taiwan as a bargaining chip between the two nations.The country's foreign ministry described the 'one China' policy as 'non-negotiable', in a statement released on Sunday.Since recognizing Beijing in 1979, Washington has maintained only unofficial ties with Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing considers its territory - a status quo that Trump has repeatedly threatened to upend since winning the November election.         China has rejected President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion he could use American policy on Taiwan as a bargaining chip between the two nations 'The government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing China,' spokesman Lu Kang said.'That is the fact acknowledged by the international community and no one can change.'

 The public remarks came after Trump said 'everything is under negotiation, including "one China",' in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.  The comments were the latest indication Trump will shake up the US-China relationship, particularly on Taiwan, which China considers a core national interest.                Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang described the 'one China' policy as 'non-negotiable' in a statement on Sunday         Trump had claimed on Friday in an interview that everything was up for negotiation between the two countries, including the 'one China' policyChina was already angered by Trump's phone call with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on December 2, which was the first time an American president or president-elect has publicly spoken to Taiwan's leader in nearly four decades.  WHAT IS THE 'ONE CHINA' POLICY?   The policy is an admission by countries wanting to deal with mainland China that there is only one legitimate Chinese government - ignoring Taiwan.The island claims to be independent of mainland China and refers to itself as the Republic of China, however the policy dictates any country wanting to forge diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China cannot have official ties to Taiwan.It was first recognized by the US in 1979, when president Jimmy Carter established formal diplomatic ties with Beijing. The US shuttered its embassy in Taipei as a result. The US has maintained strong 'unofficial' relations with Taiwan, however due to the policy it is not technically recognized.In fact, in the same year it officially signed onto the 'one China' policy, the US passed the Taiwan Relations Act - guaranteeing support for the island nation and pledging to defend it.   Beijing considers any reference to a separate Taiwanese head of state to be a grave insult.Trump then said in a television interview he didn't feel 'bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.'After attacking China repeatedly during his campaign, Trump has continued to disparage China on Twitter over its military build-up in disputed areas of the South China Sea, allegedly manipulating its currency to put American companies at a disadvantage, and not doing enough to curb North Korea's nuclear program. He has also announced a new White House trade council will be led by economist Peter Navarro, a sharp critic of Chinese economic policy who wrote a book titled 'Death By China.'Trump told the Journal that he would not label China a currency manipulator as soon as he takes office, though he repeated his contention that China is manipulating the yuan.So far, Beijing has reiterated its refusal to negotiate on Taiwan and to push for positive cooperation between the two sides, though state-run media have run several strongly worded editorials attacking Trump.Chinese political observers on Sunday said they expected Beijing's response to change once Trump is inaugurated next week.         It is the latest example of Trump angering China, following on from his controversial phone call with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen (pictured) on December 2         Trump has also said a new White House trade council will be led by economist Peter Navarro (pictured), a sharp critic of Chinese economic policy who wrote a book titled 'Death By China'       'Trump has not taken office yet, so he is an ordinary person now,' Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University, said. 'Therefore, there's no need for China to take his remarks seriously or further respond to what he said.'Tang Yonghong, a professor at Xiamen University, said China needed to convince Trump 'if he wants to make money from the Chinese mainland, he must be a friend of China instead of being an enemy.''I think Trump is handling international relations, including Sino-US relations, with a businessman's logic,' Tang said.'He wants to see how China will respond to such provocation.'
