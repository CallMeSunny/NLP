China's controversial stealth jet has made its first flyby, giving the public and media a glimpse of the aircraft believed to be a copy of America's F-22 and built using hacked US military blueprints.Taking to the skies at the airshow in the southern city of Zhuhai, in Guangdong province, the J-20 stealth fighter passed by onlookers in a thunderous demonstration.The aircraft is believed to have been built in part from plans of US war planes, obtained by Chinese hackers jailed earlier this year – a claim which Beijing has firmly denied.Military analysts have said it is still too early to tell if the jet matches the capabilities of the US F-22 Raptor.Scroll down for video            China's newest warplane, the J-20 stealth fighter, made its first public flight at an airshow in the southern city of Zhuhai. It bears an uncanny resemblance to US military's F-22 Raptor       Copy-cat? Pictured above is America's F-22 which shares a similar design to the J-20. China is set to overtake the US as the world's top aviation market in the next decade       After arriving as a pair at low-level, one of the J-20s quickly disappeared over the horizon, leaving the other to perform a series of turns, revealing its delta wing shape against bright sub-tropical haze.But analysts said the brief and relatively cautious J-20 routine - the pilots did not open weapon bay doors, or perform low-speed passes - answered few questions.'I think we learned very little. We learned it is very loud. But we can't tell what type of engine it has, or very much about the mobility', said Greg Waldron, Asia Managing Editor of FlightGlobal. 'Most importantly, we didn't learn much about its radar cross-section'.A key question whether the new Chinese fighter can match the radar-evading properties of the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor air-to-air combat jet, or the latest strike jet in the U.S. arsenal, Lockheed's F-35.But the mere display of such a newly developed aircraft was a revealing signal, others said.'It's a change of tactics for the Chinese to publicly show off weapons that aren't in full squadron service yet," said Sam Roggeveen, a senior fellow at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, 'and demonstrates a lot of confidence in the capability, and also a lot of pride'.But the fighter jet's development has been controversial, embroiled in claims of espionage.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Canary Islands chosen as a backup site for troubled...

          Chinese national Su Bin admitted in a plea agreement with US authorities to conspiring with two unnamed military officers in China to try to acquire plans for F-22 and F-35 fighter jets and Boeing's C-17 military transport aircraft. He was sentenced to just under four years. Pictured at the Chinese airshow is the new J-20         Spot the difference: America's F-22 (pictured)  shares many identical features  FIRST LOOK AT THE J-20 STEALTH FIGHTER    Today's flypast marks the first public flight for China's new war plane.The fighter jet is swift, stealthy, and armed with long-range missiles.Its design is similar to US fighter jets, stoking concerns that the Chinese military used 'stolen' plans obtained by hackers to develop the stealth plane and further drive its military ambitions.Experts have said that the plane represents a leap forward in China's ability to project power in Asia, and will compete with US military technology.China is set to overtake the US as the world's top aviation market in the next decade.     Earlier this year, a Chinese national, 51-year-old Su Bin, was sent to prison for his part in stealing US military plans and sending documents to Beijing.The documents were reported to include plans for the F-35 and F-22 fighter jets, which would have enabled the Chinese military to rapidly catch up with US capabilities. Airshow China, in the southern city of Zhuhai, has offered Beijing an opportunity to demonstrate its ambitions in civil aerospace and to underline its defence ambitions. China is set to overtake the US as the world's top aviation market in the next decade. Unofficial shots of a J-20 prototype fueled discussion over the region's power balance when first glimpsed by plane spotters in 2010. Experts say China has been refining designs in hopes of narrowing a military gap with Washington. Cao Qingfeng, an aircraft engineer watching the flypast, said the 'stunning' display was a show of China's strengthening aircraft industry and manufacturing - and Western officials agreed.'This shows they now have confidence to put it out in public,' said a Western industry official who has monitored the biennial show from its inception 20 years ago.'This is the airplane for China in the way that the J-31 is not; this is the one they develop for themselves,' he added. Despite the impressive show of aerial military might, some foreign observers have questioned its stealth capabilities.

But analysts note the AG600 - first unveiled 10 days after a Hague tribunal ruled against China's claim to parts of the South China Sea in July - is well suited to resupplying military outposts in the disputed area.Notably absent from the airshow schedule is the Comac C919 passenger jet, designed to compete with Europe's Airbus Group and Boeing Co of the United States, the rivals who dominate the global supply of airliners.The 150-seater C919 is scheduled to stage an often-delayed maiden flight this year, but industry sources say this will now slip to 2017 - three years behind original plans.Airbus and Boeing continue to expand in China with recent plant announcements. Boeing is expected to announce a new supplier partnership at the show.           The air show showcased China's aerial strength. Along with the latest J-20 stealth jet will be the seven-strong J-10 fighter jets of China's Bayi Aerobatic Team (pictured)         The airshow, in Zhuhai, south China's Guangdong Province, will provide a platform for Beijing to flex its long-range military muscle to the public and watching nations around the world. Pictured are the J-10 jets of the Bayi Aerobatic Team at Zhuhai airportChina's only international aerospace exhibition, held biennially in the southern city of Zhuhai, this year boasts its largest-ever display of military hardware and aircraft, with 11 exhibition halls, 430,000 square metres of indoor and outdoor viewing area, and 151 aircraft from 700 exhibitors from 42 countries and regions. China is aggressively moving to develop its domestic weapons industry, from drones and anti-aircraft systems to homegrown jet engines and hypersonic planes.Beijing has previously been accused of copying designs from Russian fighters, and analysts say its J-31 stealth fighter is very similar to the US-developed F-35. China's military focus on stealth technology remains a key issue for Beijing.Earlier this month, leaked images emerged of the military's enormous stealth warship, currently under construction at the Jiangnan Changxing shipyards.Known as a Type 005 destroyer, the vessel is believed to be armed with electromagnetic railguns capable of shooting down missiles and firing on land targets.         It was also reported in September that a Chinese firm claimed to have developed radar technology capable of detecting stealth jets (stock image used)The leaked images revealed the battle ship's progress, with signs of portals on the stern for sensors and weapons and up to 128 vertical launch system cells for missiles.It was also reported in September that a Chinese firm claimed to have developed radar technology capable of detecting stealth jets.Called the quantum radar, the technology was reportedly created by Intelligent Perception Technology, a branch of defence and electronics firm CETC.They firm claims it is capable of detecting a target at a range of 60 miles and was successfully tested last month.China has pushed for dominance in the South China Sea, following a number of contentious claims over who owns territory in the region. The two major island chains in the region, the Spratlys and the Paracels, have become central to the international argument, causing tensions to rise.Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines all have claims on the region, but China has surged ahead with expansive military operations, including the building of its own islands in disputed spots to stake its claim and bolster a military presence. CHINA'S WARSHIP TO BE A 'GAME CHANGER'           Asia's most powerful warship has been shrouded in mystery since construction began last year at the Jiangnan Changxing shipyards. Called Type 005 destroyer, this vessel is said to be armed with electromagnetic railguns that can shoot down missiles and attack land targets (pictured is an artist impression of Type 005)Leaked images show the Type 005 destroyer should launch late 2017 or early 2018.It has a full displacement of over 14,000 tons.And the images show the bow and stern are finished.         Now, leaked images give a glimpse of the battle ship's progress, which reveals four portals on the stern for sensors and weapons and up to 128 vertical launch system cells for missiles (pictured is an artist impression of Type 005)The bow area appears to be extremely hydrodynamic hull, endure high speeds, have stealth capabilities and is fitted with an enclosed deck.And the stern is where the creators packed all of the technology.This area has at least four sections that hold sensors and weapons like towed array sonar, variable depth sonar, towed torpedo decoys and active torpedo defenses.Because the ship is 175 meters long and is built with large displacement, the Type 005 will be capable of carry numerous helicopters at once and other technologies such as drones and underwater vehicles.
