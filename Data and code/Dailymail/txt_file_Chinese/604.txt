I will be a good wife. 'Our wedding will proceed as planned even if you can't show up, I am still happy to marry alone as I have you.'At first, Zhang's family found it difficult to accept the idea.  The bride-to-be had tried very hard to convince her family, who eventually agreed to let her proceed with the wedding.The story has attracted tens of thousands comments on Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter. Many Chinese online users criticised the groom's decision.One user said: 'It's just a SWAT competition. It's not an urgent mission. Attending his own wedding is more important.' Another one wrote: 'I won't marry this man who can't even be bothered to attend the wedding.' 'It just explains that the woman loves him a lot,' a third user said.'This policeman will be promoted very soon,' another one noted.
