 The mother, known by her surname Tang, said she had been forced to beg because she and her husband couldn't afford the expensive medical bills charged by the hospital. When reporters talked to Ms Tang at the end of January, she had just given birth a month before and her health had not fully recovered.Her husband told a reporter from Pear Video that doctors had told them to prepare at least 100,000 yuan (£11,262) should they want to save their younger child.The couple are both migrant workers and live in a tiny £79-per-month rental flat.         Ms Tang also sells her breast milk in bags to passersby in Shenzhen.

She wore a scarf to cover her face so she wouldn't be recognised.Next to them, several bags of Ms Tang's breast milk were displayed for passersby to purchase. Ms Tang said people could 'occasionally' pay her to feed their babies.          A sanitation worker walks past the couple as he looks at the signboard explaining their story         People could 'occasionally' pay Ms Tang to feed their babies at the rate of £1 per minuteAlthough life has been hard on the family, Ms Tang's husband, who is the pillar of the family, has not been discouraged by the challenges. Speaking to a Pear Video reporter from their flat, the determined man said: 'I believe as long as we try hard, we could overcome the difficulty.' The man said he would find more part-time food-delivering jobs, and her wife would go back to work in two or three months.After the story became viral on the internet, the local authorities have stepped in. In an online statement, the Shenzhen Internet Information Office confirmed that the couple's claims were true. The statement stressed that the hospital had been carrying on treating their daughter despite they couldn't pay the medical bills. The statement also said officials from local authorities have visited the couple and the authorities would provide them with suitable help allowed by the Chinese regulations.
