Today's Hong Kong, a bustling home to over seven million people, is very different from how it was in the 1950s and 1960s. At that point in time, the British colony was embracing a large inflow of immigrants from mainland China after Communist leader Mao Zedong declared the establishment of People's Republic of China in 1949.Fan Ho, an award-winning photographer, also arrived in Hong Kong in 1949 from Shanghai. From then, he used his Rolleiflex camera to capture the societal changes and rapid development of the city.         In 'Afternoon Chat', a picture taken in 1959, Fan Ho captures the group of city-dwellers chatting causally at an underpass in the emerging business district of Central. The snapshot reflects a rare glimpse in an otherwise fast-paced commercial city         People Crossing (1963): The tram was Hong Kong's earliest form of transport and is still being used today         Woks (1964): A street-side vendor is captured making a Chinese wok. At the time, Hong Kong exported the Chinese cooking utensils to overseas countries as example of industrialisationThe incredible black-and-white pictures taken by Mr Ho show a kaleidoscopic selection of Hong Kong's bygone life: city-dwellers talking at an underpass in a business district, an old woman walking down an empty alley and crowds of shoppers buying food from a wet market. Some other images herald the city's history as an important habour: a hawker pushing his cart along the water's edge in front of European style buildings and a junk sailing on serene water.Taken during the 1950s and 1960s, these are the Hong Kong images immortalised by Mr Ho, arguably the most famous photographer in the Hong Kong history who died of pneumonia last year aged 84.

 Renowned for the sense of drama heightened by the use of smoke and light, Fan Ho's work captures the tranquility of the city which was undergoing drastic changes in many ways.Under Mr Ho's lens, the streets and people of Hong Kong turned into a 'living theatre'.His work alongside his vintage camera were recently put on display at Sotheby's Hong Kong Gallery, with images courtesy of Blue Lotus Gallery who exclusively represented Mr Ho's photographs.         Fan Ho's On The Stage of Life was taken in 1954, showcasing the western culture flowing into Hong Kong under the British rule          The customers at Hong Kong's first indoor market in Central were perfectly captured under Mr Ho's 'Sun Rays' in 1959              In the mood for love: The mise-en-scène of the picture had a sense of cinematography under Mr Ho's lens in 1960 (left). Another picture, called Her Study (1963), revealed the daily life of children in the booming era of Hong Kong (right)Hong Kong, under British rule from 1842 to 1997, was a rare blend of East and West.  Drastic changes happened in Hong Kong in late 1940s and early 1950s due to an inflow of refugees and entrepreneurs fleeing the civil war between Kuomintang and Communist Party on the mainland, according to. Population surged quickly from around one million in 1941 to 2.5 million in 1956, then to three million in 1960.  Hong Kong quickly transformed itself from a fishing port to an industrialised economy. The most prominent example of this was the immigrants from Shanghai who created the cotton spinning industry in the colony. Hong Kong's industry was founded in the textile sector in the 1950s before gradually diversifying in the 1960s to clothing, electronics, plastics and other labor-intensive production mainly for export.As business opened up to overseas trade, the city was crowned as one of the 'Four Asian Tigers' with booming economy driven by textile exports and manufacturing industries.The government launched an ambitious public education program, creating over 300,000 new primary schools between 1954 and 1961. By 1966, 99.8 per cent of school-age children were attending primary school, although free universal primary school was not provided until 1971.          Mr Ho took a self portrait with his camera. He was wildly regarded as the most famous photographer from Hong Kong         Hong Kong turned from a fishing port to an industrialised city when a large supply of labour force immigrated to the city. The above picture was taken by Fan Ho in 1957 and is called Construction         Market Parade (1963) People were seen wearing Chinese traditional clothing and also suits, displaying a perfect blend of East and West              The government launched an ambitious public education program, creating over 300,000 new primary schools between 1954 and 1961. Mr Ho created Lost in Central (1951/2013) by combining two negatives onto a scanner to digitize it (right)Mr Ho's pictures, captured in his album 'Hong Kong Yesterday', showcased how the daily life of working class people on the street during the era.The impact of the East and West were reflected in the photos under his Rolleiflex f3.5 camera.Women in traditional Cheongsam can be seen visiting the first Hong Kong indoor market in Central; in contrast, theatres showed 'West End' musicals.         Daily Routine (1961) The start of education system: Children went to schools as the city opened up free education policy              Mr Ho's picture often displayed strong contrast of lights and shadows, as one of his characteristics in camera skills (left). A cousin of Mr Ho was asked to pose against a wall in Approaching Shadow (1954) (right)Mr Ho moved to Hong Kong from Shanghai with his family in 1949 at the age of 18. He started taking photographs of Hong Kong after he bought himself a camera.He had won over 280 awards in photography before reaching the age of 28, according to Fan Ho Trust Estate.In 1966, his first attempt as film director won him the best movie award at Banbury Film Festival in Britain.Mr Ho continued to work in the film industry and retired when he was 65 years old.He moved to San Francisco afterwards and flew back to Hong Kong to visit his family occasionally.   During one of Mr Ho's trips back to Hong Kong in the early 2010s, he said in an interview with Perspective Magazine that he could no longer find the scenes and inspiration of the old Hong Kong, the Hong Kong he had made so iconic with his still images.          'There must be humanity in art.' Photos that Mr Ho took had a special feeling to the viewers, pictured Pattern (1956)              The work life a man carrying a rickshaw was captured by Mr Ho under the photo 'A Day is Done' in 1957 (left). The influence of western culture can be seen in the buildings along the harbour in Hong Kong (right)'In the 1950s and 60s there were many back alleys, narrow streets and open markets - this time I can't even remember how to find my own streets and alleys. It is all skyscrapers and has changed to a degree that I can hardly recognise it,' he said, smiling. In one of his latest books, Fan Ho: A Hong Kong Memoir, Mr Ho dug through his old archives and put forth never-before-seen images from the 50s and 60s. But in reality, Mr Ho's Hong Kong has disappeared forever - the city has turned from a tranquil seaside port to a metropolis of gleaming skyscrapers, a home to some 7.4 million people.Colonial emblems have become a symbol of protests. Conflicts have grown over controversial political issues.              His dream (1964): The days in the 60s when people were more carefree and stress-free, as shown in the photos of Mr Ho (left). Light shining into a back alley of a Hong Kong street with a maid walking reflected a change in Hong Kong's society (right)         East Meets West (1963): Hong Kong changed dramatically under the British rule, which made it into an international cityAs Mr Ho said in an interview with SCMP in 2014, he would never click the shutter if the scene did not touch his heart.'There must be humanity in art. If you feel nothing when you click the shutter, you give the viewer nothing to respond to and you have nothing to convey.'The laid-back city Fan Ho captured has become a cherished memory of Hong Kong.And just like Mr Ho said, his classic images have not only touched his heart, but also the hearts of millions of residents of the fast-growing metropolis.
