 In Beijing, Mr Shuang said: 'China's position on developing friendly, good-neighbourly relations with North Korea is also consistent and clear.'China was unswervingly devoted to the denuclearisation of the peninsula and maintaining peace and security and resolving the issue through talks, he added.         Tensions have heightened over North Korea's nuclear programme in PyongyangChina has repeatedly said that while it is happy to help arrange talks, it is ultimately up to the United States and North Korea to sort out their differences.Diplomats say Washington and Beijing are negotiating a possible stronger UN Security Council response - such as new sanctions - to North Korea's repeated ballistic missile launches.The first statement from North Korea, issued on Wednesday through the state-backed Korean Central News Agency, said that the Chinese had attempted to shift the blame to Pyongyang for 'deteriorated relations' between China and North Korea and US deployment of strategic assets to the region.It also accused China of 'hyping up' damage caused by North Korean nuclear tests to China's three northeastern provinces.Chinese state media calls for North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program were 'a wanton violation of the independent and legitimate rights, dignity and supreme interests' of North Korea and constituted 'an undisguised threat to an honest-minded neighboring country which has a long history and tradition of friendship,' it said.The KCNA commentary said calls by 'some ignorant politicians and media persons' in China for stricter sanctions on North Korea and not ruling out military intervention if it refused to abandon its nuclear program, were 'based on big-power chauvinism'. It said North Korea's nuclear program was needed for the 'existence and development' of the country and 'can never be changed nor shaken.''The DPRK will never beg for the maintenance of friendship with China,' the commentary said.China had earlier urged both sides of the North Korean dispute to stay calm and 'stop irritating each other' and has told its citizens in the secretive state to leave in case Kim Jong-un provokes a US attack.The US has sent a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to Korean waters and a pair of strategic US bombers flew training drills with the South Korean and Japanese air forces in another show of strength this week.         The USA has urged China, North Korea's only major ally, to do more to rein its nuclear programmes, with President Trump warning the 'era of strategic patience' is over       The flight of the two bombers came as Trump raised eyebrows when he said he would be 'honoured' to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the right circumstances, and as his CIA director landed in South Korea for talks.  North Korea said the bombers conducted 'a nuclear bomb dropping drill against major objects' in its territory at a time when Trump and 'other US warmongers are crying out for making a preemptive nuclear strike' on the North.'The reckless military provocation is pushing the situation on the Korean peninsula closer to the brink of nuclear war,' the North's official KCNA news agency said on Tuesday.It comes as the Chinese Embassy in the hermit state urged citizens to leave North Korea amid fears of a missile strike as tensions rise between Kim Jong-un's regime and the US. The warning was first issued ahead of North Korea's Day of the Sun last month, when the secretive state was tipped to carry out missile tests.Dictator Kim used the occasion to demonstrate his county's military might, and an unsuccessful test was carried out on April 29.         Then-Chinese leader Mao Tse Tung and Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea, led countries whose relationship Mao said was as 'close as lips and teeth' but analysts question whether their 1961 defence pact would hold in the event of another war           The despot leader was tipped to carry out missile tests last month, culminating in a failed test on April 29A Korean-Chinese citizen told Radio Free Asia he was advised to 'stay a while' in China, and stated: 'The embassy has never given such a warning. I was worried and left the country in a hurry.'But he said most Chinese citizens in North Korea had opted not to heed the warning.It comes amid questions over whether China would honour a mutual defence pact signed with North Korea under Communist leader Mao Zedong.When the pact was signed in 1961, Mao described North Korea as 'as close as lips and teeth'.The two countries had been allies in the Korean war, between 1950 and 1953, which began after the North, under Kim Il-Sung, invaded South Korea.The current leaders of both nations, Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korea's Kim Jong-Un, have never even met.The treaty constitutes 'a very important part' of Sino-North Korean ties, professor Maochun Miles Yu, of the United States Naval Academy, told AFP.But, he added, it is 'a mystery' what would happen if conflict escalates into use of weapons.         North Korea regularly parades its military through its showcase capital of Pyongyang, but while the number of personnel is huge, observers question how effective it might be in modern armed conflict         Beijing fears that in the event of the collapse of the North Korean state, the border between their two countries would be swamped with people trying to flee to China       Trump last week called on China to distance itself from Pyongyang and support efforts to bring Kim to heel.Retired Chinese naval colonel Li Jie told the South China Morning Post last month: 'It's hard to say how China would assist North Korea militarily in case of war, since North Korea is developing nuclear weapons, an act that might have already breached the treaty between the two nations.'The military pact automatically renews every 20 years, most recently in 2001, meaning it is now valid until 2021.Last year, Xi and Kim exchanged messages to mark the treaty's 55th anniversary.The Chinese president wrote that both sides have cooperated in the 'spirit' of the treaty and that their 'friendship serves as a precious wealth'.The treaty, Kim responded, 'has become a firm legal foundation for constantly consolidating the friendly and cooperative relations that were forged in the bloody struggle for independence against imperialism and for socialism'.But in 2013, a Chinese defence ministry spokesman said it would be 'unprofessional' to answer a hypothetical question about whether Beijing would militarily back Pyongyang in an attack.Young-June Chung, an associate professor at Shanghai's Tongji University, said the pact's 'diplomatic status is a little bit obscure' as neither side has acknowledged that it is 'invalid.'But he added that Beijing 'would not sacrifice its relations with the US and South Korea for North Korea.'
