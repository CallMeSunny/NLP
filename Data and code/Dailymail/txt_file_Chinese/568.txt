Much to India's chagrin, China has yet again blocked its efforts to have Jaish-e-Muhammed chief Maulana Masood Azhar designated as a global terrorist by the United Nations. Earlier, China had put a technical hold on the sanctions list seeking more deliberations on the subject, but with barely 48 hours before the hold lapsed, China, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council blocked India's move. New Delhi hit back at Beijing saying China's decision is surprising as the country has been affected by the scourge of terrorism and had declared opposition to all forms of terror.         China has yet again blocked its efforts to have Jaish-e-Muhammed chief Maulana Masood Azhar designated as a global terrorist by the United Nations.'The international community is aware that the Pakistan-based Jaish-e- Mohammed, which is proscribed by the United Nations, has been responsible for innumerable terrorist attacks on India including the Pathankot Air Base attack.' 'The inability of the international community to list its leader Masood Azhar is an unfortunate blow to the concerted efforts to effectively counter all forms of terrorism, and this confirms prevalence of double standards in the fight against terrorism,' Vikas Swaroop, spokesperson for the external affairs ministry said. China was the only country in the 15-member UN Security council blocking sanctions against Masood Azhar. Twice this year, China has extended a technical hold on sanctions - the first time in April and the second time in October.          In the past, China has indirectly accused India of pursuing political interests in the name of countering terror, a charge India has denied.

There is an evidence in the public domain of its involvement in terror activities. However, China repeatedly blocks sanctions against its chief despite India repeatedly putting evidence in the public domain,' sources said. In the past, China has indirectly accused India of pursuing political interests in the name of countering terror, a charge India has denied.
