 The incident took place on the morning of July 16 at the Puruming Postpartum Care Centre in Yanji, north-east China. The nurse, in purple, is seen casually pushing the stroller back and forth and the stroller toppled over. The baby is seen sliding off the stroller and apparently hit the ground on its head. Another worker, in pink, rushed over to help the nurse pick up the baby. Then, the baby is seen being taken into an area by the nurse where two other babies are kept.The baby, a boy, was 19 days old when the incident occurred, according to Wang Xi, a solicitor representing the baby's family.          The baby apparently hit the floor on its head before the workers rushed to pick it up          The postpartum care centre said the nurse was an experienced medical professionalThe 14-second video became viral after being released to the Chinese social media yesterday by Beijing-based lawyer Yi Shenghua.In a post, Mr Yi accused the care centre of being irresponsible.Mr Yi, apparently angry, wrote: 'Had the CCTV footage not been released, how long would you hide this matter from the public?' The clip quickly gathered attention from people on social media, who left thousands of comments, accusing the worker of being 'careless' and 'brutal'.         The centre also described the matter as 'small negligence' and said the baby was unhurt         The nurse then carried the baby to an area where two other infants were kept in the care centreThe Puruming Postpartum Care Centre claims to provide a wide range of services in taking care of new mothers and newborn babies. On its website, the centre's services range from specialised care for babies to yoga training for mothers. A spokesperson from the care centre confirmed to media that the incident took place in July, but described the matter as 'small negligence' from the worker.The spokesperson told a reporter from Pear Video that the nurse had previously worked as a deputy director at a hospital for more than 30 years.She also said: 'The baby was unscathed. A CT scan at the People's Hospital showed no damage had been caused to the brain.'She added: 'After all, human beings are not gods. There would be times when accident happens.'Ms Wang, the family's solicitor, told MailOnline although the medical checks on the day showed no damage had occurred to the baby, the checks could not guarantee the baby's neurological health in the days to come. 'We can see from the video that the carer was extremely irresponsible,' said Ms Wang. MailOnline has contacted the Puruming Postpartum Care Centre for comments, and was informed by workers at the centres that they could not provide any opinions on the matter and they did not know where the manager was.
