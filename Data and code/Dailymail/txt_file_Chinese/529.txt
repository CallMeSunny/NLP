 In the video, shared by Pear Video, the boy said his name is Chen Junyu.His parents told a reporter that little Junyu is a big fan of diggers. He plays with his toy digger at home all day long.His father, an excavator operator in Hubei, said he hadn't intentionally taught his son how to operate the machine.He said: 'Whenever he was free, I'd put him on the back seat of the digger.'There was one time I showed him how to use the control and dashboard, and he just remembered.'         Chen's parents, from Hubei, China, said their son loves playing with his toy digger at home         However, police said it is illegal and dangerous for a child to operate such heavy machineryAlthough little Junyu knows the ins and outs on how to operate a digger, police said it's illegal for people under 18 years old to drive such a heavy-duty vehicle without a proper working licence.  'It's dangerous for children to operate the machinery because their arms might not be enough long to reach the handle bar and control panels,' said the police.Parents are suggested to look after their children in order to avoid accidents from happening.
