 One of the organisers Rela posted a video to social media site Weibo of the parents attending the market. At first they were welcomed by people interested in what they were doing. One of the mothers can be seen telling others that she 'wants her child to be happy and that's all a mother wants.' Her message appears to be welcomed by one onlooker who tells her that 'It's not a problem, that's understandable.'However things escalated with one man telling the parents that their children were 'abnormal'.          The parents were also there to raise awareness of LGBTQ issues         However after some time, the parents attracted some negative attention and questioning         They were later escorted off the premises by police who said they needed a permitThey were also asked about their children's sexual activities.  The police were called and told the parents that they did not have a permit to be there and so they had to leave the area immediately. People have spoken about the parents on Chinese social media. One user wrote: 'They have really touched by heart. Parents coming out in public to defend and help their children.' While another commented: 'This is very heart-melting to me. While the majority of the public sees these mothers as lunatics, they are doing something brave for their daughters. Choices of sexual orientation are personal and why can't we accept their choices.' And one user said: 'I hope people can treat gays and lesbians as normal. And I hope there is a day when my partner and I can hold hands in public.'   Homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness 15 years ago in China. However in Beijing, LGBTQ activists have been unable to organise a pride in the city due to pressure from officials. According to a study by the UN Development Program, only 5 percent of China's LGBT population is open about their sexual gender or identity at work.
