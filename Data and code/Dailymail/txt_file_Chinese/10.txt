A tense moment played out between Senator Penny Wong and Trade Minister Simon Birmingham during a televised debate in South Australia on Wednesday afternoon Ms Wong was clearly angered over the comments attacking Labor policy on China and accusing them of inconsistency over the issue. Mr Birmingham was referencing comments Mr Keating made earlier this week that Australian intelligence agency chiefs were 'nutters' and they should be replaced to improve relations with China. He said security organisations ASIO and ASIS were too heavily involved in shaping foreign policy.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Australian political parties woo Chinese-Australian voters    Australia's security agencies are run by 'NUTTERS' who have...

 'The nutters are in charge. They've lost their strategic bearings, these organisations.' Mr Keating told the ABC after Labor's launch on Sunday.Labor leaders, including  Bill Shorten, have distanced themselves from the comments saying they do not share the former PM's views.          As the event wrapped up, Ms Wong refused to shake Mr Birmingham's outstretched hand before reaching past him to shake the other panelist's hands 'Paul Keating is not an isolated figure (in the Labor party on this issue),' Mr Birmingham said during the debate. 'Speaking of not being partisan on the issue of China. This is really desperate politics. It's not in your national interest,' Ms Wong fires back. Users on social media were divided as to whether Ms Wong's actions were  justified. 'Good on you Penny Wong. Birmingham way out of line,' one commenter said. 'Birmingham just shot down bipartisanship on security. Also for a few seconds of personal glory,' another said. 'Thought Penny Wong was more gracious than that,' countered a third. On Tuesday Ms Wong slammed a political campaign run on Chinese app Wechat that was circulating fake news about Labor policies.          Ms Wong just on Tuesday slammed a political campaign run on Chinese app Wechat that was circulating fake news about Labor policies
