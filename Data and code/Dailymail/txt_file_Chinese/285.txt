Former NBA star Stephon Marbury and Jimmer Fredette, another former NBA lottery pick, got into a shoving match during a recent Chinese Basketball Association game.Fredette, who was the national college player of the year at BYU in 2011, was driving for a layup when he was struck by Marbury, a two-time NBA All-Star who has played in China since 2010.There was no foul called on the play, so Fredette took matters into his own hands by getting in Marbury's face and shoving the Brooklyn native.Marbury responded in kind and the two had to be separated as both benches emptied onto the floor. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO          After a hard foul, Stephon Marbury and Jimmer Fredette got into an altercation during a Chinese Basketball Association game.

This was the second consecutive game in which Fredette scored at least 50 points and he's currently averaging 40 a game.Marbury, 40, is a three-time CBA champion who has enjoyed a rebirth in China after his disastrous tenure with the Knicks.Fredette, who led the NCAA in scoring back in 2011, also had a short tenure with the Knicks. His NBA career only lasted 235 games despite the fact that he was a lottery pick for the Sacramento Kings in 2011.Marbury thrived in China since leaving the NBA after the 2009 season, winning three CBA titles, making six All-Star teams, and was even honored with a statue built in his likeness. And to many, his move to China seemed like a positive ending for a turbulent NBA career in which he averaged nearly 20 points a game but failed to lead any of his five teams deep into the playoffs.

Marbury was not accused of any wrongdoing and was never charged with a crime.Even before joining the Knicks, Marbury struggled in New York. Back in 2000, when he was still playing with the New Jersey Nets, the Georgia Tech product told the NYPD that he had a 24-inch diamond necklace worth $150,000 stolen from him at gunpoint in Manhattan.Marbury's father passed away in 2007, which only exacerbated matters for the point guard, and things didn't go any better when his discount sneaker line, 'Starbury,' was discontinued in 2009.Also in 2009, Marbury posted a bizarre video in which he ate Vaseline straight from the container in what he claimed was an attempt to beat a sore throat.'I wanted to die,' Marbury told HBO Sports about the end of his tenure in New York. 'I wanted to kill myself some days. I did. ... It wasn't about basketball. It started to become about me. Because I was that depressed and I was that sick.'Despite the bad press, Marbury is known for being charitable in New York, making seven-figure donations to the New York Police Department, New York Fire Department, and the New York City Teacher's Fund.Marbury had a contract with the Beijing Ducks that would have allowed the team to make him an assistant coach for the upcoming season, but that deal was ultimately terminated, leading Marbury to sign with the crosstown Fly Dragons before this season.
