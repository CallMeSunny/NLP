Government officials have drawn up plans to dramatically scale back the extent of nuclear cooperation with the Chinese government, it emerged last night.One proposal would see the Hinkley Point nuclear plant in Somerset given the go-ahead but reconsider a linked project which would see China build a separate nuclear reactor in Bradwell, Essex.However, yesterday it was reported Beijing is resisting attempts to unpick the multi-billion pound deal. The issue could overshadow Theresa May's visit to China next week for the G20 summit of major powers.Mrs May will travel to Hangzhou for the meeting on September 4 and 5 which will be hosted by the Chinese President Xi Jinping.         One proposal would see the Hinkley Point nuclear plant in Somerset (pictured) given the go-aheadLast month the Prime Minister 'called in' the Hinkley Point deal amid concerns about both cost and security because of the prominent role of the Chinese State.The initial agreement, which was drawn up by George Osborne last September would see China General Nuclear Corporation (CGNC) taking a one third stake in Hinkley C, and part-fund another plant at Sizewell in Suffolk. Both projects would be led by French energy giant EDF.In theory, however, the third project in Bradwell would be built by the Chinese firm, giving it a crucial foothold in Europe.At the weekend, the chief executive of EDF, Vincent de Rivaz, dismissed security concerns about Hinkley, saying he knows and trusts his 'Chinese partners'.

 He also argued the staff on the project would be 'rigorously vetted' and the UK' s nuclear regulator wouldn't have approved the project unless it was 'satisfied' security has been 'properly addressed'.But some Tory MPs have warned Britain should 'sup with a long spoon' with China because of its history of cyber-attacks on the UK.Concerns about China escalated earlier this month when it emerged CGNC is accused of planning to steal details of US nuclear technology developments. A senior member of staff, Allen Ho, 66, is alleged to have tapped up US experts to pass nuclear technology information to China.Ho faces trial in Georgia on charges of helping a foreign power produce nuclear material, and could receive a lengthy prison sentence if found guilty.         Theresa May will travel to Hangzhou for the meeting on September 4 and 5 which will be hosted by the Chinese President Xi Jinping (pictured) Writing in the Sunday Telegraph ,Mr de Rivaz said: 'We know and trust our Chinese partners. Beyond that, the UK independent nuclear regulator has only granted Hinkley Point a nuclear site licence after being satisfied that security has been properly addressed.'All staff on nuclear projects are rigorously vetted, wherever they come from. As is standard practice, the control systems at Hinkley Point C will be isolated from IT systems and the internet.'Critics of Hinkley argue that as well as the security matters, the £30bn cost of subsidies is too expensive and the guaranteed price of electricity offered to the firm is too high.
