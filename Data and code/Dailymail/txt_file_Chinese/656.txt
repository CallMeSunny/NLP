After almost a century of on-off production, the last MG-branded car has been built in the UK.Owners of MG Motor confirmed last week that the Longbridge plant in the West Midlands has ceased assembling cars which will now be fully built in China.According to reports, just 25 jobs will be lost at the site near Birmingham with the sales, marketing and after-sales departments located at the 300-employee strong UK base unaffected.         No longer built in Britain: MG Motor's Longbridge UK headquarters has now stopped putting the finishing touches to part-assembled cars arriving from ChinaFollowing the collapse of MG Rover in 2005, Chinese automaker Nanjing Automobile bought the MG marque and the Longbridge facility for £53 million the following year.Some 12 months on, Shanghai-based SAIC Motor acquired the Chinese car firm along with the British-badged carmaker that was first established in 1920.Since 2007, three MG Motor models have been launched and part-built in the UK.

MG Motor said the work carried out on vehicles in the West Midlands factory was minimal         The MG6 - the first new MG model in 16 years - was the first of the China-owned MG Motor cars to be part-built at the Longbridge site in 2011. The axed production line means Birmingham is no longer the 'home of MG manufacturing'         The factory was previous owned by MG Rover, which collapsed over a decade agoHe said: 'With efficiency and flexibility both key to long-term market success, off-shoring vehicle production is a necessary business decision.'Relocating to state-of-the-art overseas production facilities will allow faster access to product and help to meet ever-increasing customer demand, all while maintaining the highest levels of production quality.'In addition, improving production scale efficiencies will support ongoing sales growth in the UK market – a key priority.'The carmaker has sold 2,300 vehicles in the UK so far this year – up by 350 units compared to the same time in 2015.Much of the growth is down to the latest model in the range, the GS compact SUV, which has been heavily advertised in recent months.But last week's news means one of the nation's best recognised auto brands will no longer be built in Britain in any form.         Stopping the production line will see 25 employees made redundant, however more than 300 other staff working at the Longbridge headquarters for MG Motor UK are unaffectedLabour MP Mr Burden told the Birmingham newspaper: 'MG’s decision to close its assembly line at Longbridge is hugely disappointing and I believe it is premature.'I understand the business concerns that MG have surrounding costs of assembly at Longbridge, which have undoubtedly been aggravated by problems with the strength of the pound. 'However, more discussions should have taken place to explore alternatives and options before any decisions were finalised.'Having spoken to the Government, I know they are willing to meet MG to discuss and explore options and help that may be available and I am sure the same will be true for the local authority and the Local Enterprise Partnership. 'That is why I have appealed to MG to delay this decision pending such detailed meetings.'   SAVE MONEY ON MOTORING     Car insurance Compare policies       Warranties Get covered        Breakdown cover Find the best deals        Personal loans Borrow for a car        MOTs made easy Apply online
