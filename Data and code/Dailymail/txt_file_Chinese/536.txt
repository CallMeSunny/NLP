Stanford students have recreated an ancient 5000-year old Chinese beer brew.The ancient Chinese beer looked like porridge and tasted sweeter and fruitier than the clear, bitter beers of today. The students made more than one type of ancient brew, which they made using ancient brewing techniques from early human civilizations.  Scroll down for video         The students made more than one type of ancient brew, which they made using ancient brewing techniques from early human civilizations HOW TO MAKE THE 5,000 YEAR OLD BEER  Use either wheat, millet or barley seeds as your grain. Cover the chosen grain with water and let it sprout - a process called malting.After the grains have sprouted, crush the seeds and put them in water again. Place this container with the mixture in the oven and heat it to 65 degrees Celsius (149 F) for an hour - this process is called mashing. Seal the container with plastic and let it stand at room temperature for a week to ferment.   Professor Li Liu, a professor of Chinese archaeology at Stanford University, taught the class that brewed the beers.She said: 'We include two different kinds of beer making – one is by chewing, and the other one is by sprouting the cereals.'We want students to understand how things were made and really have their hand on. 'Archaeology is not just about reading books and analyzing artifacts.'The students brewed the ancient beers as part of a course called Archaeology of Food: Production, Consumption and Ritual.Professor Liu and other researchers discovered the ancient recipe by analyzing the residue on inner walls of pottery vessels found in a site in northeast China.The ancient Chinese made beer mainly with cereal grains, including millet and barley, as well as with Job’s tears, a type of grass in Asia, according to the research.

          Professor Li Liu (pictured), a professor of Chinese archaeology at Stanford University, taught the class that brewed the beers. Professor Liu and other researchers discovered the ancient recipe by analyzing residue on inner walls of pottery vessels found in a site in northeast China HOW TO MAKE MANIOC 'SPIT' BEER   This type of beer-making is indigenous to many cultures in South America where the brew is referred to as 'chicha'.Traditional chicha uses corn, but quinoa, potato, or manioc root (yuca) can be used.  Chew the  manioc in your mouth - the enzymes in your saliva will convert the starch in the manioc into fermentable sugar. Add the mixture to water and boil it.Add sugar cane to help with the fermentation process.Cover it with a cloth and leave it to sit for one to three days.   Traces of yam and lily root parts also appeared in the concoction.At the end of Professor Liu’s class, each student tried to imitate the ancient Chinese beer using either wheat, millet or barley seeds.The students first covered their grain with water and let it sprout, in a process called malting. After the grain sprouted, they crushed the seeds and put them in water again.The container with the mixture was then placed in the oven and heated to 65 degrees Celsius (149 F) for an hour, in a process called mashing.Afterward, the students sealed the container with plastic and let it stand at room temperature for about a week to ferment to become alcoholic. Alongside that experiment, the students tried to replicate making beer with a vegetable root called manioc. That type of beer-making, which is indigenous to many cultures in South America where the brew is referred to as 'chicha,' involves chewing and spitting manioc, then boiling and fermenting the mixture. Madeleine Ota, an undergraduate student at Stanford University who took the class, said: 'It was a strange process.'People looked at me weird when they saw the "spit beer" I was making for class. 'I remember thinking, "How could this possibly turn into something alcoholic?"'But it was really rewarding to see that both experiments actually yielded results.'She said that everybody had different results because they were all using different grains.Ota used red wheat to brew her ancient beer - which had a fruity smell and citrus taste similar to cider. But the manioc 'spit' beer smelled like bad cheese and Ota didn't want to taste test it.The result of the experiments will be used in further research on ancient alcohol-making that Professor Liu and her colleagues are working on.  Throughout history, the consumption of alcohol may have helped people become more creative, advancing the development of language, art and religion. This is because alcohol lowers inhibitions and makes people feel more spiritual.  All alcoholic drinks are made by yeasts - tiny single-celled life forms that consume sugar and break it down into carbon dioxide and ethanol. There are many different types of yeast, and they've probably been fermenting fruit for 120 million years - when fruits first arose on Earth. Many human enjoy drinking alcohol because it makes us feel good - it releases serotonin and dopamine in the brain which reduces anxiety and make us feel happy. But our primate ancestors who relied on a largely fruit based diets had other reasons to seek out alcohol. The alcohol smelled strong, which helped them find fruit more easily, We've adapted to consuming alcohol over many years, and there's evidence of that in different human civilizations in history.         The students first covered their grain with water and let it sprout, in a process called malting. For example, the origin of wine grapes can be traced back to the Caucus mountains in Georgia and the Zagros Mountains of Iran.Professor Liu isn't the only researcher re-creating ancient brews.  Dr Patrick McGovern, an 'alcohol archaeologist' at the University of Pennsylvania, has been tracing back some of the world’s most ancient brews.By analyzing the residues found on fragments of pottery and studying references in texts, he has managed to recreate a number of ancient beers and wines that were all but lost to history. The beverages were brewed by Dogfish Head Brewery in Delaware, who worked with Dr Patrick McGovern of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.         After the grain sprouted, they crushed the seeds and put them in water again. The container with the mixture was then placed in the oven and heated to 65 degrees Celsius (149 F) for an hour, in a process called mashingTo reveal what ingredients were needed, Dr McGovern analysed residues found at various archaeological sites around the world.He detected traces of various ingredients left by the drinks - including barley, honey, herbs and spices - using a number of methods including liquid chromatography, gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.The first drink that he recreated is named the Midas Touch, and is based on molecular evidence from residues found inside a Turkish tomb, believed to have belonged to King Midas, dating back to 700 BC.         The students also tried to replicate making beer with a vegetable root called manioc. That type of beer-making, which is indigenous to many cultures in South America where the brew is referred to as 'chicha,' involves chewing and spitting manioc, then boiling and fermenting the mixtureA variety of alcoholic residues have been found inside important tombs around the world - suggesting that they were drinks used during celebrations or rituals and perhaps even to wish good luck to the dead in the afterlife.The sweet and dry Midas Touch beer is made using honey, barley malt, white muscat grapes and saffron.The oldest beer that Dr McGovern brewed is entitled Chateau Jiahu, the ingredients for which were discovered inside a 9,000-year-old tomb in China. It is made using hawthorn fruit, Chinese wild grapes, rice and honey, and is the oldest known fermented beverage in history - older even than wine.
