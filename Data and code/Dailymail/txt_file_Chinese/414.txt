 After initial reports of the ban, animal rights groups said vendors and officials reached a compromise, setting a limit of two dogs displayed per stall. WHAT IS THE YULIN DOG MEAT FESTIVAL? Some claimed that the consumption of dog meat has been observed in Guangxi Province, China, for hundreds of years.However, the activity had not been promoted and encouraged until around 30 years ago - first by the dog meat traders, then by the Yulin government for driving tourism.The annual Yulin Dog Meat Festival can be traced back to 2009.  The event has drawn waves of criticism from media and animal lovers, with influential figures leading campaigns around the world in a bid to stop it.The local government has stopped organising the festival under pressure, as it is understood, but vendors continue selling dog meat and residents carry on eating it on the summer solstice.    But multiple carcasses rested on some stalls at the main Nanqiao market, with stiff pointy tails, leathery yellow skin, eyes shut and bared teeth as if in a final growl.Behind two long rows of dog butchers, other vendors sold more typical fare like cow tongues and pork hocks and trotters. But even they sold some dog parts, including liver.The market also features poultry, tanks of fish and vegetables and fruits, including big bundles of lychees.Lychee, a seasonal fruit, is often eaten during the festival. That's why the festival is also known as 'Yulin Lychee Dog Meat Festival'.However, there was said to be a heavy police presence outside the market and at all intersections. Outside the market, vendors sold stewed dog meat out of enormous steaming woks, shovelling big portions into plastic bags for passing customers.Some changed their 'dog meat' signs to read 'tasty meat' instead. One restaurant put yellow paper over the character for dog.Another restaurant's owner surnamed Yang said he sells rice noodle soup in the morning but lunch customers order dog.'Business during the festival goes up about ninefold. But don't worry, we always manage to have enough dogs,' he said, adding that he planned to sell six dogs a day during the festival.Dog meat sellers in Yulin have said previously that activists' protests have actually attracted greater attention and encouraged more people to eat the meat.                 Multiple carcasses rested on a stall at the main Nanqiao market on June 21 as the Yulin Dog Meat Festival begins. The locals eat dog meat to celebrate the summer solstice         The market also features poultry, vegetables and fruits, including big bundles of lychees         Some claimed that the consumption of dog meat has been observed in Guangxi Province, China, for hundreds of years, but the activity became more popular in the recent decades         Dog meat sellers in Yulin have said previously that activists' protests have actually attracted greater attention and encouraged more people to eat the meat          An insider told MailOnline that all restaurants are packed today and dog markets are busy'Despite the fact that there does not seem to be a ban on all dog meat, the festival appears to be smaller this year, with fewer dogs losing their lives to this cruel industry,' Irene Feng of Animals Asia told AFP.  WHY CAN'T THE EVENT BE STOPPED?  Various measures have been taken by the Yulin government to discourage canine banquets from happening on summer solstice.According to Dr Peter J. Li, an expert on the topic, the Yulin authority issued an internal order in May, 2013, prohibiting any traders or butchers from slaughtering dogs in the street. In May 2014, an internal written notice was distributed in Yulin, which banned government officials from eating dogs around the summer solstice.Dr. Li said that it would be hard for the government to ban the trade once and for all as it is the livelihood for the vendors who are less educated and largely unskilled former peasants.Dr Li also said that if the government did terminate the festival by force, it would have to provide means of livelihood for those affected.What the Yulin government tries to do now is waiting for the industry to die out on its own.  However, a Chinese animal lover, who calls herself Kimi, told MailOnline that this year's Yulin Dog Meat Festival was as busy as usual.'All the restaurants were packed. In some big markets, dog meat is still being sold in broad day light,' she said.Kimi said a group of animal lovers saved 1,200 dogs in Guangzhou on June 19. Crammed into rusty cages, the animals were said to be transported from Gansu in north-west China to Yulin in southern China as supply to the Yulin Dog Meat Festival.After the animal lovers informed the local authority, it took the officials more than 24 hours to arrive at the scene and helped rescue the dogs, according to Kimi. In May, the Yulin government was said to have informed the local vendors to stop selling dog meat in the lead-up to the summer solstice, which falls on June 21 this year. The news was widely reported by media around the world.Multiple sources confirmed to MailOnline that the ban had been given to the vendors in downtown Yulin orally by the city's officials.Apparently, the ban is set to prohibit the sale of dog meat in central Yulin between June 15 and 23, especially in major shops and markets, such as the Dongkou Market. However, a spokesman from the Yulin Propaganda Department told The Beijing News on June 15 that the government had never issued a ban on the sale of dog meat. According to the report, the department insisted that the festival was organised by local residents themselves and was customary. The department claimed they had never heard of the alleged ban and did not know how overseas media had obtained their information.         In May, the Yulin government was said to have informed the local vendors to stop selling dog meat in the lead-up to the summer solstice, which falls on June 21 this year         However, a spokesman told media later that the government had never issued such a ban         A man sits behind his pet dogs near a restaurant which serves dog meat in Yulin on June 21. Animal lovers said many of the dogs served during the festival were stolen pets         A vendor uses the boards to chop dog meat at the Nanqiao market in Yulin on June 21It's been estimated that 10 million dogs are slaughtered for meat in China annually. Many of them are believed to be stolen pets.The animal is eaten in some other Asian countries, such as Vietnam and South Korea.The summer solstice is the day to mark the end of the dog meat season in Yulin, according to Dr Peter J. Li, the Associate Professor of East Asian Politics at the University of Houston-Downtown and the China Policy Specialist from Humane Society International.While commenting on the alleged ban, Dr Li said it was unlikely to stop the dog meat banquets in private homes or at private events on summer solstice.He explained that Yulin, a city in the largely agricultural Guangxi Province, is spread out and composed of a large rural area, and it would be hard to restrict what the locals eat.          Yulin, in southern China's Guangxi Province, is spread out and composed of a large rural area         The restaurant was filled with eager diners on June 21 last year as Yulin celebrated the event         The picture (above) of Yulin No.1 Crispy Dog Meat Restaurant was taken on May 17 this year.
