Pyongyang denies the allegation.The assassination, which happened just as Kim was about to board a flight to Macau from the airport's budget terminal, sent tensions soaring between Pyongyang and Kuala Lumpur.Both countries expelled each other's ambassadors and barred their citizens from leaving. Tensions eased when Malaysia agreed to return Kim's body.Police are still trying to trace four North Koreans suspected of having taken part in the murder plot but who are believed to have returned to their capital immediately after the killing.The murder in Kuala Lumpur removed a potential claimant to the leadership of the reclusive nation - Kim Jong-Nam was late leader Kim Jong-Il's first born - who was an embarrassment to Pyongyang, which has caused global alarm with its atomic weapons program.
