 Chinese authorities have come up with their own tracking system named Beidou which must be installed in vehicles by June 30. The system will cost vehicle owners 90 yuan a year (£10.50) and those who do not have the system installed will not be served at petrol stations. A police staff member told the Global Times: 'All vehicles must install the system so that they can be tracked wherever they go. It also helps car owners to find their cars quickly if it's been stolen or taken.'   XINJIANG FIGURES  Muslims in China make up 1.8 percent of the country's population. Xinjiang province is home to 10.37 million Uygurs. The province has some 24,400 Muslim mosques   Source: Statistic Bureau of Xinjiang Bayingol Public Security Bureau released a statement on its social media account saying: 'Cars are the major means of transportation for terrorists and also a frequently chosen tool to conduct terrorist attacks. 'So it's necessary to use the Beidou system and electronic vehicle identification to enhance the management of vehicles.'        Uighur men gather for morning prayers at the Id Kah Mosque during Corban (File photo)          Motorists in Bayingol are being made to install a tracking device in their vehiclesIn recent years there have been crackdowns by the Chinese government in the region in a bid to curb terrorism which it blames on Islamist militants. On February 21, the Hotan prefecture in Xinjiang announced that it would be offering a reward of up to 5 million yuan (£583,000) to people who report terrorist activities.  Xinjiang is home to 10.37 million Uygurs who practice the Muslim faith.
