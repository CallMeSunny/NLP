They were taken to former Japanese military installations and forced to provide sexual services to officers and soldiers during World War Two. It is thought that up to 200,000 women were sexually enslaved.Why is the issue important? The row has long caused a stalemate in relations between Japan and its neighbouring countries, particularly South Korea and China. The disagreement has also involved the U.S., which is seeking to strengthen security cooperation between Tokyo and Seoul, Washington's key Asian security allies. Why are feelings about it so strong after all these years?  The majority of Japanese feel they have atoned enough for the country's wartime aggression and other wrongdoing, including the 'comfort women' issue, after numerous apologies and statements. But many South Koreans and Chinese insist that the sincerity of the official apologies remained doubtful due to some of the country's leaders actions, such as paying homage at the Yasukuni war shrine in Tokyo.How has a deal finally been struck now? Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korea President Park Geun-Hye called for a resolution of the issue at a summit last month in Seoul.There have since been a series of meetings between senior diplomats of the two countries, culminating in the meeting between their foreign ministers today in Seoul. Does this finally close the issue? Japan is optimistic, and Ms Park said they must 'turn this agreement into a priceless opportunity to help restore the honour and dignity of the victims and heal their wounds'.  Kan Kimura, an expert on Japan-South Korea relations at Kobe University, however, said success is not certain.He said: 'This is an agreement between the two governments, but not between the two societies. So the next focus is whether the South Korean government can persuade its public to accept the deal.'
