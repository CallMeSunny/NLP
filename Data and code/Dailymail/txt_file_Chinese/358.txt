China's unrelenting effort to prove that Indian state Arunachal Pradesh is a part of Tibet has been going on for years and is major strand of its foreign policy.In its latest efforts, the Chinese government has employed a two-pronged approach: psychological (spreading rumours to intimidate the enemy and break down will); and cultural (assimilating different cultural trends) and media warfare (manipulating what people see and hear).Mail Today has accessed magazines and websites funded by China to further its claims over Arunachal Pradesh being an 'integral' part of Tibet (i.e. China).         A Chinese magazine describes Lhoba Apatanis as the most beautiful of all Tibetan tribesEven as the border crisis in Doklam continues, an article published last month in 'China Travel Guide' magazine ferociously promotes tourism in 'southern Tibet' and 'Ziro' as a tourist destination.Interestingly, Ziro lies very much within Arunachal Pradesh.To further Beijing's argument, the magazine describes the composition and demography of the place and speaks at length of the inhabitants, the Lhoba Apatanis, a 'Chinese' tribeWriter and columnist Claude Arpi has argued as to why the Indian government is not countering the Chinese move by 'documenting the rich culture of Arunachal (and Northeast in general) and invite Indian and foreign visitors to come and see for themselves the beauty of the people, their culture, their villages and their wiser sustainable way of life'.He also translated some parts of the article in 'China Travel Guide' which, according to him, explains Apatanis as 'the most beautiful ethnic people' of China.The article says, 'In the Tibetan area of southern Tibet, there is a tribe named Apatani. The women of this tribe are known to be the most beautiful of all Tibetan tribes.          RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       China's threat to teach India a 'bigger lesson' than it did...

In order to protect themselves from other tribal intruders' attack, they make themselves less attractive, by plugging a big cork into the nose... but for the Apatanis in southern Tibet, this is considered as a protection to live a longer life.'But Gen (Retd.) J.J. Singh, former army chief, who served in Arunachal, rubbished the claims. He said, 'No Arunachali tribe has any links with Tibetans except bartering of forest produce in exchange for salt.'Apatanis were not even Buddhist and were Animalistic. This is a story being cooked up by the China because they are calling Arunachal as South Tibet, a term that was never part of our lexicon even 50 years ago.'The videos the Chinese have put out celebrate Lhobas and try to take ownership of their origins as well as their place of habitation.         China's unrelenting effort to prove that Indian state Arunachal Pradesh is a part of Tibet has been going on for years and is major strand of its foreign policyJabin Jacob, Fellow at the Institute of Chinese Studies, puts things in perspective. He says, 'This has been going on for a while as one would expect.'Along with Chinese patrols along LAC, they also leave behind stuff - cigarette butts, noodle wraps - as litter on our side showing presence and claim. These methods help China build an international case for its claims.''India should do the same with PoK. On Arunachal, we need to increase international attention by opening up more to tourism through better infrastructure. That would set India apart from Chinese methods in Tibet that are culturally problematic and environmentally ruinous,' heÂ added.
