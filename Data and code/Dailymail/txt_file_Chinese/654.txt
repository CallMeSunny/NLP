 However, Liang's counsel argued that she had thought she was signing a conditional agreement, but it was instead an unconditional agreement. The property owners, Hongwei Zhao and Zhidong Huang, cancelled the sale agreement and sued Golden Garden Ltd for the $730,000 deposit.Evidence presented in an earlier judgement said the real reason Liang tried to cancel the deal was because she didn't have investors' support and they had not given their approval to purchase.          It was ruled at Auckland High Court (pictured) ruled that Mrs Liang's company did not have an arguable defence, and had to pay the $730,000 deposit (stock image)'She is clearly a businesswoman familiar with dealings in real estate.
