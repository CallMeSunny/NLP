         A defiant Liam Fox (file image) has called on Remain supporters to use the new year to end 'self-defeating pessimism' over BrexitA defiant Liam Fox has called on Remain supporters to use the new year to end 'self-defeating pessimism' over Brexit.  As he flies to China on a trade mission, the International Trade Secretary said Brexit was not a 'time bob to be defused' but was in fact a 'great opportunity'.Mr Fox said the hallmark of 2017 for him had been positive visits around the world to launch trade talks only to return home to a 'wave of negativism' from 'people who would rather see Britain fail'. The Trade Secretary is on a two-stage visit to Beijing and Shenzen this week, promoting British trade and attempting to increase economic cooperation.He will meet  Chinese Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan and the chairman of one of the world's largest insurance companies, Ma Mingzhe from Ping An. Ahead of his trip, in an article for the Tory party activist website ConservativeHome, Mr Fox revealed his frustration at negativity over Brexit at home.He said: 'The interest being shown in Britain overseas, and an increasing willingness to trade and invest with us, was in stark contrast to the self-defeating pessimism that is too often on show from certain politicians, commentators and media outlets over here.'It is easy to get the impression that these people would rather see Britain fail than see Brexit succeed.'    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Transport Secretary hints train fares could rise by less in...

 The Trade Secretary added: 'Attitudes need to change as we go into 2018; Brexit is not a time bomb to be defused, but a great opportunity to be embraced.'Our international competitors are already out there trying to carve out their slice of the world's growing markets.'We need to get beyond the obsession with criticising Brexit, lift our horizons, and be out there, too.'          Liam Fox's visit to China comes less than a month after Chancellor Philip Hammond made his own visit to Beijing (pictured with Premier Li Keqiang last month)          Theresa May has been eager to continue relations and is widely expected to make a long-awaited visit to Beijing herself later this year (she is pictured arriving in China for a G20 summit in September)          David Cameron invited President Xi Jinping for a state visit in 2015, personally entertaining him near the PM's country estate at Chequers (pictured) Mr Fox defied criticism that he had not yet signed any trade deals on behalf of Britain and accused his opponents of wilfully misunderstanding EU rules that stop him from doing so before Brexit happens.  His visit to China comes less than a month after Chancellor Philip Hammond made his own visit to the country.The UK Government has made massive efforts to court the Chinese, both before and after Brexit. David Cameron invited President Xi Jinping for a state visit in 2015 while George Osborne hailed a 'golden era' of relations.Theresa May has been eager to continue relations and is widely expected to make a long-awaited visit to Beijing herself later this year. China is the UK's fifth largest trading partner in the world, with trade between the countries worth £59.3 billion in 2016 based on the latest figures.In the same period the UK exported £16.8 billion of goods and services, making China the UK's eighth largest export market.  Joining Trans-Pacific Partnership trade group on the table, minister says  Britain could join a Pacific trade group after the UK leaves the European Union, according to reports.The Government has held informal talks on becoming a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) to stimulate exports following Brexit, the Financial Times claimed.Britain would be the first member of the trade agreement to not border the Pacific Ocean or the South China Sea.Liam Fox's Department for International Trade is said to be developing the proposals to join the group which lost its largest member - the United States - when President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement last year.The 11 remaining member states include Australia, Mexico, Singapore and Canada.Trade Minister Greg Hands told the Financial Times there was no geographical restriction on Britain joining trade groups.'Nothing is excluded in all of this,' he said.'With these kind of plurilateral relationships, there doesn't have to be any geographical restriction.'An International Trade spokeswoman said: 'We have set up 14 trade 'working groups' across 21 countries to explore the best ways of progressing our trade and investment relationships across the world.'It is early days, but as our Trade Policy Minister has pointed out, we are not excluding future talks on plurilateral relationships'.
