A Chinese man who swallowed a bottle cap by mistake has been saved by a five-minute operation after doctors used a condom to help removed the object.The 40-year-old, from Lianyungang city, said he gobbled down the metal cap on January 6 because he was drinking too fast during a reunion with friends, according to People's Daily Online. Doctors said they decided to use a condom because it was thin enough to go into the patient's body and could help prevent his esophagus and intestines from being damaged by the sharp edges of the cap.                 Dr. Ju, took out the sharp-teethed bottle cap by placing a condom down to Liu's stomach         With the help of endoscopy camera, Dr. Ju managed to place the cap inside the condom    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Chinese animal circus staff brutally tie up an endangered...

The latex condom can act as a protective gear to Liu's intestines and esophagus         The 60-year-old head of Gastroenterology was once a highly skilled electrical engineerHe also said a traditional open surgery on the stomach would cause more damage to the patient and could lead to internal bleeding.To reduce such damage, Dr. Ju came up with an idea of using a condom. A team of medical staff first sent the condom down to the man's stomach using the probe on top of the endoscopy and gently placed the bottle cap into the latex condom.They shook the cap a little to make sure it was inside the condom before pulling it out carefully.'It is just like how we use carrier bags normally,' he said.Surprisingly, it only took less than five minutes for Dr. Ju to remove the bottle cap from Liu's body.Such operation has proved rare in the medical field in China.According to Yangzi Evening News, Ju Weiping came from a less conventional background for a doctor, leading him to come up with the innovation method. The 60-year-old was said to work as a leading electrical engineer before starting to study Medicine at Xuzhou Medical College in 1978.
