 The song, which was uploaded to social media site Weibo, aims to show that the media portrayal of China is completely different to reality. The song opens with: 'First things first, we all know China is a developing country, it has a large population and it is really hard to manage'. The video shows images of crowded areas and Beijing's infamous smog. When talking about accidents, the rap group tells viewers: 'We made progress and we're trying to prevent these from happening.' It also covers gun control saying: 'We have tight gun control laws and we don't fear gun slaughtering.' Wang Zixin, who is a member of Chengdu Revolution and the producer of the song, said he and his friends just wanted to express what they thought their country is like.Wang, who also refers to himself as Chuckie, told MailOnline: 'When we formed the group in last October, what we hoped was to use an art form popular with young people to guide them to live a healthy life.'          Celebrations have been held across China to celebrate the founding of the Communist Party of China         People gather in the Great Hall of the People celebrating the 95th anniversary of the Communist Party of ChinaThe 23-year-old said the lyrics were written by a band member called Li Yijie, or Pissy, who majored in English. The four-minute song was sung by Li and another band member Luo Jinhui, or Roy. The group wrote on its official account on Weibo: 'Our friends from the West, if you still use foreign media such as CNN, AP and Reuters to get to know China, then the China you know surely isn't the real China.'However it does accept that in some areas China still has a long way to go. Wang said: 'We didn't just write about the good things, we also criticised some of China's current situation, such as the pollution and the poisonous milk powder.'I'd say a third of the song is positive and two-thirds are negative.' Interestingly, Wang was unhappy about the coverage from the 'Western media' on his song. He insisted that the band had not been hired by the Communist party to write the song. Wang said: 'I'm not even a member of the Communist party. The song is not arranged by the Communist Party.'China's Communist Youth League released the music video on Weibo three days before the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China on July 1.           A large flag of the Communist Party of China is displayed on a building in Shenyang         Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks during a celebration ceremony at the Great Hall of the People
