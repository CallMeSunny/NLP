   The decision to bring him in by Espanyol's Chinese billionaire owner, Chen Yansheng, appears to have been a masterstroke.Last season, the forward became one of the biggest stars in the Chinese Super League after he netted 27 goals in 29 games for Shanghai SIPG. It seems unlikely that Wu Lei will have the same impact in a much more demanding league but his sheer presence is just what Yansheng will have wanted.
