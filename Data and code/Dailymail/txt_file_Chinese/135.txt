China has taken a historic step in its bid to build a navy that rivals the world's finest by sending the country's first domestically built aircraft out for sea trials.The vessel has the temporary name Type 001A and set out yesterday from Dalian after President Xi Jinping announced a 'world-class' navy under the Chinese Communist Party's regime.The 50,000-tonne carrier is the first to be wholly built and designed in China, and is set to become the navy's second aircraft carrier by 2020.         The ship (pictured) set out for its sea trials today as part of the Chinese government's push to develop a world-class Navy. The 50,000-tonne aircraft carrier is the first to be built and designed entirely in China and is set to become the Navy's seccond carrier by 2020         The runway on the new vessel models the skip slope design of its predecessor. Though China still lags behind the United States in terms of military might, the Communist government is increasing the country's dominance in Asia, where only Japan seriously rivals it         The vessel - temporarily named Type 001A - was sent out for sea trials at 7am today as President Xi Jinping pushes ahead with modernisation in the country's Navy. Experts say that it still won't be enough to seriously challenge the dominance of the USA within the next 12 years       Currently the country only has a retrofitted Soviet-era aircraft carrier called the Liaoning, which was launched in 2012. But CNN reports the new vessel still won't be enough to rival the United States, but will boost the navy's standing in Asia.  Sam Roggeveen, senior fellow at Sydney's Lowy Institute, said: 'This is, in and of itself, not designed to be some frontal challenge to US power in the Asia Pacific, because it simply isn't in the class of America's aircraft carriers.'         China only has one aircraft carrier (pictured, the ship at its 2007 launch), which is called the Liaoning. It is a retrofitted Soviet-era vessel, showing the marked difference between the communist country's capabilities as compared with that of the US          The new aircraft carrier weighs 50,000 tonnes and analysis of recent satellite images suggest that modifications have been made for the ship to transport an additional eight aircraft. Unlike the nuclear-powered carriers the United States fields, the Chinese rely on less innovative means of propulsion More than 1,000 feet in length and 246 feet wide, the new ship uses conventional propulsion as opposed to nuclear and recent analysis of satellite images suggests modifications have been made to hold up to eight additional aircraft.Its predecessor was intended more as a training base, but the new ship is likely to be deployed for combat, putting China alongside the US, the UK, Russia and France in its global capability.     RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Trump's armada: Huge task force of 12 warships sets sail for...

 But it is still the US that fields more aircraft carriers than any other country. As of this year it fields 11 nuclear-powered carriers with 'catapult' technology, in which pistons or electromagnetic rails speed aircraft up as they leave the runway. This gives them an advantage over the Chinese planes, which rely on their own power and the ski-jump designs on both carriers.         China has sent its first home-built aircraft carrier for sea trials as the Communist government attempts to assert its military might on the world stage. Unable to use electromagnetic rails to speed aircraft up as they leave the runway, the ship instead relies on a ski-jump design         The ship is China's latest attempt to assert its military might and follows a surge of investment from 2010 to 2017, when the Navy's ship complement increased from 210 to 320. The country is fast developing capabilities to maintain presence in distant waters  Once this latest addition passes sea trials, it will need to be further vetted before it is deemed combat-ready. And plenty can still go wrong during the current trial, as the UK's HMS Queen Elizabeth proved last year when a leak left it in need of repair.And the US Navy's newest warship - the USS Gerald R Ford - has been blighted by glitches despite it being the world's most expensive at $13 billion. The 100,000-tonne vessel's catapult launcher, the equipment for catching planes upon landing and its radar were all found to be faulty.  Although China is far from catching up with the US, its military budget this year rose by eight per cent as the military pushes for modernisation. The Navy's ship complement increased from 210 to 320 between 2010 and 2017, with 2016 alone seeing an increase of 18.  American sea power is expected to continue dominating over the next 10 years, but China is fast developing capabilities to maintain presence in distant waters.  Last week US intelligence suggested there is a high probability that the Chinese fired missiles to three artificial islands in military drills.
