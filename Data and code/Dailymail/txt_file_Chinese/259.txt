A school in China which claims it could train women to be 'virtuous ladies' has sparked an outcry with its controversial ideology.In the so-called 'woman's morality class' in Fushun, which appeared to be popular, female students are taught that they should be submissive, house bound and living without any personal pursuits but their husband's and family's.Women who have in the past watched porn, skipped housework and had more than one boyfriend would be condemned by the school which was founded by a man, as video reports on Chinese media show.                A video on Chinese media shows a woman being told to kneel by a teacher (second to the left). The student said 'father, mother, I am wrong' to the camera before kowtowing    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       The world's 'longest-lasting rainbow': Stunning spectrum of...

 In addition, the teachers also scold women who use heavy make-up, have career ambitions and have the desire to divorce because 'they should live at the bottom of the society'.The school in question, the Fushun Traditional Culture and Education School, is a government certified institute which opened in 2011.In one video, a young woman was punished for watching porn. She was told to kneel on a stage and bowing to the camera.The guilt-ridden student apologised to her parents before kowtowing: 'Father, mother, I am wrong.'         It's claimed that the woman was being punished for watching pornographic videos         The teacher then asked her 'will you watch pornographic videos again', the student said 'no'When a teacher asked her in a soft tone 'will you watch pornographic videos again', the student replied in tears 'no'. The teacher, who was wearing a traditional Chinese top and skirt, then said: 'Let's delete all of them when you go home, okay?' The student agreed.It is understood that the incident took place in the school. It was filmed and then played to other students in class.  Another audio clip shows a teacher condemning women who order takeaways to avoid washing up dishes as it is a sign of the 'loss of female morality'.In a third class, a male teacher can be heard telling women they shouldn't sleep with more than one man. The man claimed that sperm from three different men could be extremely poisonous once its mixed and it was the punishment for unfaithful women.         Another student is seen kneeling in front of a portrait of Confucius for wearing makeup         The school in Fushun, China, also offers classes to teenage boys. In a video by Pear, a teacher is seen telling a boy masturbation would shorten his life and making him disabledIn addition, women were also taught to live like 'hens' because the life goal of a hen is to lay and hatch eggs. 'How can we be less sophisticated than hens?' A teacher queried. According to a series of investigation reports from Pear Video, the students are required to get up at 4:30am every day before doing eight hours labour work.It's claimed that some students were sent to the school by their husbands in order to 'restore their female consciousness' while others received recommendation from their friends. One former student, who is known by a pseudonym Jing Zi, said she was sent to the school by her mother. Jing Zi described the school to be 'disgusting' and said 'it should be closed as soon as possible'. She said when she was studying there, she was forced to wash toilets without gloves as a way to redeem her sins.         It's claimed that students were forced to clean squat toilets without gloves as a way to redeem her sins the Fushun Traditional Culture and Education School in Liaoning Province         Two students are seen wiping the floor of a room during a day of 'study'. Teachers at the school say women shouldn't improve themselves and should live at the bottom of the societyJing Zi claimed that the school doesn't charge tuition fees, and many students were grateful to the education they received there. After they graduate, they would donate their income from work to the school. After the video reports became viral, the school was heavily criticised by the Chinese public. New Weekly, a magazine from pioneering Guangdong in southern China, condemned the school in a column, saying it's reversing the effort the Chinese women have spent in the past century to fight for their equality. Beijing News, a daily newspaper in the Chinese capital city, commented that the popularity of the school is an insult to China's modern ethos on gender equality.         The controversial school is said to be founded by a man named Kang Jinsheng (pictured)The article provided a possible explanation: 'Why would women willingly go to receive the self-demoting propaganda?'Perhaps they have been repressed at home and the "female morality class" helped them justify the repress they had to endure and make their abnormal life appear normal.' The education authority of Fushun is yet to respond to the matters.
