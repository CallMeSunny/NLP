 Last year, for example, Qantas was pressured into changing the way it described Taiwan from a 'country' to a 'territory' on its website. Sources told Stuff that Air New Zealand officials were supposed to do the same in their flight paperwork - but someone forgot and this is why the plane was denied landing permission.      Why does China not recognise Taiwan? In 1949 the Chinese communists won a civil war against the nationalist government.The nationalists fled to Taiwan - but still claimed they were the legitimate government of China.The territory calls itself the Republic of China and does not recognise the communist government called the People's Republic of China.China claims Taiwan is a rogue province and is part of the country. It refuses to have diplomatic ties with governments that recognise Taiwan. The Taiwanese government has been careful to avoid any official declaration of independence as this may spark a war with the mainland.All major powers, including the US, Britain and Australia, do not recognise Taiwan as a separate country.Eighteen governments do, including Paraguay and the Vatican City. Air New Zealand said in a statement: 'This issue relates to a particular aircraft (a Boeing 787-9 with the registration NZQ) which is not yet certified to operate to China but was unfortunately assigned to operate our Shanghai flight on Saturday night. 'This new aircraft entered our fleet at the end of last year and it's standard requirement for a new aircraft to be registered with the relevant authorities in territories it will operate to.'Yesterday Air New Zealand was advised that the original application to have this aircraft registered to operate to China had expired and a fresh application was submitted. As is required, the application includes a list of destinations the airline operates to, including Taipei.We're very grateful for the Chinese regulator's assistance in resolving this matter.'The airline apologised to passengers and said a special service would fly them to Shanghai at 11pm on Sunday.'We know customers will be deeply disappointed and frustrated by this situation and we are very sorry for the disruption to their travel plans,' a statement read. Dozens of passengers fumed on social media about the 'serious administrative cock-up'. One posted a picture on Twitter of the onboard flight map showing the aircraft turning around.'I've just experienced a new level of China Bad: midway through our flight from Auckland to Shanghai, the pilot informs us that Chinese authorities had not given this plane permission to land, so we needed to turn around. 'A permitting issue, supposedly,' the passenger commented.The same flight, NZ289, was turned back on a flight to China on August 24 last year, although an airline spokeswoman said that was due to an engineering issue, not a permitting one.         The flight was reportedly denied permission to land in China because the airline's paperwork referenced Taiwan as an independent country.
