 Ms Chen saw the man preparing hot water and a knife-like tool after the dog was dead.The factory owner told Pear Video that they had been keeping the dog for four months.'It's to guard the factory and to entertain us. But we are about to close the factory for Chinese New Year, so it's better to kill it,' said the owner.He added that he had 'no choice' as no one would be able to keep it or feed it and he could not take it to home.       The dog died of suffocation and was later skinned before being boiling, according to Ms Chen         Factory owner said no one would be able to look after the dog over holidays, so it had to diePeter Li, China Policy Specialist for Humane Society International, condemned the man's behaviour and called the incident 'heart-breaking'.Mr Li told MailOnline that factory dogs in China are often left behind during Chinese New Year as workers travel back home for celebrations.'This faithful dog had served people by guarding the factory, only to be utterly betrayed by being hanged and eaten.  'There are no laws to protect animals in China, and until that changes I fear we will continue to see public displays of brutality that so damages China's global reputation,' Mr Li said.
