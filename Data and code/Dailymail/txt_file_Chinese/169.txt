The White House admitted Wednesday that the stock market's recent roller-coaster ride, widely attributed to President Trump's budding China trade war, could give investors 'short-term pain' before Wall Street rebounds.'The president is worried that we have countries that have been taking advantage of us for decades and that he's not going to allow that to happen anymore,' Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters.'We may have a little bit of short-term pain but we're certainly going to have long-term success.'  Beijing shoved back hard Wednesday after the administration published a 43-page collection of Chinese goods it planned to hit with new tariffs, retaliating with a list of similar duties on U.S. imports including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals.Beijing took less than 11 hours to respond, a speed that led to a steep selloff in global markets.But by the end of the trading day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had turned a 510-point drop – combining overnight losses and the day's trading low point – into a nearly 231-point gain on the day.But this year the markets have appeared to be playing dice with house money, swinging more than 3,000 points from high to low – representing more than 11 per cent of the Dow's valuation.        White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that investors could be in for 'short-term pain' as panic continues over tariff-related uncertainty, but insisted the long-term outlook would be healthy         The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up nearly 231 points after dropping nearly 380 points overnight, following China's threatened tariff retaliation               Trouble ahead? Chinese President Xi Jinping (right) matched President Donald Trump's import tariffs blow-for-blow with a new list of targeted products Wednesday morning           Stock futures tumbled overnight suggesting a rough day ahead on Wall Street, but traders pushed the Dow up by day's endPresident Donald Trump insisted Wednesday morning that the world's two most vibrant economies aren't trading potentially lethal financial blows in what could become a protracted trade war.'We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S.,' he tweeted in the morning.'Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!'He added two hours later in another tweet: 'When you’re already $500 Billion DOWN, you can’t lose!'Trump claimed in March that 'trade wars are good, and easy to win.' Neither the U.S. nor the Chinese tariffs have actually gone into effect, leaving open the possibility that the Trump administration is trying to establish a bargaining position for a future negotiation.          The year's trading has seen the Dow swing across a 3,000-point range, playing with more than 11 per cent of the index's valuation           All three major stock indexes were in the red Wednesday morning despite Trump's assurances that there was no trade war going on – yet           The Dow was headed south in early trading following news of China's tit-for-tat tariffs on American goodsSanders told reporters that the government is in a 'review process right now.' 'But certainly we expect China to make changes and stop the unfair trade practices that they've participated in for decades,' she said.'I would anticipate,' Sanders added, 'that if there are no changes to the behavior of China and they don't stop the unfair trade practices, then we would move forward' with tariffs. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Wednesday morning on CNBC that months of economic diplomacy were still ahead.  'Think about it: Even shooting wars end with negotiations,' he said.'The president is a life-long deal maker. This isn't the first deal he's gone into. It isn't the first controversy he's gone into, and I doubt that it will be the last one.'            'We are not in a trade war,' Trump insisted on Twitter, denying what the markets see as an unmistakable tit-for-tat future of economic sabotage           Trump tried to jump-start the markets 10 minutes before they opened, saying that America 'can't lose' because it's already so far behindNewly minted White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow told a Fox Business Network audience that the tariff announcements were 'just the first proposals.''We're putting it out for comment. It's going to take a couple months. I doubt if there would be any concrete actions for several months. We'll see how that plays out. Nothing concrete has actually happened,' he said.Like Trump, Kudlow insisted that 'there's no trade war here.''What you've got is the early stages of a process that will include tariffs, comments on the tariffs, then ultimate decision for negotiations. There's already back-channel talks going on,' he said.           Newly minted White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow told a Fox Business Network audience that the tariff announcements were 'just the first proposals' in a long process           'Think about it: Even shooting wars end with negotiations,' Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Wednesday, hinting that negotiations are more likely than economic sabotage   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       What ELSE did Rosenstein authorize Mueller to probe?

          The U.S. already plans to impose tariffs on a range of Chinese imports, including electronics           China shoved back with its own $50 billion tariff list on goods including soybeans, aircraft and cars           China slapped tariffs on U.S. products including porkBut stock markets appeared spooked just the same, at least early on.Automakers' stock futures were down sharply before trading opened, with Ford down 2.7 per cent and General Motors off 3.8 per cent. Ross said he was 'a little surprised that Wall Street was so surprised' by the Chinese response. 'This has been telegraphed for days and weeks.''I don't think anybody expected that China would do nothing in response to our initiative,' he said. U.S.-made goods that appear to face added tariffs in China would include Tesla electric cars, Ford's Lincoln auto models, Gulfstream jets made by General Dynamics and Brown-Forman Corp's Jack Daniel's whiskey.Unlike Washington's list, which was filled with many obscure industrial items, China's list strikes at signature U.S. exports, including soybeans, frozen beef, cotton and other key agricultural commodities produced in states from Iowa to Texas that voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.The U.S. targeted products that benefit from Chinese industrial policy, including its 'Made in China 2025' initiative to replace advanced technology imports with domestic products in strategic industries such as advanced IT and robotics.But Reuters reported that Beijing's appears 'aimed at inflicting political damage' by targeting market sectors based in parts of the U.S. from which the president draws his support.           The office of the U.S. Trade Representative released Trump's list of the products on Tuesday for public comment           GE was among companies reportedly weighing in about the trade war           ON DRUGS: Tariffs also would his Epinephrine and insulin           Catgut and pneumatic tires are among the products that would get hit       The office of the U.S. Trade Representative released the U.S. list of the products on Tuesday for public comment, the first step toward implementation.The tariffs would hit an array of products, from cars to motorcycles, boats, microscopes, rifle sites, and home appliances. Even prostheses, defibrillators, X-ray machines, and rocket launchers would be affected.The move followed China's action on Monday to slap $3 billion in tariffs on 100 U.S. products, and fulfilled actions directed by President Trump on March 22 that targeted steel and aluminum.The White House is getting pushback from powerful firms, including industrial giant General Electric and financial powerhouse Goldman Sachs.

'The economy is as strong as an ox.'
