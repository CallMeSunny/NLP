 The video was posted on Weibo, a Chinese micro-blogging platform, by an account named 'Qidi Daily' yesterday.As the video shows, the man repeatedly pushed the wooden pole and let it swing back to his crotch.He squatted in front of the pole to make sure it could hit his vital parts directly. Chinese people believe that the squatting position helps him transport his 'chi energy' down to his manhood, making it as hard as iron.         It is claimed that the stunt could treat erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculationThe Iron Crotch, as its name suggests, is a Kung Fu stunt which helps men to train themselves from being attacked in the groin. It is also considered to bring health benefits to men as the exercise regime could stimulate the blood circulation and improve the flexibility of the tissues around the testicles.Preparatory exercises and guidance are mandatory before performing the stunt.         Transporting the chi down to the crotch and staying focus are the key to the 'Iron Crotch' stuntAccording to Kung Fu masters, before practising 'Iron Crotch', a man needs to focus on his body sensation and massage his testicles, such as pushing them outwards.Such exercise has to be done for at least 300 to 500 times per day in order to reach the level of the man from the video.To practise the 'Iron Crotch' stunt, other forms of exercise include attaching weights to the crotch or dragging heavy objects using the crotch are advised to do so.However, these exercises are not supported by the Western doctors to prevent erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation.
