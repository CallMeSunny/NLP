China flew two nuclear-capable bombers around Taiwan prior to Donald Trump's controversial phone call with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, it has emerged. Two Chinese Xian H-6 bombers, along with two escort planes, flew from mainland China and passed around Taiwan in international airspace on November 26.The surveillance operation, though legal, is an unprecedented sign of heightened tension between the two countries, Fox News reported - a tension made worse by the President-elect's conversation with Tsai on Friday, six days later.Scroll down for video       Bomber: China flew two H-6 bombers (one pictured with fighter jets in September) around Taiwan on November 26. The H-6 is capable of dropping nuclear bombs         Dispute: Both China and Taiwan claim to own each-others' territories, a long feud held since WWII. The Chinese planes conducted surveillance on Taiwan and Japan              Controversial: On Friday Donald Trump and Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen (right) talked by phone. That went against long-standing US policy that recognizes only China as a real country Watch the latest video at &lt;a href="http://video.foxnews.com"&gt;video.foxnews.com&lt;/a&gt; The two bombers set off and landed from different military bases, accompanied by two escort planes, a Tupolev Tu-154 and Shaanxi Y-8, Fox reported.It was the first time that China had ever attempted such an act, a Taiwanese official claimed. China has said it won't be the last.The escort planes - which at one point also included J-10 and Su-30 fighter jets - were used to conduct surveillance on Japan and other US allies in the region, a source said.In response, Japan scrambled eight F-15 fighter jets to intercept the planes, although they never entered Taiwanese airspace.'Taiwan faces a much more serious Chinese challenge than it has ever faced before,' Anthony H Cordesman, the Arleigh A Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. 'China has steadily built up a massive military capability in the area around Taiwan. This isn't simply a matter of flying bombers.'   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       White House rebuke for Trump over Taiwan phone call as Obama...    An inconvenient (and boring) meeting?

 However, he pointed out that the US is in a difficult situation if it wants to object to the movement. 'Understand that technically, we can't object to flying bombers near Taiwan if we are flying combat aircraft and reconnaissance aircraft near China,' he said. 'This is simply legal under international law.'Both Taiwan and Beijing have claims on the same territory so foreign countries, like the United States, cannot recognize both. And tensions between the two have been raised recently after the election in May of Tsai, whose party maintains that Taiwan is an independent state in function if not name. Her predecessor's party were in favor of eventual reunification.It was in that atmosphere - and the wake of the bomber campaign - that Trump and Tsai had their conversation Friday. Trump says that it was initiated by Tsai as a congratulatory phone call.       Upset: China was upset by Trump's call, although the White House on Monday reaffirmed the US's acknowledgement of China's claim (pictured: A H-6 at a Chinese flight show in November)       The White House under Barack Obama on Monday reaffirmed its 'One China' policy, in which it recognizes the PRC as a legitimate country and not Taiwan, but continues a fruitful unofficial relationship with the Republic of China.In this way it's able to sell arms to Taiwan - maintaining its military strength - while continuing economic co-operation with mainland China.The White House remark from the White House came after a Twitter tirade Sunday in which Donald Trump lambasted China after strong criticism of his talk with Tsai.'Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the US doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I don't think so!' he tweeted. All this comes after an increasingly militarily pushy China spent the past few years building islands in the South China Sea, militarizing them and trying to claim ownership of officially recognized international waters.The US Navy has performed several passes through those waters with aircraft carrier groups to keep China in check.          Defensive: Trump defended himself on Twitter late Sunday by denouncing Chinese policies on trade and its military actions in the South China Sea         Angry: 'Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency, tax our products or build a massive military complex in the South China Sea? I don't think so!' the president-elect tweeted WHY DO TAIWAN AND CHINA HATE EACH OTHER? The governments of Taiwan and China - officially known as The Republic of China (RoC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC), respectively - both officially claim ownership of each-other's territories.The origins of that argument lie before World War II, when the government of the RoC, which had overthrown the Qing Dynasty, faced a challenge from a peasant uprising organized by Mao Zedong, who accused it of corruption.The government of the Republic of China and its leader, Chiang Kai-Shek, were routed from mainland China by Mao and his allies in Soviet Russia, and took up residence on Taiwan.Eventually Taiwan evolved from authoritarian rule into a democratic government, but it has always maintained that it is the 'true' Chinese government in exile.Mao's PRC, meanwhile, says that it has the official government mandate, and took it from the RoC just as the RoC took it from the Qing Emperor.The RoC was a charter member of the United Nations in 1945, and a member of the Joint Security Council.At the time the West, which strongly opposed Mao's Communist rule, accepted the RoC as the true representative of all of China.Through the 1960s, however, the admission of more Mao-friendly countries into the UN saw opinion shifting more in favor of the PRC.In 1971, the UN voted to recognize the PRC as a representatives of China, and the RoC was expelled. The US, notably, voted against the resolution, even though that year had seen relations between the US and Chairman Mao's China normalizing under Richard Nixon. Since then the two governments have waged a subtle - and not so subtle - war of words, both trying to claim ownership of all of China. Recognition of the RoC as a separate country varies from nation to nation.The depth of feeling on both sides of the dispute is incredibly strong, although younger generations are leaning more in favor of independence from mainland China than ever before.However, any attempt to declare independence would likely incur the wrath of the PRC military.
