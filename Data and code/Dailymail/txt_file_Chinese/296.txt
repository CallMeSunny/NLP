The ultimate race: Some of them got up as early as 5am in order to get ahead of the lines         Run, run, run: They are preparing for an upcoming exam and want to find a quiet place to studyThe video also showed that a large number of students scrambled to get through the library's front door. It's understood that these students were studying for the National Postgraduate Admission Examination, which is to be held from December 24 to 26 around the country. All of them would have prepared for the three-day exam for about a year. WHY DO THESE CHINESE STUDENTS STUDY SO HARD?

They have to study harder and longer to satisfy their career ambition.More than two million candidates have signed up for the upcoming exam around China, a 13.6 per cent increase from 2016, according to enol.cn. It's not known yet how many postgraduate students schools will be recruiting this year.
