President Trump unloaded on China and the European Union on Tuesday for trade practices he said are abusive.Trump said at a joint news conference with the president of Poland that he can no longer allow other nations railroad the United States.'We are the piggy bank to the world. We have been ripped off by China. We have been ripped off by, excuse me Mr. President, the European Union, of which you're a part of. We've been ripped off by everybody,' he contended. 'And we're not being ripped off, you will see in a little while.'In rambling remarks on trade that touched on deals with Canada, Mexico and South Korea, the U.S. president insisted he was 'right' about trade disputes with nations like China.          President Trump unloaded on China and the European Union on Tuesday for trade practices he said are abusiveTrump said the process of rewriting America's trade deals 'takes a little time' but he's found tariffs to be an effective form of tinder, especially when it comes to negotiating with Europe.'Jean-Claude, I like him, but he's tough, he's nasty, the kind of guy I want negotiating for me. He's a tough tough cookie,' the president said of European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker. 'He didn't want to renegotiate, and after three times he still didn't want to renegotiate.'So, Trump says he told Juncker, 'We're going to put a tariff on all of the millions of cars you send into the United States. 'And honestly, he was in my office so quickly from Europe that I didn't know there were planes that fly that fast.' Trump insisted that he was right about the numerous trade deficits he railed against as a candidate that he's working now to correct.'I talked about Japan. I was right, I talked about China. I was right. It's what I do. And I like doing it, but I like doing it for the people, because our country has been abused and taken advantage of by virtually every country,' he said.The president was especially hard on China, which he said was built on the back of the American worker. Trump said that China owes the U.S. billions in trade deficits and 'other liabilities' he did not outline but were most-likely a reference to the alleged currency manipulation and intellectual property violations he's previously harped on.         NASTY: 'Jean-Claude, I like him, but he's tough, he's nasty, the kind of guy I want negotiating for me. He's a tough tough cookie,' the president said of European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker in his trade rantTrump said the American economy is 'going up like a rocket ship' since he imposed tariffs on China. Yesterday, he doubled down on the position, hitting Beijing with another $200 billion in penalties.In Tuesday morning tweets he further claimed without offering a citation that 'China has openly stated that they are actively trying to impact and change our election by attacking our farmers, ranchers and industrial workers because of their loyalty to me' and that China has been 'taking advantage of the United States on Trade for many years.''They also know that I am the one that knows how to stop it. There will be great and fast economic retaliation against China if our farmers, ranchers and/or industrial workers are targeted! he said.Trump on Monday served up $200 billion in tariffs on imports from China on Monday that will go into effect almost immediately as he launched the latest volley in the escalating trade war between the two countries.A White House statement said tariffs would start at 10 percent and go into effect in a week, on Sept. 24, before kicking into full gear at 25 percent at the start of the new calendar year. 'Further, if China takes retaliatory action against our farmers or other industries, we will immediately pursue phase three, which is tariffs on approximately $267 billion of additional imports,' a statement from Trump warned.         President Trump served up $200 billion in tariffs on imports from China on Monday that will go into effect almost immediately as he launched the latest volley in the escalating trade war between the two countries Trump threatened that nations that don't make 'fair' deals withe U.S. with getting 'Tariffed' on Monday morning as he prepared to slap the trade rival with the expected  $200 billion in penalties.He held up China as a case in point after reaching a new trade deal with Mexico earlier this month, telling a roundtable on Monday that 'China is now paying us billions of dollars, and we will see how that all works out.''I have great respect for President Xi, as you know. I was over there for two days with him. I have a lot of respect for China,' Trump said. 'But last year, we lost $375 billion in deficits, and we had, in my opinion, way over $500 billion in cash. And that’s not including certain items that we won’t even talk about,' he said, seemingly referring to alleged intellectual property violations.He added, 'So we’re not going to lose that. We can’t do that. We can’t do that anymore. It should have been done many years ago. It should have been done by other Presidents. And actually, it’s a disgrace that it wasn’t done.'Trump said that 'hopefully' the two countries will 'be able to work something out.''We’ll be having an announcement tonight after close of market, and that will take place,' he said, previewing the new tariffs. 'I think it’s going to work out very well with China. I think they want to make a deal. They do want to make a deal — that I can tell you. They want to make a deal.' Trump also proclaimed the U.S. steel industry the 'talk of the World' on Monday'Our Steel Industry is the talk of the World. It has been given new life, and is thriving. Billions of Dollars is being spent on new plants all around the country!' he wrote.  The trade penalties are message to Canada, a country with which the U.S. is currently engaged in a trade stand-off, as well as Europe, a heavy bearer of the steep steel and aluminum tariffs that were introduced earlier in the year by the president. 'Tariffs have put the U.S. in a very strong bargaining position, with Billions of Dollars, and Jobs, flowing into our Country - and yet cost increases have thus far been almost unnoticeable. If countries will not make fair deals with us, they will be 'Tariffed!' Trump on Monday morning tweeted.    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       'Our democracy is in crisis': Hillary Clinton SLAMS...    'He literally tried to murder me': Tom Arnold is pictured...

He didn't answer directly when asked whether Beijing would back out if U.S. President Donald Trump goes ahead with a proposed tariff hike on $200 billion of Chinese goods.If an increase goes ahead, 'China will have to take necessary countermeasures,' said Geng at a regular daily briefing.Chinese authorities have yet to confirm what steps aside from retaliatory tariffs they might take. But they have threatened 'comprehensive measures' as Beijing runs out of imports for penalties due to its lopsided trade balance with the United States.
