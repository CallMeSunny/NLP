It is an insult often slung at only children by those who grew up with brothers and sisters.But an MRI scan has revealed children may actually be more annoying and selfish, because of changes to the structure of their brain.Only children have different brains which make them both more creative and less agreeable, a Chinese study suggests.They have extra grey matter in the supramarginal gyrus, part of the brain thought to help only children come up with new ideas and think out of the box.         An MRI scan has found that, because of changes to the structure of their brains, only children may be more annoying and selfishÂ They might be able to thank the extra time on their own, thinking independently, as a child.However, the study adds, only children have less grey matter in the medial prefrontal cortex, which governs agreeableness.It says the extra attention from their parents and grandparents could make them worse at getting along with others, behaving selfishly and with less empathy for others.The authors, from Southwest University in Chongqing, China, write in the journal Brain Imaging and Behaviour: 'Due to the absence of siblings, only children usually miss out on important opportunities to rehearse some of the more complicated aspects of relationships within a safe environment and also miss many opportunities to develop psychosocial skills, emotional support and learning opportunities compared with non-only-children.'

 They add that, while extra parental attention can be a good thing for creativity, it may also 'cause undesirable personality traits in the children, such as dependency, selfishness and social ineptitude'.The results could explain why Frank Sinatra, the only child of Italian immigrants, is a singer. But they might also shed light on why philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, another only child, believed hell was other people.Scientists from Southwest University examined 270 college students, scanning their brains and giving them personality tests. Half of them had siblings, while the other half did not.The scientists said there was a clear rise in creativity, and a clear fall in agreeableness, among those who grew up alone. They also found corresponding changes in brain structure.         A new Chinese study has found that only children have different brains which make them both more creative and less agreeableThe authors write: 'These findings may suggest that family environment (i.e. only child vs non-only child) may play important roles in the development of the behaviour and brain structure of individuals.'Only children, according to previous research cited in the paper, spend more time with their parents and are more aware of their expectations.It states: 'Many studies have proven that expectations have a strong influence on cognitive performance, including instance creativity.'Additionally, only children might have more opportunities for independent activity, and independence is strongly related to creative thinking.'But the only children are said to potentially be lacking in empathy and the ability to properly process social information.The study concludes: 'As a result of the absence of siblings and receiving excessive attention and too much praise from their parents and grandparents, only children may develop fewer psychosocial skills than non-only children.'
