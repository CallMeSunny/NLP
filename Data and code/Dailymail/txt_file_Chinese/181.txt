As a country with insatiable appetite for adventure, China has found its new favourite activity: via ferrata rock climbing.Just like how glass-bottomed bridges have popped up across the country overnight, tourist attractions have now flocked to install via ferrata climbing paths on dangerous-looking rock faces. A via ferrata is a path used to climb a mountain with a safety system permanently installed. It gives people who have little or no experience in rock climbing the opportunity to move through spectacular mountain scenery without heavy-duty climbing equipment.          more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  MP Charles Walker says 'ITV should stop making Jeremy Kyle Show'       Watch video  Nigel Farage defends where Brexit Party funding is coming from       Watch video  Student snatches the weave off his substitute teacher in AL       Watch video  Lorry swerves into car in the left-hand lane on the M1           Watch video  Felicity Huffman arrives to court and is expected to plead guilty       Watch video  Shaman Durek explains his teachings and philosophy       Watch video  'We have to deliver Brexit urgently': Andrea Leadsom       Watch video  IKEA advertise a kitchen area by putting it at monkeys disposal           Watch video  Kerri-Anne Kennerley unleashes on Bill Shorten       Watch video  Nigel Farage and New European editor Matt Kelly clash over Brexit       Watch video  Fergus Kenny blasted by Jeremy Kyle during show broadcast in 2016       Watch video  Trump says it would be mistake if Iran do anything against U.S.

 A video shared by China's Xinhua News Agency on Twitter shows dozens of daredevil tourists climbing across the cliff faces near the top of a peak in the renowned Yandang Mountain, eastern China. Opened last September, the £1 million project has two routes, one measuring 423 metres (1,378 feet) long and 260 metres (853 feet) high and one measuring 800 metres (2,624 feet) long and 290 metres (950 feet) high.Both routes are fitted near the top of the 300-metre-tall (984-foot-tall) Taping Peak.Fang Yuan, the General Manager of the Yandang Mountain Via Ferrata Paths, expected via ferrata to be one of the most popular adventurous tourist activities in China in the years to come.  Mr Fang claimed that as many as 800 people would be able to climb the mountain simultaneously using via ferrata zip lines.Last October, 19 tourists were trapped on the Yandang via ferrata after running out of strength, according to Zhejiang Online. Mr Fang insisted that the incident was a single case and that no one was injured. He explained that their via ferrata paths were 'so safe that even children could climb it'. He also explained that every 15 tourists would be accompanied by one coach.          An adventurous couple pose for wedding pictures on Yandang mountain's via ferrata route which opened last September         The via ferrata rock-climbing routes on Yandang Mountain are built on the cliff faces near the top of a 984ft tall peakThe country has seen 30 or so via ferrata paths being built in different parts in the past year, according to Mr Fang, who also claimed that Chinese people's passion for glass-bottomed bridges were quickly declining.China has seen all kinds of perilous glass-bottomed bridge being built by scenic spots since 2015 - more than 70 in 2017 alone.One of the most famous glass-bottomed bridge is situated in Zhangjiajie in the mountain that has apparently inspired the American blockbuster Avatar.   The bridge spans approximately 430 metres (1,400 feet) across two peaks and is suspended 300 metres (984ft) above a sheer drop. It was the longest and highest glass bridge in the world when it opened.            more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  MP Charles Walker says 'ITV should stop making Jeremy Kyle Show'       Watch video  Nigel Farage defends where Brexit Party funding is coming from       Watch video  Student snatches the weave off his substitute teacher in AL       Watch video  Lorry swerves into car in the left-hand lane on the M1           Watch video  Felicity Huffman arrives to court and is expected to plead guilty       Watch video  Shaman Durek explains his teachings and philosophy       Watch video  'We have to deliver Brexit urgently': Andrea Leadsom       Watch video  IKEA advertise a kitchen area by putting it at monkeys disposal           Watch video  Kerri-Anne Kennerley unleashes on Bill Shorten       Watch video  Nigel Farage and New European editor Matt Kelly clash over Brexit       Watch video  Fergus Kenny blasted by Jeremy Kyle during show broadcast in 2016       Watch video  Trump says it would be mistake if Iran do anything against U.S.

     However, the Zhangjiajie bridge was forced to close 13 days after its grand opening due to overwhelming volume of tourists. It re-opened a month later after an upgrade in its safety system.The incident didn't damp Chinese tourists' passion for transparent walkways. Last year, the management of Taiheng Mountain deliberately made the see-through panels crack on a glass walkway at over 3,800 feet high. With the help of sensors and special effects, the glass floor would appear to shatter as the tourists walk on them - a way to make the visitors' journey more exciting.
