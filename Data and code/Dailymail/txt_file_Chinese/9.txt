 They have been nicknamed 'Strawberry' and 'Cherry' after their mother's favourite fruits.  The two girls' sibling rivalry was filmed by their father late last year when he accompanied his wife, 26-year-old Wang Lu, to an antenatal check.He recorded the footage because he was amused to see her unborn children reacting with each other. The 30-second clip shows the pair seemingly kicking and hitting each other. It became trending after Mr Tao uploaded it onto short-video app Douyin. While the tiny girls have made a name for being feisty, they have also endured a rocky journey to be born healthy.               Mr Tao filmed the ultrasound footage late last year which apparently shows his twin daughters 'boxing with each other for a few rounds' inside their mother who was 18 weeks pregnantYimo and Yi'an are a pair of rare 'MoMo twins', which means they shared the same amniotic sac and placenta inside their mother. Formally known as monochorionic monoamniotic twins, it's one of the highest risk twin pregnancies possible. Doctors told Mr Tao that the birth of his daughters were 'miraculous' as they had beaten 'one-in-30-million odds' to survive.According to statistics in the UK, MoMo twins are rare and occur in approximately 1 in 35,000 to 1 in 60,000 pregnancies. There is only a 50 per cent chance that MoMo twins will survive after the 26 week mark. The biggest risk with this pregnancy is that the umbilical cords - which are separate - will get tangled and knotted resulting in impaired blood flow to one or both of the babies. The twins were born on April 8 in the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University at 32 weeks via a caesarean section.Doctors said emergency surgery had to be arranged after nurses saw one of the twins' heart rate had suddenly dropped. They were then sent to stay at the hospital's Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for nearly a month before being transferred to a normal ward for observation.

And after she left, the older one wouldn't take milk properly, but after she was sent to the ward too, she started to drink milk well,' he explained.The sisters were allowed to leave the hospital this morning and the father is so relieved that his daughters are both home safe and sound.'This is the first time I have been a father. Now I am so emotional I want to cry.'He added: 'Finally, I no longer need to worry about getting a phone call from the hospital in the middle of the night.'  Both girls are now in stable condition.
