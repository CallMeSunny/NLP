         Theresa May caused shock by pausing the £18billion Hinkley Point scheme  China has delivered a thinly-veiled warning to Theresa May against cancelling the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant.The Chinese ambassador to London suggested 'mutual trust' between the countries will be damaged if the huge project does not go ahead. The new Prime Minister caused shock when she pressed pause on the £18 billion scheme just hours after the EDF board gave it the final go-ahead in July.David Cameron and former chancellor George Osborne made it a priority to attract investment from the fast-growing superpower, and a Chinese nuclear firm is jointly funding Hinkley Point C with French energy giant EDF.However, allies of Mrs May including her chief of staff Nick Timothy have voiced doubts about whether it it wise to allow China to be so closely involved with key infrastructure. Writing in the Financial Times today, Liu Xiaoming said that he hoped the UK would 'keep its door open' to China.

 Urging a quick decision, he outlined his country's experience in managing nuclear plants and Britain's energy needs. In his article, the ambassador insisted that the safety and security of the plant was ensured by the UK's regulatory authorities and China's record of 30 years of safe operation of nuclear facilities.He said Chinese companies had invested more in the UK than in Germany, France and Italy combined in the last five years and this was partly down to mutual trust and respect between the two countries.         Supporters say the Hinkley Point power plant is crucial to ensure steady energy suppliesHe said the mutual trust was the foundation for bilateral co-operation.'Right now, the China-UK relationship is at a crucial historical juncture,' he said.'I hope the UK will keep its door open to China and that the British government will continue to support Hinkley Point - and come to a decision as soon as possible so that the project can proceed smoothly.'He warned it had not been easy for the two countries to come this far.'As long as both sides cherish what has been achieved and continue to expand and deepen our co-operation across the board, bilateral relations will maintain their strong momentum and work for the well-being of both the Chinese and British people,' he added.
