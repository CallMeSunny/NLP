American and Chinese companies announced business deals worth $9billion shortly after President Trump touched down in Beijing. The 19 agreements were signed Wednesday at a ceremony attended by US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Chinese vice premier Wang Yang.They included a pledge by Chinese ecommerce company JD.com to buy more than $2billion of food products from the US over three years and a pact for Reignwood International to buy 50 more helicopters from US firm Bell Helicopter and sell them in China.There will be more agreements Thursday bringing the total value to $20billion. Such contract signings are a fixture of visits by foreign leaders to Beijing and often involve agreements the Chinese side saved for the event to showcase the country's importance as a market.          American and Chinese companies announced business deals worth $9billion shortly after President Trump touched down in Beijing          President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump exit Air Force One upon their arrival at Beijing Capital AirportAt the ceremony, vice premier Wang said deals signed between China and US firms would 'contribute to the stabilization of the general and overall economic relations between the two countries'.But some in the US business community have expressed worry that contract wins could come at the expense of resolving long-standing complaints over market access restrictions in China. The chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, William Zarit, expressed hope ahead of Mr Trump's arrival that the signing of business deals would not draw attention away from 'structural issues', including Chinese limits on foreign activity in finance, healthcare and other industries. The ceremony was a prelude to a 'more important' signing ceremony set for Thursday, Wang said. Among the companies expected to sign deals are Qualcomm, Boeing and Goldman Sachs.                'Welcome to China! I love you!' a group of children who were part of a Peking opera performance told the U.S. president this evening in Beijing         Trump took in an extra special performance of Peking opera on Wednesday during a grand tour of the Forbidden City put on by Chinese President Xi Jinping. President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are seen here in the Forbidden City with Xi and his wife Madame Peng Liyuan       The two leaders are expected to oversee the conclusion of around $20 billion of agreements, including major deals to export natural gas and soybeans.While the numbers are big, the multi-year deals are a drop in the bucket of the overall trade imbalance.China's trade surplus with the United States has ballooned in recent months as optimistic Americans splurge on China-made products.The balance in trade again tilted heavily in China's favour in October, hitting $26.6billion, up 10 percent on-year, according to customs data.And while it was down from September's $28.2billion, that figure marked the highest monthly surplus in at least three years. Bloomberg News said the figures mean China's surplus with the US could come in around the same as last year's $250 billion.Ross said at the ceremony that meetings between Trump and Xi will focus on addressing trade imbalances between the two countries.         The Trumps are at a private dinner now with Xi and his wife, Madame Peng LiyuanTrump has ratcheted up his criticism of China's massive trade surplus with the US - calling it 'embarrassing' and 'horrible' last week - and has accused Beijing of unfair trade practices, fuelling worries of increased tension between the world's two largest trading countries. All trade is beneficial: Why a trade deficit is not always bad The trade balance reflects the optimal response of individuals, firms, investors, and governments to changes in productive opportunities and needs throughout the world.In the words of trade expert Daniel T. Griswold: 'Nations do not trade with each other; people do. America's trade deficit with the rest of the world is only the sum of the individual choices made by American citizens. 'Those choices, to buy an import or to sell an export, only take place if both parties to the transaction believe it will make them better off. In this way, the 'balance of trade' is always positive.''Addressing the imbalance in China trade has been the central focus of collaborative discussions between President Trump and President Xi and achieving fair and reciprocal treatment for the companies is a shared objective,' Ross said.Data on Wednesday showed China's exports to the US rose 8.3 percent in October on the year, while imports grew 4.3 percent. That led to a trade surplus of $26.62 billion with the US last month, down from September's record $28.08 billion, but higher than recent trends. Xi Jinping said Wednesday that US President Donald Trump's first state visit to Beijing is expected to yield 'positive and important' results. Trump will also prioristise the North Korea question and will ask China to do more to help bring the rogue state to heel.The North Korea question will be 'high on the agenda' for Trump in China, a White House official told reporters on Air Force One.Mr Trump and First Lady Melania will spend two days in China's capital, hosted by China's President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan.
