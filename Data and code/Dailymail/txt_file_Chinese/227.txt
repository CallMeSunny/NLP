A Chinese couple who have saved many lives working in the hospital might not be able to save their own son because they couldn't afford the medical bills.The father Yuan Guohui, a doctor, and the mother Dai Qixia, a nurse, are asking the public to help them as they try to raise funds for their 14-month-old son, nicknamed An An.Born in October, 2016, in Chengdu, south-west China, An An has Marble Bone Disease, a rare congenital bone disease, and is given only months to live.         Yuan Guohui (right) and his wife Dai Qixia (left) are pictured with their elder son, who holds a sign reading 'little brother, we wait for you to come back safe and sound'. The Chinese couple are both medical professionals, but they can't afford the medical bills for their younger son         14-month-old An An (pictured) has Marble Bone Disease, a rare congenital bone disease. An An's doctors in Beijing told Mr Yuan that An An is not likely to live past the age of two         Mr Yuan waits outside An An's hospital ward. The man has saved many lives working in an orthopaedics hospital in Chengdu, but now he is forced to see his own son dyingTiny An An was diagnosed with the condition at the end of last year, according to Chinese news site Eastday, citing Chengdu Business Daily. WHAT IS MARBLE BONE DISEASE  Marble Bone Disease is a more malignant variant of Osteopetrosis, a congenital skeletal disorder which affects 1 in every 200,000 individuals.Marble Bone Disease can cause short stature, cerebral calcification and mental retardation.   Osteopetrosis happens when the patient's osteoclasts, a type of bone cells, fail to resorb immature bone.It results in abnormal bone marrow cavity formation and bone marrow failure.Eventually the bones would become extremely dense, hard, and brittle. The disease is usually diagnosed shortly after birth and the patient's life span is usually two years. Osteopetrosis congenita  is almost always fatal.   Source:  American Family Physician, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children Prior to the diagnosis, his parents, who have two sons in total, already spent 10 months seeking medical attention for An An after realising the boy's eyes couldn't follow moving objects. Initially, some doctors in Chengdu thought An An suffered from damage to the optic nerve, and claimed the baby would go blind when he grew up; others claimed An An suffered from cerebral palsy.In order to clarify his son's condition and treat his son, 35-year-old Yuan quit his job at the Department of Physiatry at an orthopaedics hospital in Dayi County, Chengdu, reported Yitu Media. The man and his wife took An An to different hospitals in Chengdu, a provincial capital, and finally to Beijing, the capital city of China.During the ordeal, the couple spent all of their savings, which was said to be 200,000 yuan (£22,360).Eventually, doctors at the Beijing Children's Hospital confirmed that An An has Marble Bone Disease, but by then Mr Yuan and Ms Dai couldn't no longer afford expensive treatment. According to Chengdu Business Daily, An An's doctors told Mr Yuan that An An is not likely to live past the age of two.         Dai Qixia, a nurse, holds her son An An in her arms as she looks after him in the hospital. Ms Dai and her husband have spent all their savings travelling around China to treat their second child         Ms Yuan has decided to donate his own bone marrow to An An as a half-match donor in order to save the child under limited time. However, the operation and treatment costs over £113K              An An just celebrated his first birthday not long ago (right), but shortly afterwards the boy was diagnosed with Marble Bone Disease, a congenital disorder that causes bone marrow failureThe couple were apparently told to prepare themselves for bad news in the next three to six months.The doctors also said the only way to save An An is to have bone marrow transplant. As the time left for the family to find a fully matched donor was limited, Ms Yuan decided to donate his own bone marrow to An An as a half-match donor. However, the couple were then told the cost for the transplant and follow-up treatment would amount more than one million yuan (£113,600).Family members even told Mr Yuan to give up on An An, but the father refused.         Ms Dai and her husband reportedly spent all of their savings, which was said to be £22,360, as they took An An around China for medical attention in the space of 10 months last year         The Chinese public have teamed up to save the toddler who needs a bone marrow transplantHe reportedly said: 'How can I see my child turning into a marble without doing anything?'The couple made pleas of help to the public. Volunteers from the Big Tree Charity Organisation in Shanghai have set up a crowdfunding page for An An on Tencent, one of the largest internet portals in China.As of writing, the family have received 386,342 yuan (£43,896) of donations.
