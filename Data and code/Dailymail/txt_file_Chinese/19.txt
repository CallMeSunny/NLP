Wealthy families from China are alleged to be among the most lucrative clients of William 'Rick' Singer, the mastermind behind the Varsity Blues college admissions scandal. The scandal, which allegedly saw rich parents pay large sums of money to Singer to get their child places at elite universities, has seen more than 50 people implicated, including actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman.However, as more details emerge it appears that families from China's burgeoning middle class were also keen to take advantage of the illicit scheme, with Singer allegedly raking in $6.5million in one deal alone, according to ABC News.           Wealthy families from China are alleged to be among the most lucrative clients of William 'Rick' Singer, the mastermind behind the Varsity Blues college admissions scandalSinger, who ran a college counseling service called Key Worldwide Foundation, pleaded guilty to helping students get into their chosen colleges either by cheating on the SATs or ACTs or by falsely claiming some of the applicants were student-athletes. Singer accepted $25million in bribes to carry out the cheating schemes, according to the indictment.Another Chinese student's family paid Singer $1.2million to get her into Yale University, according to court documents, which identify the student as 'Yale Applicant 1.'That student was Sherry Guo, 21, who moved to Southern California from China to attend high school in the U.S. Guo has not been charged in the scandal, ABC News report.

 'She [Guo] has a very unique case, so we'll see how this unfolds,' attorney James Spertus of Spertus, Landes & Umhofer LLP said in a statement.'Ms Guo was not familiar with how people apply to schools in the United States. 'She wanted to go to Columbia University or Oxford University. She didn't want to apply to Yale, but that was where Rick Singer had his connections so that's where he pushed her to apply, much to her disappointment. 'In China, students are told where to attend school. So culturally speaking, Rick Singer's instructions to her didn't seem as out of place as they would to a student who grew up in the United States and has more of an expectation of free choice. 'I just don't think the question of guilt is clear-cut in Sherry's case, at all.'         Singer, who ran a college counseling service called Key Worldwide Foundation, pleaded guilty to helping students get into their chosen colleges either by cheating on the SATs or ACTs or by falsely claiming some of the applicants were talented student-athletesIn total, 20 people have agreed to plead guilty since prosecutors unveiled the case on March 12, including 'Desperate Housewives' actress Huffman, who is scheduled to plead guilty on May 21.Three former coaches have also agreed to plead guilty. On Tuesday, a former University of Southern California assistant women's soccer coach agreed to plead guilty for her part in the scheme.Thirty-three parents were among those charged, including 'Full House' star Loughlin, who has pleaded not guilty to paying bribes to get her two daughters admitted to USC. Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli allegedly paid $500,000 to get their daughters into USC as rowing recruits, despite the fact that neither girl competed in the sport.         Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli allegedly paid $500,000 to get their daughters into USC as rowing recruits, despite the fact that neither girl competed in the sportHuffman allegedly paid $15,000 to have a proctor secretly change the answers on her daughter's SAT answers to help her performance on the college entrance exam.Early Friday, the DailyMail.com revealed that Loughlin and Giannulli have joined with other co-defendants and prosecutors to agree to a protective order that will keep under seal all 'academic records or information containing academic records.' The protective order will also include any 'college applications, including grades, test scores and essays (both draft and final)' along with 'any wiretap or consensual recordings that contain information about children or uncharged co-conspirators.' It is believed investigators obtained recording of Loughlin. Any reference to a child's health information including mental health or psychological information is also to remain under seal.Lawyers for the families and the prosecutors are asking the judge to sign off on the agreed upon protective order over the evidence.Some of the parents have asked for a provision that after 60 days of the discovery materials being turned over to them by the government, some defendants want to be able to use the material that relates to them freely as they wish.The order does not specify if Loughlin and her husband are among the defendants seeking that provision to be added.The scam first came to light back in 2018 because of a corrupt coach.Yale soccer coach Rudy Meredith allegedly offered to secure a spot at the Ivy League institution to one deep-pocketed father for a hefty sum of $450,000.Unfortunately for Meredith and the 49 other individuals now awaiting trial, that deal happened to be offered by a financial executive who was being investigated by the FBI for securities fraud.And so, in hopes that he would be granted some leniency in his own case, the man told the FBI about the scheme Meredith was running at Yale.Meredith soon flipped and became a cooperating witness in the case alongside mastermind Singer.
