 The girls' parents, who sat with them as they spoke to the anchors, also got emotional. Audrey's mother put her hands around Gracie's face, asking: 'Can I just touch you?'It was Jennifer Doering, Audrey's mother, who found out her daughter had a sibling. Audrey had asked for a sister for Christmas this year, but Jennifer had a different idea: she wanted to give her daughter a copy of her 'finding ad', which is a photo that gets published in Chinese newspapers when a baby is placed in an orphanage.         This photo, which shows the two girls as babies with their Chinese foster mother, led Audrey's mother to realize her daughter had a sibling. She later tracked down the Rainsberrys          Audrey (third from left) and Gracie sat down with their parents and the hosts of 'Good Morning America' after their emotional reunion.
