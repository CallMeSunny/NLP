One of the people on stage looked at his friend who had fallen asleep         No waking her: After looking into the dog's eyes, this woman could not be woken upFellow judge David Walliams said: 'Simon being hypnotised by a dog was quite peculiar because he was very keen to get on stage to be hypnotised by this dog.
