 The video, shared by Pear Video, was filmed in Changzhou, east China's Jiangsu Province, on April 20. The black dog was playing with its companion, a smaller dog, in an alley when two men on a motorbike approached.One of them, sitting on the rear seat, pointed at the canine with a gun-shaped tool. He seemed to have shot something into the dog's body.Seconds later, the pair drove off as the smaller dog chased and barked after them. The black dog ran back home to find its male owner who rushed out of the gates. However, he failed to catch the suspects.          The canine then ran to a court yard to find his female owner so that he could bid farewell to her         The dog had become weak when it saw the owner and started twitching on the groundThe canine then quickly ran into a courtyard to find a woman, who is thought to be the man's wife.It appears that the woman was unaware that her pet had been poisoned as she walked towards the dog trying to check on it.The canine, on the other hand, had become so weak. It tried to stand up to let its owner pet him, but its repeated effort failed. Soon after, it started twitching. One minute later, it died.         One minute later, the dog died after being poisoned by two suspected in an alley         This is thought to be the poisonous needle which had been shot into the dog's bodyPet theft is thought to be the driving force behind the dog meat trade in China, which in turn has prompted some controversial public events, such as the Yulin Dog Meat Festival in southern China every June.Official statistics on dog theft are not collect by the Chinese authority. However, according to animal welfare organisations, around 10 million canines are killed and eaten each year in China, and most of them are stolen from the street or backyards.Wendy Higgins, who works for Humane Society International, said that dog thieves would sometimes poison pet dogs and return to collect their bodies later. The pair featured in the video were likely to be doing so.Humane Society International has in the past found piles of collars discarded in the corner when they visited slaughterhouses in China, and these collars 'indicated the stealing and killing of someone's loyal canine or feline companion'.Mrs Higgins also said that the pet dogs are stolen, they are usually crammed into crates, loaded onto trucks and driven for days or even weeks to be transported to markets and restaurants across China.

TAIWAN BANS EATING DOGS AND CATS IN ASIA'S FIRST  Taiwan has banned the eating of dogs and cats, lawmakers said on April 12, as pressure grows to improve animal welfare after a spate of cruelty cases that stirred public outrage.Parliament passed legislation to outlaw the consumption, purchase or possession of dog and cat meat, with offenders facing a fine of up to Tw$250,000 ($8,170).Authorities can also name and shame those who break the law.Legislator Wang Yu-min hailed the landmark bill, saying it is a first in Asia and 'shows that Taiwan is a society with advanced animal welfare.' The bill also hiked the penalty for killing or abusing animals to a maximum two-year jail term and a stiff fine of Tw$2 million.Source: AFP
