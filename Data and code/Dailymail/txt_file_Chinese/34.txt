 'Our education and training centres have been set up according to our needs. The students that come in to learn, it's a dynamic number that changes,' Shohrat Zakir, the chairman of Xinjiang's government, told journalists on the sidelines of China's annual parliamentary meeting.'As a whole, the number of people in the education centres should be less and less, and if one day society no longer needs it, these education centres can gradually disappear,' he said, without providing the number of people at the facilities.In an 18-minute-long reply to a journalist's question, Zakir defended the centres, saying that they taught Xinjiang residents Chinese, helped them gain awareness of the law, improved vocational skills, and were vital in the region's fight against extremism.'When (students) are able to distinguish between right and wrong and able to resist the infiltration of extreme thoughts... they have a strong desire to get rid of poverty and get rich, actively pursuing a better life,' he added.

Like his immediate predecessors as Xinjiang governor, Zakir is from the region's native Uighur ethnic group, providing a public face for the government and its claims that Xinjiang is an autonomous region. However, the real decision-making power resides with the region's ruling Communist Party chief, who is most often part of the country's Han Chinese ethnic majority.Current Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo is known for hard-line policies which he previously enacted while serving in the same capacity in the Buddhist region of Tibet. Observers say Chen has now brought an even greater degree of heavy security and surveillance to Xinjiang, where police checkpoints and facial recognition-equipped CCTV cameras have become ubiquitous in recent years. Journalists are harassed and surveilled by local authorities when reporting in the western Chinese region. 'There's just a very tragic, and I think, a horrific situation there,' US envoy on religious freedom Sam Brownback told reporters in a conference call.        Chen Quanguo, Communist Party secretary of Xinjiang, speaks at meeting on the sidelines of China's National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing on Tuesday. Chen is known for hard-line policies which he previously enacted while serving in the same capacity in Tibet       Xinjiang, which shares a border with several countries including Pakistan and Afghanistan, has long suffered from violent unrest, which China claims is orchestrated by an organised 'terrorist' movement seeking the region's independence.It has implemented a massive, high-tech security crackdown, which it says has prevented any violent incidents in over two years.But many Uighurs and Xinjiang experts say the violent episodes stem largely from spontaneous outbursts of anger at Chinese cultural and religious repression, and that Beijing plays up terrorism to justify tight control of the resource-rich region.While it previously denied the existence of the camps, Beijing has moved towards acknowledging their existence - but insists they are for 'vocational education' and are vital in the fight against separatist sentiments and religious extremism.It has also gone on a public relations blitz since last October in a bid to counter a global outcry against the camps by inviting diplomats and journalists to tour the centres.What are China's Muslim 're-education' camps?        The entrance to a jail which locals say is used to hold those undergoing political indoctrination program in Korla in western China's Xinjiang regionChinese authorities in the heavily Muslim region of Xinjiang are believed to have ensnared tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of Muslim Chinese - and even foreign citizens - in mass internment camps since spring last year.Such detention campaigns have swept across Xinjiang, a territory half the area of India, leading to what a US commission on China said is 'the largest mass incarceration of a minority population in the world today'.Chinese officials have largely avoided comment on the camps, but some are quoted in state media as saying that ideological changes are needed to fight separatism and Islamic extremism. Radical Muslim Uighurs have killed hundreds in recent years, and China considers the region a threat to peace in a country where the majority is Han Chinese.The internment programme aims to rewire the political thinking of detainees, erase their Islamic beliefs and reshape their very identities, it is claimed. The camps have expanded rapidly over the past year, with almost no judicial process or legal paperwork. Detainees who most vigorously criticise the people and things they love are rewarded, and those who refuse to do so are punished with solitary confinement, beatings and food deprivation.
