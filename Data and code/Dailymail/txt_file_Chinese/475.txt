A dairy cow with a fifth 'leg' is living happy and healthy after being rescued by a kind farmer shortly after it was born WHAT CAUSED THE 'FIFTH LEG'?  The cow appears to have a fifth leg coming out of its back.  Huang Weiquan, a local breeder, said the cow is not really deformed or a mutant as many believe, but simply the only survivor in what was once a pair of twins.He explained: 'The twin egg did not separate properly during fertilisation, so it resulted in the extra leg growing on the back.The limb does not appear to have developed over the months, and local agricultural experts said they do not expect it to affect the animal's well-being.
