A group of 'shockingly diverse' dinosaur footprints has been found in China by an amateur researcher dubbed the 'dinosaur hunter'.The fossilised footprints, more than 300 of them, were believed to come from extremely diverse dinosaurs roaming the earth during the Cretaceous Period.Experts say the tracks in eastern China were left by at least seven types of dinosaurs. They included meat eaters and plant eaters ranging from 50 centimetres (1.6 feet) to 10 metres (32 feet) long.                Incredible discovery: A fossil site containing hundreds of precious dinosaur footprints has been found in Tangcheng County, east China. Scientists have been stunned by the findings              China's 'dinosaur hunter': The footprints (left) were first discovered by dinosaur fan Tang Yonggang.

 The fossil site was formed around 120 million years ago and is situated in Tancheng County's Li Zhuang Town, an area known for its diamond deposits. It was first discovered in 2015 by dinosaur fan Tang Yonggang, who is known in China as the 'dinosaur hunter'.According to Mr Tang's diary, he saw the footprints after driving 30 kilometres (18 miles) to the Golden Rooster Mountain Range on February 24. Mr Tang was exploring the region with a fossil collector, named Liu Yang.Mr Tang recalled in his diary: 'We got off the car and walked not even a dozen steps. What came to our sight was a pit that was nearly circular and 70 or 80 centimetres (27 to 31 inches) wide.' He immediately realised he could have stumped upon something valuable. He said: 'I instantly had a familiar feeling.' Mr Tang said he and Mr Liu then found more pits stretching as far as eyes can see.'Although the temperature was low, we were already warmed up by the excitement of the discovery,' wrote Mr Tang.  A team of Chinese experts visited the area in 2017 after learning about the fossils from Mr Tang. Their discovery was recently published.         Precious findings: Professor Xing Lida is pictured inspecting one footprint in Tancheng              Scientists have also found four 'unprecedented' two-toe dinosaur tracks which are parallel (one footprint is pictured on the right). Professor Xing said the tracks were left by deinonychus dinosaurs, which had three toes but their third toe never touched the ground (as pictured left)'The diversity of the dinosaur footprints is truly shocking, ' said Chinese palaeontologist Wang Xiaoli. 'No dinosaur skeletons have ever been found in this area. Only footprints could tell us what kinds of dinosaurs used to live here,' said professor Wang, who is the head of the Institute of Paleontology and Geology at Linyi University.The group of footprints came from carnivorous dinosaurs and phytophagous dinosaurs, including flying dinosaurs.         The fossil site is situated in Tancheng County's Li Zhuang Town, in China's Shandong ProvincePerhaps the most exciting discovery from the site is that the deinonychus dinosaurs - previously thought to be solitary - lived in groups.Scientists drew the conclusion after discovering four 'unprecedented' two-toe dinosaur tracks which are constantly parallel.Researchers explained that most of the two-toe footprints from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods were left by deinonychus dinosaurs. The genus of carnivores includes the velociraptors which were made famous by film series Jurassic Park.'Each footprint measures seven to eight centimetres (2.7 to 3.1 inches). They compose four tracks that continue to run parallel to each other,' said Dr. Xing Lida, one of the researchers and an associated professor from China University of Geosciences, Beijing.'This is the typical trait of gregarious animals,' Dr. Xing said.         Experts discover the deinonychus dinosaurs - previously thought to be solitary - lived in groups. The genus includes the velociraptors (pictured) made famous by Jurassic ParkThese deinonychus dinosaurs were thought to be about one metre (3.2 feet) long and could run as fast as 2.4 metres (7.8 feet) per second. According to Prof. Martin Lockley, an expert in dinosaur tracks, the types of dinosaurs which used to roam Lizhuang town were 'very diverse'.Prof. Lockley said that the smallest meat eaters are only 50 centimetres long while the longest meat eaters could measure four metres (13 feet). They lived together with large plant eaters as long as 10 metres.The team's findings have been published on science journal Cretaceous Research.
