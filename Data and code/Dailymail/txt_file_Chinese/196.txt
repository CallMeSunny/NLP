The Chinese censors reportedly banned the usage of the letter 'n' on social media this week         The move was aimed to stop people criticising the proposal to extend Xi's presidency term   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Never-before-seen footage shows the corpses of dozens of...

 The censorship of the letter on Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter, was temporarily and the ban was lifted on Monday, according to US-based internet tracker China Digital Times.In addition to letter 'n', scores of terms have apparently been blocked by Beijing including 'my emperor', 'ascend the throne', 'I oppose', 'lifelong', and 'Winnie the Pooh' - the portly cartoon bear to which Xi has been compared.The country has shocked many observers by proposing the constitutional amendment to end the two-term limit for presidents.The rubber-stamp National People's Congress (NPC) is certain to endorse the move next week, meaning that Xi - already China's most powerful leader in decades - can stay as president beyond 2023.       Xi Jinping's (right) tightening grip on China had already earned the leader comparisons to Mao Zedong (left), but they came into even sharper focus after the party paved the way for him to assume the presidency indefinitely         Xi was formally handed a second term today as the President of China the 19th Communist Party Congress last October. He is seen voting at the closing ceremony of the congressLi Datong, a former editor at the state-run China Youth Daily, posted a draft letter urging legislators to vote against the move - which would abolish term limits set in 1982 under Deng Xiaoping to prevent a return to the decades of chaos under Mao Zedong.'It was the highest and most effective legal restriction meant to prevent autocracy or putting individuals above the party and the state,' said the letter. It was not sent to legislators but shared with hundreds of people in a private group on China's WeChat phone messaging app.'Lifting the term limits of national leaders will be ridiculed by civilised nations all over the world and also sow the seeds of chaos for China,' said the text posted on Monday.WeChat users trying to share screenshots of the letter saw their posts blocked.                     The two-term limit was inserted into the Constitution in 1982 to prevent future leaders from potential dictatorship. The change was made after Mao's (right) one-man rule for some 30 years.

The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, was even more profuse in its praise of the amendment in an editorial entitled 'Constitution change responds to new era'.Since Xi took power, it wrote, 'the new ruling team has not just been muddling along under the leadership of General Secretary Xi Jinping. Instead, it quickly started to deepen reforms in a comprehensive and magnificent way.'The newspaper took a shot at the political systems of the United States and Europe.'It has shaped and affected quite a few Chinese people's mindsets. But some key parts of the Western value system are collapsing. Democracy, which has been explored and practised by Western societies for hundreds of years, is ulcerating,' it said.'China cannot stop and take a break... our country must not be disturbed by the outside world or lose our confidence as the West grows increasingly vigilant toward China.'The administration of President Donald Trump, who has called Xi a friend but regularly clashes with Beijing over trade, had a guarded reaction to the Communist Party's move.'The president has talked about term limits in a number of capacities during the campaign and something that he supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that's up to China,' said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.
