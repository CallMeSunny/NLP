A Chinese airline boss has flown 186 passengers and 15 crew members from Beijing to Chicago with the help of recycled cooking oil.   Sun Jianfeng, the President of China's largest private air carrier Hainan Airlines, was the captain of the 11-hour flight which flew across the Pacific on November 21. This is the first time a Chinese airline has conducted an international flight with biofuel.          The Boeing 787 Dreamliner, powered partially by cooking oil, arrived in Chicago from Beijing         Sun Jianfeng (pictured), the President of Hainan Airlines, was the captain of the 11-hour flight         Biofuel is being added to the aeroplane in Beijing before it took off on November 21   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Terrifying moment concrete mixer carrying 80 TONNES of...

 The Boeing 787 Dreamliner took off at the Beijing Capital International Airport at 2:15pm local time on November 21. After flying 6,100 nautical miles (7,019 miles), it arrived at the Chicago's O'Hare International Airport at 12:12pm local time on the same day.The unprecedented flight was a part of a cooperation on 'green aviation' between China and the United States. The Beijing-Chicago route is chosen to be one of the 'green air routes' between the two countries.The aircraft used a type of made-in-China biofuel. The 'No. 1 Biofuel' blended by Sinopec is made with 15 per cent waste cooking oil and 85 per cent normal jet fuel.

Several airlines have been operating commercial fights using sustainable aviation diesels in the past few years.In March 2013, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced it would use cooking oil-based biofuel to power transatlantic flights between New York and Amsterdam for six months.Finnair flew an Airbus A330 on a nine-hour demonstration flight from Helsinki to New York, also using fuel partially made from cooking oil, in September 2014.In May this year, Singapore Airlines launched 'green package' flights on its San Francisco-Singapore route with the help of cooking oil as well. In January, Cathay Pacific, the flagship carrier of Hong Kong, announced it would switch to biofuels made from landfill rubbish on select long haul flights starting in 2019.
