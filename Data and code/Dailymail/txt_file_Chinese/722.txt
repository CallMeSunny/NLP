 Photos taken on July 18 show the students taking part in a special class for those who want to take the Chinese graduate student examination to enable them to go to some of China's top universities and complete a Master's degree. Pictures show students crammed into a giant hall, almost like a theatre, taking notes and listening to the lecture. A blue banner could be seen hanging inside the hall, which read: 'If you love him, tell him to take the graduate entrance examination, because it's heaven; if you hate him, tell him to take the graduate entrance examination, because it's hell.' The hall is so packed that there are even students sat behind the overhead projector, reports ce.cn. Summer holidays are a good time to try and cram in extra preparation time for the exam with many organisations offering refresher courses.  The number of applicants for the exam is continuing to rise mainly due to a growth in university graduates and the increasing struggle to find a job in the country. According to CCTV News, in 2016 there will be 7.6 million college graduates in China making it the highest number ever. One of China's recruitment websites said that recruitment demand only went up 4 percent in the first quarter this year, far less than expected. A report issued in April by the China Institute for Employment Research said that internet-related industries and finance are among the best job markets.  The examination is usually taken during the last year of an undergraduate's degree. The test is set to be held this coming December.           If students pass the exam then they gain access to some of the country's top universities to do their master's degree         Can you hear me at the back?Students pay attention to the lecture and take notes in probably the biggest class they have ever been in         The number of applicants for the exam is continuing to rise due to a growth in university graduates and increasing struggle to find a job         A few months until December: Pictures show the students paying attention to the giant projected lesson and taking notes
