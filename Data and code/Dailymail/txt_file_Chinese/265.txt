A visit to a barber shop in China could be a truly eye-opening experience. Apparently, barbers there don't just cut your hair, but also shave your eyes. An incredible video has emerged showing a barber using a sharp razor to give a customer a traditional health treatment, known as the 'eyeball shaving'.                A customer is undergoing treatment by renowned 'eyeball-shaving' barber Xiong Gaowu         Barber Xiong Gaowu (pictured) has been offering the service for over 40 years in Chengdu          Mr Xiong, 62, is seen cutting hair for a customer in an open-air barber shop in Chengdu   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Mother, 47, kills herself because her son's fiancée is 'too...

Instead, the barber would use a razor to gently sweep on the edges of one's eyelids.Xiong Gaowu, a 62-year-old barber, has been providing the service to his customers for over 40 years, according to People's Daily Online.Mr Xiong said he only offered the service to customers over 30 years old, as younger people tend not to have any 'dirt' in their eyes.         Another barber, Liu Deyuan, also offers 'eyeball shaving' service to his customers in Chengdu              Mr Liu gently sweeps the blades along the customer's eyelids for 30 seconds to remove dirtTo start the process, Mr Xiong first puts iodine solution on the razor for sterilisation. He then adds eye drops onto the blade.Mr Xiong then flips down the customer's lower eyelid, sweeping the blade on the customer's waterline - the tiny strip between one's eyelash line and the eyeball - for about 30 seconds. This is to scrape off the dirt and dust that's trapped between the skin and the eyeball.Then he repeats the same procedure on the upper lid.According to China News, Liu Deyuan, a 57-year-old barber, also provides the service to customers in Chengdu. But compared to Mr Xiong, Mr Liu has some extra steps.After scraping the customer's waterline, Mr Liu inserts a metal ball-tipped rod into the customer's upper eyelid.He carefully rolls the rod on top of the eyeball, then to the lower eyelid.          Besides hair cutting and eyeball shaving, Mr Xiong also provides massage service in his stall         A customer is enjoying a neck massage at Mr Xiong's hair-cutting stall on a street of ChengduA 97-year-old customer told China News that he felt he could see things clearer after the treatment.'My eyes were soar and dry and I felt there were stuff stuck in my eyes. But now they are all comfortable,' he said.Dr Qu Chao, an ophthalmologist at Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, said the 'eyeball shaving' treatment could stimulate the eyelids so the glands on the eyelids, known as the tarsal glands, could produce an oily substance.The oily substance, known as meibum, could lubricate eyeballs and make people feel more comfortable.Therefore, people who undergo the treatment are likely to feel more refreshed and see things more clearly.However, inappropriate gestures and unsterilised tools can cause infections to the eyes.Dr Qu recommended that people with soar or dry eyes should place a warm towel on top of their eyes for relief.
