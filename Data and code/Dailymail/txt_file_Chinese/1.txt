 Clips of the incident were trending on Chinese short-video platform Douyin today.The uploader of the videos, known as 'da meng ya', claimed to be a passenger on the plane. She alleged that one female passenger was attempting to stop the plane from leaving because her daughter had not arrived yet. The daughter was said to be late because she was shopping.The incident took place today on a flight from Bangkok to Shanghai operated by Chinese budget carrier Spring Airlines.  The flight 9c8892 was scheduled to take off at 3:30am from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport. The duty-free shops at the airport open 24 hours.              Footage posted by the eyewitness also shows the mother sitting on the jet bridge outside the aircraft as an airline worker talked to her. The four-hour flight was delayed for 30 minutes         The passenger (not the one above, file photo) was allegedly shopping at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport which caused her to be late for her flight back to ShanghaiThe Shanghai-based carrier has confirmed the incident to MailOnline after watching the trending clips, but did not specify the relation between the two passengers or their gender. The airline company said the flight was due to carry 162 passengers, including the passenger who had boarded and the passenger who had failed to arrive at the boarding gate.A spokesperson said the passenger who had boarded the plane was emotional and tried to block the cabin manager from closing the door.The passenger also claimed that her accompanying traveller, alleged to be her daughter, had called the airport police to demand the flight wait. The daughter had allegedly told the police she had checked in two pieces of luggage and left hand luggage on the plane - presumably through her mother.         The incident took place today on a flight by Chinese budget carrier Spring Airlines (file photo)The four-hour flight was delayed for 30 minutes after the two passengers agreed to give up their journey.The plane landed in Shanghai Pudong International Airport at 9:14am, more than one hour behind the schedule. Spring Airlines condemned the passengers' 'uncivilised' behaviour while Chinese web users urged the tourism authority to blacklist them.China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) in 2015 launched a series of regulations to penalise unruly tourists - a move from Beijing aimed at raising the public awareness of travel etiquette.Tourists deemed uncivilised by the authority could have a 'bad behaviour record' for up to ten years, which is likely to restrict their future travelling and harm credit record.People have been punished for various reasons, from throwing boiling water towards a flight attendant to sitting on top of an iconic Communist statue.
