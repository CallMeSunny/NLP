NATO is gearing up for its largest troop simulation in more than a decade to prepare for an invasion of Europe in the wake of Russia and China's huge show of military strength last month.The Trident Juncture exercises in Norway, which are due to start later this month, will involve 45,000 troops, 150 aircraft, 60 ships and 10,0000 vehicles from the 29 NATO nations.The war games, which are the biggest since 2002, will follow the massive Vostok 2018 joint military exercises between Russian and Chinese forces last month. Held in Siberia in eastern Russia, they involved nearly 300,000 Russian troops, which is nearly a third of the country's one-million-strong military.           Armoured personnel carriers from the German army bound for the Trident Juncture exercises are parked before being loaded onto ships in the port of of Emder in Emden, Germany         NATO troops take part in a massive amphibious landing during the Exercise Baltic Operations in Lithuania earlier this year         KFOR (Kosovo Force) soldiers serving in a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo stand a top of armoured vehicles         US and Polish army soldiers attend an official welcoming ceremony American troops deployed to Poland as part of NATO build-up in Eastern Europe in Zagan, Poland in January last yearSweden and Finland, which cooperate with NATO but are not members, will also take part in the simulations.The upcoming drills aim 'to ensure that NATO forces are trained, able to operate together, and ready to respond to any threat from any direction', NATO said in a statement given at a briefing at the Pentagon last Friday.Last week, a United States envoy warned Russia it must halt its covert development of a banned cruise missile system or it will seek to destroy it before it becomes operational.US Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison said Washington remained committed to a diplomatic solution but was prepared to consider a military strike if development of the medium-range system continued.

 Russia has not accepted an invitation for it to send observers to the military drills, but the admiral expects them to turn up. Admiral James Foggo, the top US admiral in Europe said Trident Juncture, 'will have a deterrent effect on anybody who might want to cross those borders, but one nation in particular. 'It's in their interest to come and to see what we do. And they'll learn things.'But you know what? I want them to be there so they can see how well we work together.'NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said there was concern about Russia's military interference in Ukraine and Georgia, support for Syria's Bashar Assad, and the buildup of Russia's naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean.
