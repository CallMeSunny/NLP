As Apple launched its new iPhone in association with the (RED) charity, many people in China shared their enthusiasm for the new colourful product.However those wishing to buy the product in China will be unaware that a proportion of the money goes to the (RED) organisation as the website omits any association with (RED) whatsoever.  China still has a stigma around HIV and AIDS despite the fact that the number of people contracting HIV is continuing to increase.         The ad on the Chinese site reads: 'We now present to you the red iPhone 7'          Whereas the UK site makes it clearly obvious that the phone is in association with (RED)   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       The 'vampire' terrorist: How a Kent schoolboy and 'friendly...

 The Chinese website shows the phone and only describes it as the new red version whereas all of the other different countries' websites note the fact that it is a special RED charity version. Even the Hong Kong website includes the (RED) information.There has always been a stigma in China around HIV and AIDS. Cases of HIV are rising sharply in the country. In 2016, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported 96,000 new HIV cases in the first nine months of that year.         Instead of saying where money goes, the description at the bottom just gives a phone number         Whereas the English website shows that money goes towards fighting AIDS and HIVDuring the 80s there was a government scandal in which people contracted HIV from dirty needles.  In the village of Wenlou, locals took part in a blood drive to earn some extra cash. However it was later revealed that the needles were unsanitary and caused the spread of HIV to 678 people, 200 of which have since died.2003 was the worst year for the village which saw 26 people die from the virus. Six died on the same day.Internet users have also questioned whether (RED)'s link to the Dalai Lama might be another cause behind the omission. (RED) have in the past posted a picture of the Dalai Lama who China considers to be a separatist on their website.  MailOnline has reached out to Apple for comment.
