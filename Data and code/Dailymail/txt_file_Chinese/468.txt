 Luckily, the man is said to have been struck by the sparks, not the bolt of the lightning. As such, the man didn't sustain major injuries. After being hit, Xiao Dong described that his arms, hands and fingers felt numb - as if 'ants were crawling over them'. He also reported pain in the palm. Xiao Dong was holding an umbrella with a metal handle as he reported in the storm. It's believed that the metal handle had attracted the electric charge towards him.His colleague, the cameraman, allegedly held an umbrella with a wooden handle, and he was not hit.

WEATHERMAN EXPLAINS HOW HE WAS HIT           Xiao Dong said he had been hit by the sparks, not the bolt of the lightning While describing the incident to Dalian Meteorological Bureau, the weatherman explained that the lightning had struck in distance, but he had been hit by the induced electric charge.He said that when a storm cloud forms, electric charge would accumulate underneath the cloud. As a result, the opposite charge would also accumulate near the ground, especially near heights, pointy roofs and metal objects.When an excess amount of the opposite charge comes into being, it would send sparks in the air, as what the video from yesterday showed.
