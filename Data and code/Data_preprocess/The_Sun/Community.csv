0,How Tory leadership race can lead to every Brit having a shot at the good life,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9125923/tory-leadership-race-lead-every-brit-shot-good-life/,"22nd May 2019, 12:28 am","BIG moments in history need big ideas.No one can deny that this is a big moment for Britain, with the painful Brexit process drawing to a close and the prospect of a new Prime Minister arriving within a few months.3 The Tory tree is looking pretty tatty these daysCopyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved3 A new Prime Minister could be arriving within a few months, so now is the time for big ideasThat is why One Nation Conservatives have produced a set of principles that we want to put to the leadership hopefuls, to test whether they agree with us.The ten principles cover our position in the world, the chances in life we want to give everyone, the affection we feel for our NHS and schools, the way we want our free enterprise economy to thrive and the future of our planet.I was shocked and disappointed to see Nick Timothy, in his article in The Sun yesterday, describe this as an “elitist, liberal agenda”.It is the exact opposite. It is the way for the Conservative Party to address the whole range of concerns of Sun readers, about their jobs, the safety of our streets and the future of their children.The One Nation principles go way beyond Brexit.'Our big ideas'AS One Nation Conservatives, we are united in belief in the following values: We believe in the United Kingdom. We are patriotic Conservatives who reject narrow nationalism.We believe the UK must be a world leader through aid, trade and security.We believe everyone has an equal right to a fair chance in life.We believe in a social contract between all of us as fellow citizens, supported in our tax and welfare system.We believe in public services, properly funded by a growing economy, as fundamental to the wellbeing of our nation.We believe in the importance of place and supporting local, civic and voluntary over the bureaucratic, statist and compulsory.We believe we all have a responsibility to act as stewards of our environment and a duty to show global leadership on climate change and biodiversity.We believe in free enterprise, business and the market economy with good regulation to enhance competition, support innovation, break monopolies, empower citizens.We believe in universal human rights and the rule of law and our record in promoting them through an independent judiciary, effective enforcement, community policing and policies to prevent crime and social breakdown.We believe civilised, open, respectful debate in our party, Parliament and a free Press, and a vibrant arts and cultural sector, are fundamental to our society.Of course, this is a key issue that needs solving quickly, and within our group of more than 60 MPs there are a range of views. But politics needs to be about more than Brexit.The European debate has divided us in so many ways. It has pitched London and other big cities against those living in smaller towns or the country-side. It has also divided the university-educated from those without degrees.Above all, it has introduced an element of personal hatred and nastiness into all our politics.I don’t agree with Nigel Farage on much. But I think it is disgusting that someone thinks it is right to throw a milkshake over him, and others, some of them political commentators, think it is just funny.Political violence of any kind has no place in Britain.‘GENEROUS, OUTWARD-LOOKING PATRIOTISM’So now, more than ever, is the time for politicians to look for what unites us.We desperately need to become One Nation again as we find a new role after Brexit in an increasingly dangerous world.As a lifelong Conservative, I believe a Conservative government following hard-headed but warm-hearted policies is the best way to promote national unity. Jeremy Corbyn’s hard-left ideas will certainly divide us as never before.Everyone in Britain deserves a shot at the good life.Getty - Pool3 Theresa May announces that she will give MPs a second referendum vote, if they back her EU dealThat’s why we say as one of our principles that everyone, whoever and wherever they are from, “has an equal right to a fair chance in life” and “bold reforms to welfare and vocational skills are central to tackling social injustice and creating an opportunity society”.I am sure every Sun reader would sign up to that, and that political leaders who delivered it would be successful both at elections and in making this a better country.Nick Timothy was particularly scathing about our concern for the environment. I am completely unapologetic about this.Any Conservative has a responsibility to preserve the best of our current world for future generations.We need to show that a belief in free markets and competition is not only compatible with creating a greener planet but is essential in achieving this.Innovations such as sun and wind power, and electric cars, mean we stop poisoning our air and our children’s lungs.At the same time, for a dynamic country such as ours, these green products are a huge economic opportunity. Britain can and should be a world leader in this field.As One Nation Conservatives we are also proud of our tradition of operating under the rule of law.A police force that operates as part of the community it is policing is much more effective in keeping our streets safe.This is another of our principles, as law and human rights are central to our vision of a harmonious and united country.Perhaps above all, we believe in the United Kingdom.It represents our shared values and it remains a force for good in the world.most read in opinionCommentJANE MOORE Time for something completely different…let's put the boot in at EU elections CommentALLY ROSS Graham Norton shouldn't have spared Madge's blushes as he lashed Eurovision acts CommentTHE SUN SAYS PM's desperate Brexit capitulation achieved nothing but alienating everyone CommentTHE SUN SAYS Hipster who threw MILKSHAKE achieved nothing but to recruit more Farage fans CommentNICK TIMOTHY Tinderbox Tories will get burned at the ballots - they need a new plan We are patriots but we want a generous and outward-looking patriotism instead of a narrow nationalism that turns its back on the rest of the world.The One Nation Conservatives have produced a Declaration of Values which points the way to the big ideas Britain needs at this tough but momentous time.We hope our party can follow these ideas toward a successful future.Boris Johnson avoids leadership questions one day after declaring he intends to stand against Prime Minister Theresa May"

Every morning I wake up it’s there.“It feels like my whole body is burning, I can feel it coming on even before it appears on my skin.“Some mornings my eyes are so swollen I can hardly see, then the hives are hot and itchy.“They are so red and distinctive, I even have them over the palms of my hands when I have a bad flare-up, there are large rings on my forehead and other parts become swollen.“It’s horrible I can’t look at myself during a flare-up and sometimes can hardly leave the room and definitely don’t even leave the house.“It is stopping me from doing so many things, I can’t make plans because if I have a flare-up I can’t go, it takes control of your life.Caters News Agency5 The rash is spread all over her body“My dad is getting married in September and I’m a bridesmaid. I’m worried because if I have a flare-up I won’t be able to go.“The thought of wearing a dress at my dad’s wedding with the rash terrifies me.“People think I have something contagious or that it’s ringworm. I was constantly being told I looked drained which made me feel worse.”Shauna has been experiencing urticaria for two years. But since November last year, after having a bad flare-up, her symptoms have become worse.She said: “It would die down initially then some mornings it will be the whole day — it’s mad how it comes up on you.“I was worried thinking it was Lyme disease because the welts were proper rings, but after samples and tests we found out it wasn’t.”Caters News Agency5 Red patches on Shauna's armCaters News Agency5 The rash even spreads to the palms of her handsShauna finds herself hiding away from others during particularly bad flare-ups when she is unable to cover her skin in long sleeves.And the young woman admits going out in public is humiliating — as she constantly gets stared at.Shauna said: “You can see people looking at you, even when you’re trying to hide it.“No one else really understands, apart from others in the urticaria community.

They are so happy there.“They love having the privacy to walk their dogs around the grounds and get fresh air as they await the start of their family.

So it is quite new and is probably something I would suggest the Queen would have reservations with.“It’s a definite break from tradition.

I don’t think this is necessarily a bad thing.“Harry knew what he was getting into when he married her, or got engaged to a single-minded, ambitious, successful American actress.“Clearly Meghan is no shrinking violet.”PA:Press Association9 Duncan said the announcement is evidence of Meghan's influence over HarryThe royal expert added that the move is yet more evidence that Prince William and Prince Harry are drifting apart when it comes to their work.Duncan added: “They are going off in very different directions.“If William and Kate stand for anything as a couple, as a stereotype, they are the ultimate Sloney, Barbour-wearing 'Toff' couple.“Harry and Meghan appear to be now a glitzy rock and roll star couple, who are happy to partner with the likes of Oprah Winfrey to support their good causes.“It’s more evidence of that separation in agendas between William and Harry, but they support similar causes.”PA9 Oprah was a guest at the royal wedding last may when Harry married MeghanThe royal expert pointed out that during Kate and Prince William’s first year of marriage that it was “very much the William show with Kate tagging along.”He explained: “For example they did a tour and their first tour together was in Canada, and William was showing off his flying skills by landing on a lake and the focus was so much on the future king and his future bride.“Whereas this is the Harry and the Meghan show, it’s not just about Prince Harry, so that’s something that is quite different from other royal honeymoon years.“They are starting out in a very different way.”Getty Images - Getty9 Duncan said the Queen is a 'stickler for tradition' but he doesn't think she'd ultimately be critical of the projectDespite him saying the Queen may have reservations about the project, he said Her Majesty would ultimately support the project.He said: “My understanding is that the Queen is so fond of Prince Harry that he is possibly one of the only royals who has ever managed to get the Queen to step outside her comfort zone.“I’m thinking of the message that the Queen and Harry sent to Barack Obama ahead of the Invictus Games.""The Queen making a comedy YouTube video, Harry has this bond with his grandma.“I don’t think she’d be critical. The Queen has embraced Meghan.”Duncan speculated that if the project with Oprah proves successful, there may be more celebrity collaborations with the royals on the horizon.He said: “If this is successful yes.“The word of caution for Meghan is that she remains aware that being on the carpet as a celebrity, and being on the red carpet as a royal are two fundamentally different things.“That is the danger I think.”Louis Wood - The Sun9 Duncan Larcombe said the Oprah project is evidence of Harry going along with Meghan rather than the other way aroundThe Duke of Sussex will feature in the series, which is set to focus on the importance of mental well being and inspire viewers to have honest conversations about their everyday challenges.Building on the 34-year-old's long-standing work with mental health initiatives, the documentary will enable to prince to again share his personal experience, acting as an advocate for those suffering.Previously, dad-to-be Harry admitted he had been 'very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions' throughout his childhood as he coped with his mother Diana's death.So the royal appears as the perfect choice to be the co-creator and co-producer of Apple's latest project, which seeks to empower those 'silently suffering' with depression and mental health conditions.AFP or licensors9 Oprah and Harry's documentary will be shown on Apple TV in 2020Harry said of the documentary:  ""I truly believe that good mental health – mental fitness – is the key to powerful leadership, productive communities and a purpose-driven self.""It is a huge responsibility to get this right as we bring you the facts, the science and the awareness of a subject that is so relevant during these times.""Our hope is that this series will be positive, enlightening and inclusive – sharing global stories of unparalleled human spirit fighting back from the darkest places, and the opportunity for us to understand ourselves and those around us better.""I am incredibly proud to be working alongside Oprah on this vital series which we have been developing together for several months.""-9 The Duke of Sussex has been an advocate for mental health for many years, and is personally involved with many charitiesOprah said to CBS: ""Our hope is it will have an impact on reducing the stigma and allowing people to know that they are not alone.”Harry, alongside William, 36, and Kate, 37, launched the Heads Together charity in 2016 to help people in the UK and Commonwealth to access support.And the young royals have already voiced their plans to use digital technology to “signpost” the support available to people in crisis and improve the education around mental health.This 'multi-part' TV series appeared as the perfect opportunity for the Duke of Sussex - and is currently expected to broadcast in 2020 on Apple TV.More on the royal familyTO NAME A FEW Who does the royal baby Archie share his name with & what does his name mean?

But, many of those pictured were diagnosed in their 30s.That's why The Sun launched the No Time 2 Lose campaign last year - to raise awareness and encourage everyone no matter their age to learn the signs and symptoms of the disease.Our campaign was spearheaded by Sun Online columnist Deborah James, who is photographed alongside friends in treatment, patients in remission and relatives who have lost ones.Here they tell The Sun how they represent what bowel cancer is.Sun Online columnist Deborah James, 37: 'I was 35... you're never too young'Sophie Mayanne11 Deborah was 35 when she was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancerDeborah, 37, who shares her experience in her weekly column Things Cancer Made Me Say, is being treated for stage 4 bowel cancer, said: “Bowel cancer can happen to anyone of us.""Any age, race - you are never too young, too fit or too healthy. It tears lives apart.""It's not just something that affects older people, I was 35 when I was diagnosed and my world came crashing down.""I've lost friends to this horrible disease, and I have to face the reality that it's likely to rob me of my future, my kids of their mum.""Together, by raising awareness and breaking taboos, we can stop other people dying of bowel cancer.""This disease doesn't have to be a death sentence, catch it early enough and chances are, you will survive.""Richard Bingham, 40: 'I look entirely normal but stage 4 cancer is on the rampage inside'Sophie Mayanne11 Richard Bingham was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer when he was in his 30sPhotographer's granddad had bowel cancerTHE powerful images were taken by acclaimed photographer Sophie Mayanne, whose grandfather was diagnosed with bowel cancer.She said: ""My granddad had bowel cancer in his final years, so it is a topic that hits close to home for me.""It's important to show the different angles of living with cancer - as each person's journey is as unique, as it is emotional.""I think the most important thing people can take away from these images is that life doesn't stop when you are diagnosed with cancer.""My granddad was still my granddad when he was diagnosed, as are mothers still mothers, partners still partners and family still family.”Richard Bingham, 40, from East Sussex was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in 2016.He lives in Rye with his partner Bekky (also featured in the portrait series).Since his diagnosis he has undergone bowel and liver surgery, radiotherapy and is currently having chemotherapy.He said: “Bowel cancer - indeed any cancer - is so often unseen, with the patient appearing entirely normal while the disease is on the rampage on the inside.""It comes in so many different shapes and forms that it is vital people understand this, especially to allow for early diagnosis.""The photo shoot was an amazing experience, which left both Bekky and I feeling emotional, part of a community and privileged to be involved in such an awesome and meaningful campaign.""Katy Bruce Jaja, 34: 'Pregnancy masked my disease, being young doesn't mean you're immune'Sophie Mayanne11 Katy Bruce Jaja, with her two children, said her symptoms were missed during pregnancy with her youngest son - she's just 34Katy Bruce Jaja, 34 from Essex was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer six months ago in 2018, after her symptoms were missed whilst she was pregnant with her youngest son.Katy is married and a mum of two boys.

Bowel cancer was not something that I ever thought about.""As a young woman I was aware of things like breast and cervical cancer checks but I always associated bowel cancer with being a lot older.""I’m 34. Unfortunately being young doesn’t make you immune.""More awareness needs to be raised. If you’re experiencing symptoms go to see your GP, the earlier the better!”Barbara Hibbert, 61: 'Stage 4 doesn't mean you have to stop living'Sophie Mayanne11 Former teacher Barbara Hibbert, 61 from Harrogate was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer in 2014Barbara Hibbert, 61 from Harrogate was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer in 2014.A former teacher she is a mother to two daughters and a grandmother.Barbara has undergone bowel surgery and lost her hair as a result of chemotherapy, which is quite rare for people with bowel cancer.She said: ‘‘I want to show that a stage 4, doesn’t mean that you stop living – you just have to live faster because you have less time.Bowel cancer touches millions across UK - charity bossDEBORAH Alsina, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK said: “These incredible images and raw footage are a beautiful homage to those affected by bowel cancer.""Young, old, female or male – it can affect us all.""Around 268,000 people living in the UK today have been diagnosed with bowel cancer.""But it doesn’t just impact the person with the disease.""It touches their families, friends and colleagues, doctors and nurses, scientists and researchers.""That’s millions of people right across the UK.""We need more people affected by bowel cancer to come together and take action to create a future where nobody dies of this disease.”""A terminal diagnosis isn’t a good thing to receive, but it does give you time to prepare and to make the most of the time you have left.“I put off getting my symptoms checked and that delay meant that when my cancer was found it was already severe.""It’s very easy to persuade yourself that you shouldn’t bother the busy doctor or be one of the ‘worried well’ clogging up the surgery, but it’s so important to get yourself checked, even if you are overweight, drink too much, don’t take much exercise and are menopausal – all excuses for not taking action in my case.Margaret Chung, 66: 'My daughter was 36, she died seven months after diagnosis'Sophie Mayanne11 Margaret Chung holds a picture of her daughter Annabel who died within seven months of being diagnosedMargaret Chung, 66 from Buckinghamshire lost her daughter Annabel to bowel cancer in 2016 at just 36, seven months after she was diagnosed with the disease.She said: “There isn’t a word in the dictionary that can express just how awful it was to lose Annabel.""Especially knowing that if her symptoms had been taken seriously earlier, she might still be with us.""When she was here Annabel touched so many people’s lives so knowing that through this, she has contributed and is still helping people, is a life saver for me.""I just wish she was here.”Gemma Savoury, 34: 'Bowel cancer is indiscriminate'Sophie Mayanne11 Gemma Savoury shows her permanent stoma bag after being diagnosed wit stage four bowel cancerGemma Savoury, 34, from West Midlands was initially diagnosed with stage three bowel cancer in 2014, but unfortunately three years later it spread to her lungs.Since being diagnosed she has had chemotherapy, lung surgery, abdominoperineal resection surgery and now has a permanent stoma bag and is on dialysis.She said: “It’s really important to show that anyone, at any age can be affected by bowel cancer.""Cancer doesn’t pick an age, colour or gender, it’s indiscriminate and it is life-changing.""This shoot gave me the opportunity to embrace my scars, gain some much needed confidence and feel proud of how far I’ve come.""The Sun's No Time 2 Lose campaignTHE Sun's No Time 2 Lose campaign called for bowel cancer screening in England to be lowered from 60 to 50, which experts say could save more than 4,500 lives a year.In Scotland, NHS patients can take a Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) from their 50th birthday but the rest of the UK have to wait another 10 years.An independent review of national screening programmes is currently underway, according to NHS England.But as these brave people have shown, bowel cancer can affect anyone at any age.It is the second deadliest form of the disease, but it can be cured if it's caught early - or better still prevented.Caught at stage 1 - the earliest stage - patients have a 97 per cent chance of living for five years or longer.But catch it at stage 4 - when it's already spread - and that chance plummets to just seven per cent.We all deserve an equal chance to beat this disease, regardless of where we live.We know bowel cancer is more likely after the age of 50 - so it makes sense to screen from then.Plus, it's got to save the NHS money in the long-run, catching the disease before patients need serious and expensive treatments.Reginald Bull, 84: 'I'm proof if you catch it early you can survive this'Sophie Mayanne11 Reginald Bull, 84, from Hampshire was diagnosed with stage one bowel cancer when he was 53Reginald Bull, 84, from Hampshire was diagnosed with stage one bowel cancer when he was 53.Though he was given the all clear, the fear of the cancer coming back and the trauma he went through left him with chronic depression.With the support of his wife, Maureen, Reginald sought help and is a stronger person.He said: ""Taking part made me feel that in some small way I might help others who one day may have to face all the traumas associated with being diagnosed with bowel cancer and for that I am very grateful.""Jaimin Patel, 35: 'I'm stage 3, but it doesn't mean life is over'Sophie Mayanne11 Jaimin Patel, 35, has incurable bowel cancerJaimin Patel, 35, from London was diagnosed with stage three bowel cancer in 2013 - three years later he found out it was incurable.Jaimin is married with a young son and has a stoma following bowel surgery.He said: “I want people to see that although I might be young(ish), having bowel cancer doesn’t mean that life is over.""I hope that getting the picture of normality out to those suffering with this cancer will encourage them to try different things and not feel restricted in their life.""Because if I can lead as normal a life as possible, by being positive and trying new things, you can give yourself a better chance of making the most of the time you are living and not worry about the time after.”Seraphine Uwimana, 49: 'This disease took my husband, don't let it take yours'Sophie Mayanne11 Seraphine Uwimana, 49, lost her husband, Antoine, to bowel cancer - pictured with her daughter and grandsonSeraphine Uwimana, 49 from London lost her husband, Antoine, in 2016 after he died from bowel cancer.The couple had been together for 26 years and had three children together.She said: “What I wish, is that if anyone has those symptoms then they go to the doctor as soon as they see them.""Antoine didn’t and maybe if he did, they would have caught it sooner and he would still be here now.""The thing I found hardest about losing Antoine wasn’t losing my husband, it was losing my councillor, adviser and best friend.""I don’t want anyone else to go through that.”Stuart Cock, 44: 'I want my kids to grow up in a world where no one dies from this disease'Sophie Mayanne11 Dad-of-four Stuart Cock was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2017THERE'S NO TIME 2 LOSENO TIME 2 LOSE Sharp rise in bowel cancer in under 30s prompts calls to drop screening age NEVER TOO YOUNG I was diagnosed with bowel cancer after fluke doc trip -

12,SE Dons: How grime star Don Strapzy built Sunday league team with fans from London to Papua New Guinea,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/8368570/se-dons-don-strapzy-sunday-league-football-youtube/,"28th March 2019, 9:49 am","HOW does a Sunday league football team end up with fans in Papua New Guinea, 8,996 miles away?Just ask SE Dons.Instagram/Don Strapzy8 Grime star Don Strapzy, real name Andrew McHugh, has one of the most popular and best Sunday league teams in the UK - SE Dons - but has even bigger plansBased in Lewisham, they are one of the most popular and best Sunday league teams on YouTube and current holders of the 'YouTube Championship Belt'.There are other YouTube football teams, but none quite like the Dons, who have taken a decidedly authentic approach to win hundreds of thousands of fans across the globe.The Dons, who also get hundreds of fans from around the country turn up on a Sunday morning, didn't start with intentions of being a YouTube team and were founded by McHugh and manager Ryan Palmer, just like any of the thousands of amateur teams around the country.The difference was that one of their founding members was grime star Don Strapzy, real name Andrew McHugh.Strapzy is famous for his football-based double entendres and punchlines and his music is a feature in the West Ham dressing room, thanks to Declan Rice.The England midfielder, 20, was used in a bar on 'Khabib', with Strapzy rapping: ""I'm breaking up the play, I think I'm Declan Rice.""Rice tweeted about the song in December, later revealing on West Ham's YouTube channel that if he was to put one song on in the dressing room, it would be a Don Strapzy freestyle - and then revealed even his mum is a fan.He said: ""I was actually playing it in the car with my mum, it was so funny... She don't like that type of music, she was going 'get this off, this nonsense'.""I said 'mum, just listen'... she goes 'b***** hell you're in the song - let's listen again!'""Jesse Lingard and Danny Welbeck also posted a video listening to Don Strapzy on Instagram.However, McHugh has had to graft for his success.In his early career, he had found reasonable success in music, reaching hundreds of thousands of views on his Fire in the Booth and SBTV freestyles, selling out headline shows and performing in the US.Instagram/Don Strapzy8 West Ham and England midfielder Declan Rice is a fan - and was mentioned in a lyric on the song 'Khabib'8 Ryan Fredericks answered correctly when asked what Rice likes to listen to in the West Ham dressing roomInstagram/Danny Welbeck8 Danny Welbeck also posted a video of Jesse Lingard listening and rapping along to a Don Strapzy freestyle to social mediaBut within a couple of years he was all but out of the business.His then-management convinced him to change his moniker to Dru Blu in a bid to appeal to a more commercial audience and the south Londoner eventually all but gave up on the rap game.He tells SunSport: ""I went away and sorted my life out to be honest.""Because at 22/23, I was up to no good. I didn't really have a direction of what I wanted to do, I was causing problems at home.""It was a positive transition, a heard transition as I had to change my circle of friends.""Don, whose lyrics have made reference to dealing drugs and other crime, said he ""fell into the wrong crowd"" and was ""caught up"" in other things.He would eventually start his own company coaching youth football, working in schools and running his own football camps.While focused on growing that firm, fans of his music would continue to reach out and eventually, he decided to make a return to music.McHugh needed a way to further connect with fans and began vlogging - and the football followed from there.""I saw another channel, Palmers, I was a fan of that,"" adds McHugh, who was on the books at Charlton as a kid.Instagram/Don Strapzy8 Blackburn Rovers midfielder Bradley Dack, second right, has appeared in a recent SE Dons videoInstagram/Don Strapzy8 SE Dons are currently the holders of the 'YouTube Championship Belt' played out between teams on the platform""I love Sunday League, I would always type in 'Sunday League tackles' or whatever. I liked what they were doing but I knew that my team was very different to them, the kind of characters I have in my team, you can't buy it.""Originally it wasn't something I thought of, I just brought the camera out. It went from there.""Since the football videos started in 2017, the team has seen massive growth, now boasting just shy of 100,000 subscribers, with videos regularly topping 120,000 views.In the early days, the Dons gained notoriety for being a physical team, always ready with verbals, with some YouTube comments actively cheering against the team.""At the end of the day this is our version and it's not for everyone,"" says McHugh on the criticism.""We have simmered down from our first episodes, that [comes] with growth. Toning down the rowing, trying to respect the referee more. It's Sunday league, we love it.""Strapzy believes the passion and authenticity of his team is a huge part of the appeal.""There's a story behind us, we're not clean cut,"" he says.""There are some boys on our team that have had a rough upbringing. But we all love football and we like to believe that we're not bad role models.""We can come across rowdy and stuff at games, but if you see what we're doing outside of football, we work with kids, we work with the community.Don Stapzy's football lyricsI see the game different like I'm watching it through Messi's eyesI'm breaking up the play, I think I'm Declan RiceHe aint in jail no more, he left wing, AlexisI been hard, I don't care if you got a gym pass, chest day - I'll drag man off the bench like Jose done LingardEveryday I take gambles, nothing that I won't handle, I could never switch sides, I aint Sol CampbellDon't get rude, you aint Van NistelrooyI'm Donny Jones don't dribble at me, I'll stick a foot in, elbow in the ribs when the ref aint lookingI'm blue at heart like Rooney is, I'm from where the shooters live, I might leave the ends but I'll come back to the blue like Rooney didA night out in Bridge... I'll John Terry man's wifeHe's moving like Salah until I Ramos'd himDon't get me mad again, I was touching semis before Harry Kane""We believe that sometimes in England to say 'I'm the best' or 'I want to be the best' can come across as arrogant.""But we're trying to show that no, it's OK to work hard, it's only Sunday league but it's OK to want to win, it's OK to want to be the best. We're trying to give you that passion but also to show that you have to have morals and respect.""We've got time for our supporters - I don't even like to call them fans. If we see them we say hello. If they come to the games we make them feel a part of it.""With the professional game, you've lost that connection. But they can come to meet us on a Sunday, shake our hands take pictures and we value what they've got to say as well.""Winning obviously helps and the Dons can now seriously argue to be one of the best Sunday teams in the UK.They are currently unbeaten in the Orpington & Bromley District Sunday League and have reached the final of the Kent Sunday Premier Cup - beating both of last year's finalists along the way.They've already sold 800 pre-sale tickets for the game, with hundreds more expected to turn up on the day.Half a dozen of their squad, including Palmer, play for Hythe Town, in level eight of the football pyramid and they have some real talent.Striker Zak Ansah is a former Arsenal youth team star who has played in League Two for Plymouth Argyle and Newport County.But McHugh admits he has eyes on bigger things than just being the best Sunday team around.8 Dons striker Zak Ansah, an Arsenal academy product, plays semi-pro on a Saturday and has played in League TwoFUTURE PLANS""We definitely believe that we can head to semi-pro football,"" says McHugh.""We're trying to be the best Sunday league team. But within the next five years, I want to travel, I want to take the Dons to Europe - America would be fantastic.""I have big visions, big plans, I always aim high. We've got to see where it goes really, the way it's building I don't think it's impossible.""Going into more structured football presents its own problems - stadiums have minimum requirements, the costs are much higher as are the commitments needed from players.But the Dons want a friendly with Crystal Palace in the summer and already boast sponsorship deals with Adidas and Kitlocker.As the channel grows it's not hard to see the team taking another step.On the music side, Don Strapzy also has a headline show set for the summer.Messages flood in from across the globe and merchandise is being sold worldwide - America, Australia, Papua New Guinea.Hashtag United, a wildly popular YouTube team that caters for a more PG audience, started as a Sunday league team but are now top of the Eastern Counties League Division One South, step ten in the football pyramid.An old school defensive midfielder, McHugh is currently recovering from an ACL injury and has not been able to play at all this season.Laughing, McHugh ""don't know"" if he'll be able to get back into the starting XI when he's fit - ""I'm a good footballer but there's levels!"" - but says he's ""needed"" to the team when there's a battle to be won.On a personal level, the channel has also helped him deal with personal tragedy: the death of his mother, Paula.The words 'Anything for Paula' have become a slogan for the club and a war cry for the players and fans.He says: ""You can never prepare for something like that, my mum was the heartbeat of my family.""In a weird way, it has inspired and motivated me to go harder this year and keep it consistent because that's what she would want.MOST READ IN FOOTBALLExclusivegea change Man Utd under pressure to sell David De Gea after star man rejects 'best offer' Live BlogSOL SEARCHING Get the latest updates from Old Trafford as Ole plots summer overhaul Live BlogGUNNER sign?

13,Peaky Blinders extra who was my ‘perfect fiance’ turned into a monster and beat me unconscious – but escaped jail,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/8668302/peaky-blinders-extra-who-was-my-perfect-fiance-turned-into-a-monster-and-beat-me-unconscious-but-escaped-jail/,"19th March 2019, 9:35 am","A WOMAN told how she woke up surrounded in shattered glass and not knowing where she was after being beaten up by her ex – a Peaky Blinders and Coronation street extra.Hairdresser Lyndsey Yarwood, of Melksham, Wiltshire, told Fabulous Digital what happened to her was “sad and scary”. Oliver Cox, 33, seemed like a perfect boyfriend when he started wooing Lyndsey, 35, on online dating site Plenty of Fish in early 2018.What she didn’t realise is he had actually paid just £36 to change his name and so dodge “Clare’s Law” – where people can look up the histories of boyfriends to see if they have been convicted of domestic abuse.Lyndsey told Fabulous Digital how initially her relationship with Cox, who she met after five months of chatting online, was happy.He wooed her with rose-petal baths, romantic dinners and by helping the mum-of-two with her children. On 7 October 2018, he stunned her by proposing during a trip to London.Instagram11 Cox, pictured as an extra on Peaky BlindersOverwhelmed, Lyndsey accepted and started planning their life together.""He was everything you see in rom-coms: rose-petal baths, cooking dinner, brilliant with the kids. And so believable,” she said.But their newly engaged bliss quickly soured.Ten days later Cox claimed Lyndsey’s ex had been sending him threatening messages online.It later turned out he was sending the messages to himself from a fake Instagram account.Then on 19 November 2018, they hosted an engagement party with pals.But after going home, Lyndsey woke in the middle of the night with Cox right next to her “looking angry”.Instagram11 Cox, pictured on the set of Coronation StreetInstagram11 He admitted that he took steroidsShe explained: “He grabbed my wrist and started accusing me of cheating on him.  He was going through my phone and calling me a slag.”He then smashed up his phone, prompting Lyndsey to go to bed in tears.But the next morning he claimed he couldn’t remember anything from the night before and just said: “Oh my god, I’m so sorry”.Believing he was genuine, Lyndsey agreed to forget it.But on 8 December 2018, Lyndsey received a worrying message on Facebook from Cox’s ex-girlfriend who urged her to “look into his past”.She was aware of Clare’s Law and contacted Wiltshire Police and asked them to run a search on him.She was relieved to be told there was nothing of concern in his past and put the message down to his ex being a jilted love rival.Kennedy News and Media11 Lyndsey spoke of her horror after being attackedThen, while celebrating his birthday in December 2018, they argued on a night out, with Cox accusing her of “ruining my birthday”.When they got back to the hotel he grabbed her and punched her in the face, leaving her with two black eyes and bruises to her body.Lyndsey said: ""I woke up in a completely different area of the room facing the window and I looked around. There was glass everywhere, just shattered glass all over the place.""I don't know how long I'd been unconscious for.“I start packing the bags, I got changed out of my night clothes and I said 'I'm going home' but he followed me.“I drove the car to the main part of the car park and stopped.""I said 'I'm not going anywhere with you'. He jumped out of the car, came round to the other side then punched me in the jaw twice. Then he bundled me over to the passenger side.Instagram11 Cox, pictured training with Ricky HattonInstagram11 Steroid-addled Cox repeatedly changed his name""He said 'if I can't be with you I might as well end it now'. I just kept quiet.""He stopped at the garage and got me a cold pack of bacon to put on my bruise.""I was hoping he was faking his threats for attention but I had it in my mind that he could possibly kill us. I was thinking 'oh my god, the kids are going to have no mum'.”The next day, Lyndsey decided enough was enough and fled to her mum's.Lyndsey reported Cox to Wiltshire Police for his violence and later learned he had changed his name by deed poll to Bartholomew Milben.And sickeningly, five days prior to attacking Lyndsey, brute Cox had even shared a post on Facebook praising Clare's Law as something that not only helps women but can “defend men who have been labelled”.I woke up in a completely different area of the room facing the window and I looked around. There was glass everywhere, just shattered glass all over the place.Lyndsey Yarwood35On 27 February he admitted assault by occasioning actual bodily harm after attacking the single mum but walked free from court with an 18-week suspended sentence.Cox, of Portsmouth, was given a two-year restraining order from contacting Lyndsey and ordered to pay her £725 compensation, £115 victim surcharge and £85 court costs.He blamed his behaviour on his use of steroids but claimed he was “not a monster”.Lyndsey blasted: “I’m pretty sure it’s going to take for him to actually kill someone for the courts to punish him properly.“No wonder women don’t go through with pressing charges for domestic violence.""He was given a restraining order, but there's nothing to stop him standing outside my house as long as he doesn't contact me.""Lyndsey decided to speak out to call for a change in the law to ensure that anyone who changes their name by deed poll remains linked to the previous moniker.Kennedy News and Media11 Lyndsey was heartbroken when she was attackedKennedy News and Media11 Lyndsey shows off damage to her neckShe said: ""I've no idea why he didn't come up on Clare's Law. He managed to get through somehow.""The amount of phone calls I had to make was unbelievable.“I think with Clare's Law, every single recorded name needs to be linked to the same person.""It costs £36 to change your name by deed poll. There needs to be a register for offenders that people can just go on.“The hardest thing for women in this situation is you think with your heart.“I just pray the next victim doesn’t fall for his conman ways his sob stories. I hope enough people see his face and see what he’s capable of.""She believes Cox slipped through the net because he repeatedly changes his name - previously calling himself Darren Berry, Bart Milben and other variations of these.""Who were Cox's other victims?The year before attacking Lyndsey, Cox was found guilty of assault by beating and given 100 hours of community service, a rehabilitation course and a restraining order preventing him from contacting ex-girlfriend Rosie Benson.Rosie met Cox on Facebook in 2016 but after dating him for 18 months they broke up - however she says he continued to turn up at her house.She claims she would find him sleeping in her outside toilet building or in his car and he even faked seizures for sympathy.Rosie, from Bolton, Lancashire, said: ""It's been hell. He'd knocked on my door after punching himself in the face to say he'd been attacked round the corner.""I would think 'how many times can you be attacked around the corner?' We didn't live in a bad area at all.""Jen Atherton considers herself one of the 'lucky ones' as she was not attacked by Cox - though Merseyside Police still told him to stop any further contact with her.Jen, from Wirral, Merseyside, said: ""On Facebook when I was talking to him he was Bart Milben.""He had an empty scrapbook for us to put our memories in for the future, and a Beauty and the Beast-style rose. I'd only been speaking to him for a week.""Two days later, he came to my house with a big bunch of flowers.""We were watching TV and he made a few snide comments that I hadn't taken a picture of the flowers and posted them on social media.""I could see he was messaging girls and I said 'you're having a go at me about not posting the pictures of flowers - you're messaging girls?'""He went mental. He was stomping round the house, shouting. He said he was going to kill himself.""Even after they broke up, Cox would not leave her alone and she was forced to contact the police.Jen said: ""He was giving me s*** for about two weeks. I called the police. They [told him he was not to contact me].""A Wiltshire Police spokeswoman said: “This case has been referred to our Professional Standards Department and a review is currently ongoing to determine what happened in this case and why a disclosure was not made. “Due to this investigation, it would be inappropriate to comment further.”When contacted for comment, Cox said: “I changed my name to Bartholomew by deed poll.""It was for a fresh start and a sign of a new me, but I did it at a time when I was very confused about myself.""What happened that night is disgusting and shouldn't have happened. It ruined what could have been a brilliant relationship.""I ain't a monster. I've had some serious problems unfortunately, when I've had a drug addiction and took steroids.Kennedy News and Media11 Rosie Benson was another target of Cox'sKennedy News and Media11 He also charmed Jen Atherton - she's pictured with him here""Unfortunately because I had a mental health problem you're adding to a chemical imbalance in your brain.""There's people out [there] and women that get into certain situations.""What I want to gain from this now is help women in this situation and also help males who have mental health [issues] and don't know how to handle relationships.""I've admitted my wrongs, I'm not hiding away from that and I want to do things to help other people in the future.""I'm not condoning what happened that night with me and Lyndsey - I hate it. I'm mortified by it and I cry every day.“I have accepted responsibility for what has happened.”What is Clare's Law?Wiltshire Police is conducting an internal review into how it handled Lyndsey’s “Clare’s Law” request - which is named after Clare Woods, 36, who was murdered by her boyfriend George Appleton in Salford, Gtr Manchester, in 2009.Her dad Michael Brown campaigned for the introduction of Clare's Law, arguing her death would have been prevented had she known her partner's history.In 2014 the law - knowns as the Domestic Violence Closure Scheme - was passed, allowing police to disclose information on request about a partner's previous history of domestic violence or violent acts.Greater Manchester Police11 Clare Wood who was killed by a man she met on FacebookMost read in Real LifeExclusivescarred for life My jealous 20-stone boyfriend ripped my tongue out with his bare hands crime and nunishment I became a drug dealing nun after my bigamist husband stole my cash MATRI-MOANY Fury at bridezilla who wants to BAN fiancé's 'crotch goblin' child from wedding WATER FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH Mum says drinking only water for 3 WEEKS is the key to young looks BURIED ALIVE I've hoarded so much stuff I couldn’t get to the toilet or clean my cat's poo ExclusiveBRIT HARSH!

All Rights Reserved.4 Elvira was trafficked from Qatar into the UK and forced to work as a domestic servantThere are 136,000 people - about the same number of people who live in Blackpool - being held as slaves in the UK.Not only are we letting down those working as slaves, we're letting down those who manage to escape the clutches of their captors, as it is estimated that up to 34 per cent of victims of modern slavery are re-trafficked.This is because they are left without enough support from the government – meaning they are vulnerable and easy targets.These people live amongst us unnoticed - washing our cars, painting our nails and working as domestic slaves in houses on our streets.Our current laws don't go far enough to protect victims of slavery.4 Sandu was tragically electrocuted and killed in the squalid flat he shared with other car wash workersThey only have 45 days government support - including financial, housing and medical assistance - but this is simply not enough time to recover from the mental and physical abuse they have suffered.Having heard at first hand the harrowing stories of people like Ali who have been caught up in this heinous crime, I am proud that we are working to support and help rebuild their lives.This is why the Co-op are backing the Sun's Stamp Out Slavery campaign - which calls to change the amount of time victims are allowed to remain in the UK - because we desperately need to provide a safety net to protect these people.In this vital campaign, we've met Elvira who was forced to work for 20 hours a day for her slave masters.She, like Brenda, who came over to the UK to send money back to her family in Asia, but was forced to cook and clean for no pay.Forced to work in a car wash for EIGHT MONTHS, Joe's story as told to the Sun OnlineWe have seen how others, trafficked in by eastern European or Russian gangs, are forced to work as manual labourers - often in cheap car washes, some which are unsafe, risking illnesses from chemicals and even death.This was the case for Sandu, who was tragically electrocuted and killed in the flat he shared with five other workers behind the car-washing site they worked at for 12 hours a day.Fiona Hanson © 20194 Domestic slaves like Brenda are forced to cook and clean for little or no moneyPut simply, modern slavery shames Britain. Our nation has a rich history of anti-slavery.If we allow it to continue then we are failing those who fought for our country and going back on our heritage.The Sun wants to Stamp out SlaverySlavery takes a variety of forms, but most commonly forced labour, sexual exploitation, domestic work or forced criminal activity. The Home Office estimated that there are 13,000 people held in slavery in the UK, with the Global Slavery Index suggesting the figure could be as many as 136,000.The UK recognised a staggering 5,145 victims from 116 countries in 2017, including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.At present, trafficked victims have just 45 days support after being freed before they are expected to leave the UK and are deported by the Home Office.During this short time, they are given accommodation, financial aid, medical treatment, counselling, a support worker, a translator and legal advice.We want the government to: Back Lord McColl's proposed bill, which suggests all victims of modern slavery should be given a year's support to recover.Alongside that they should be given special support to help them, including housing benefits, financial help and other services.Victims are men and women, boys and girls, UK nationals and non-UK nationals, and it is happening throughout communities across the UK.Without realising it, we can all be interacting with victims on a daily basis. Where we suspect it, we must report it to the Modern Slavery Helpline.As a country we have made substantial progress to combat modern slavery but we cannot stand still.Business, government and society all have a part to play to consign modern slavery to the history books.Thankfully, Ali, the man I met at that car wash escaped to a safe house where he was referred to Bright Future, the Co-op’s pathway to employment for victims of slavery.Supported by the charity City Hearts, he was able to rebuild his life with a four week work placement and a job offer at the Co-op at the end of it.HELP STAMP OUT SLAVERYWant to help? Here are some of the possible warning signs to look for, according to the Modern Slavery Helpline:Domestic slaves may be held in their employer's home and forced to carry out tasks such as childcare, cooking and cleaningThey may not be allowed to leave the house on their own, or they may be monitoredThe person may work long working hoursThey may not have access to their own belongings, such as a mobile phone or their own IDThe employer may be abusive, both physically and verballyThe person may not interact often with the family they are employed byA domestic slave may be deprived of their own personal living space, food, water or medical careThey may wear poorer quality clothing compared to other family membersSuspicious? You can call the Modern Slavery Helpline on 08000 121 700, or fill in an online report at: www.modernslaveryhelpline.org/reportAlthough Ali is now living happily in the UK, many others are not so fortunate.In 2017 the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee noted the “inexcusable” lack of government support for victims of modern slavery.Latest News:GAS ATROCITY FEARS US warns Syria it WILL respond after 'signs' of deadly chemical attack FARAGE CASH PROBE EU to investigate Nigel Farage over £450,000 donation from Arron Banks BAD BUS-INESS Poorer Brits 'giving up jobs or college places due to cuts in bus services' CommentTHE SUN SAYS PM's desperate Brexit capitulation achieved nothing but alienating everyone HAMM SLAM Philip Hammond sparks uproar from Brexiteers in rant over consequences of No Deal CARE CAP CALL Dominic Raab will put £100k lifetime cap on OAP care costs if he becomes PM This can’t continue.  Without appropriate support for victims, including a right to remain in the UK for those that are not UK nationals, they stand little chance of rebuilding their lives and risk falling back into abuse.Victims need time to recover – that’s why The Sun and The Co-op are calling on the Prime Minister to provide 12 months of guaranteed support for victims through the Victim Support Bill."

It was posted on a Facebook page belonging to Brenton TarrantThree men and one woman are now in custody.It was originally reported one of the people arrested were wearing a suicide vest, but that theory has now been discounted by police.The graphic footage of the attack and manifesto were published on the Facebook account of Brenton Tarrant. His profile has since been removed.The names of the gunmen have not yet been confirmed by police.When writing why he carried out the evil massacre, the shooter said: ""To take revenge on the invaders for the hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by foreign invaders in European lands throughout history.""By the definition, then yes. It is a terrorist attack. But I believe it is a partisan action against an occupying force.""10'BY DEFINITION IT'S A TERRORIST ATTACK'He boasted that he chose to use firearms so he could influence politics in the US.He wrote that he wanted to ""create conflict between the two ideologies within the United States on the ownership of firearms in order to further the social, cultural, political and racial divide"".And he ranted about his hopes that “this conflict over the 2nd amendment and the attempted removal of firearms rights will ultimately result in a civil war that will eventually balkanize the US along political, cultural and, most importantly, racial lines.”The suspected shooter described himself as an ""ordinary white man born in Australia to a working class, low income family.""He wrote: ""My parents are of Scottish, Irish and English stock. I had a regular childhood, without any great issues.""He said he had ""little interest in education"" and ""did not attend University as I had no great interest in anything offered in the Universities to study.""I am just a regular white man, from a regular family. Who decided to take a stand to ensure a future for my people.""In footage too distressing to show, the gunman executes people at point blank range – including one girl who lies on the floor screaming for help.The man, who was dressed in military clothing, was even seen re-entering the mosque and shooting piles of groaning bodies.Two gunmen attacked Masjid Al Noor Mosque in Christchurch and the Linwood Masjid at around 1.40pm on Friday.10 A gunman has opened fire at a mosque in New Zealand killing multiple people.

22,It’s our duty as MPs to vote for Theresa May’s Brexit deal — it’s the only reasonable option,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8549047/robert-halfon-pms-deal-only-reasonable-option/,"3rd March 2019, 12:43 am","OK, I hold my hands up. I voted Remain in 2016.But once the votes were cast and the clear result was Leave, I knew it was my duty as an MP to follow the people’s instruction. It was Parliament’s duty to do that.Getty2 I voted against Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement in January as it seemed designed to keep Britain in a dark treacle of EU bureaucracy, but this time it seems to be the only reasonable optionThe Conservative manifesto on which we were elected in 2017 contained a commitment to leave the EU and I have followed that commitment, voting for Article 50 and opposing a second referendum.Remaining true to that democratic commitment is also the reason I voted against Mrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement in January. That deal seemed designed to keep Britain in a dark treacle of EU bureaucracy.It established a separation between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. And it presented hard-pressed taxpayers with a £39billion bill — for the privilege of this divisive and never-ending backstop.THE BEST OPTIONNow, with the Brexit clock ticking perilously close to midnight, I have decided to vote FOR the deal Theresa May will soon bring back to Parliament.I do not believe there is any betrayal in my decision. It is one, I believe, that will be shared by many of the MPs who also voted down the deal just weeks ago.No Deal would be disastrous for the UK and Europe. Big businesses would survive but many of the UK’s hundreds of thousands of small businesses would not. They are the backbone of our successful economy.We have an overriding duty as Conservatives to protect them and the jobs they provide from No Deal.I am in no doubt that the public are increasingly anxious about the catastrophic consequences of No Deal. This week, a waitress in my constituency asked me whether, post-Brexit, her family would be able to pay their household bills.We must protect jobs and business from No Deal catastrophe.It was one of countless similar conversations among individuals, families and their communities.Many are terrified about their futures and their country’s. It is our duty as politicians to act and speak responsibly to calm such fears.None of this means those who voted to leave Brussels have changed their minds. They want a Brexit which works for everyone and which does not needlessly risk jobs and living standards.Should Brexit not happen, voters will feel cheated and disenfranchised by Parliamentary manoeuvres which frustrate the Referendum and keep the UK in the EU.Such an outcome would spark a political crisis, potential civil unrest and political extremism, which has no place in British politics. MPs know that if they again vote down the PM’s deal, with any positive changes it may contain, they will hugely increase the likelihood of Britain remaining in the EU.WE CANNOT BETRAY DEMOCRACYOf course, most reasonable people will accept a postponement of a few weeks to the March 29 Brexit date.But it seems far more likely that any delay to Article 50 would be much longer.This would give time for the Remainers to force through a Second Referendum — based on a fudged question denying voters the clear-cut choice on which they voted in 2016.So I believe a vote for the Prime Minister’s deal is now the only responsible option.No deal risks economic chaos and plummeting living standards. Opening the door to remaining in the EU, or having another vote, will cause an unprecedented political crisis.I believe our future relationship with Europe should involve Britain becoming part of Common Market 2.0.Any delay to Article 50 would give time for the Remainers to force through a Second Referendum.This would mean our joining the European Free Trade Association alongside successful countries such as Norway and Switzerland. The UK would be out of the EU, out of the political union, the ECJ, the Common Fisheries and Farming Policies.We would have brakes on freedom of movement and much more. But as EFTA members we would be part of the European Economic Area, safeguarding our businesses and jobs.That though is for the next round of negotiations during the necessary transition period which will follow Brexit Day.MOST READ IN OPINIONCommentJANE MOORE Time for something completely different…let's put the boot in at EU elections CommentDAMIAN GREEN How Tory leadership race can lead to every Brit having a shot at the good life CommentALLY ROSS Graham Norton shouldn't have spared Madge's blushes as he lashed Eurovision acts CommentTHE SUN SAYS PM's desperate Brexit capitulation achieved nothing but alienating everyone CommentTHE SUN SAYS Hipster who threw MILKSHAKE achieved nothing but to recruit more Farage fans CommentNICK TIMOTHY Tinderbox Tories will get burned at the ballots - they need a new plan In the meantime, it is our responsibility as MPs and democrats to make sure we exit the EU on the terms of the deal which the PM brings back to Parliament.Voting it down a second time will leave us all facing the stark choice of either the economic disaster of a no deal, or the political disaster of a Second Referendum.Either option would be a betrayal of democracy for which the political classes would be damned by voters with devastating consequences.Robert Halfon is MP for Harlow, former skills minister and he chairs the Commons education committee.Alamy Live News2 If we vote it down a second time we will face the stark choice of a No Deal catastrophe or the political disaster of a Second ReferendumPM Theresa May said Article 50 could be delayed as she outlined plans for Brexit meaningful votes GOT a story?

23,Geoffrey Cox warns EU chiefs ‘the future of Europe is in both our hands’ as 75 per cent of voters blame bickering MPs for Brexit chaos,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8548892/geoffrey-cox-eu-chiefs-warning/,"3rd March 2019, 12:04 am","BREXIT broker Geoffrey Cox has cranked up the pressure on EU chiefs by warning them: “The future of Europe is in both our hands.”The dogged law chief has held nothing back in his bid to clinch a last-gasp deal that will win the backing of MPs.Rex Features5 Geoffrey Cox has warned EU chief Michel Barnier that failure to deliver a clean departure would have devastating consequences for the whole continentHe bluntly told chief Brussels negotiator Michel Barnier failure to deliver a clean departure would have devastating consequences for the whole continent.His straight-talking seemed to be paying off as Brussels gave the clearest sign yet of a willingness to break the deadlock.He signalled Brussels is ready to give Britain further “guarantees, assurances and clarifications” the hated Irish backstop will only be temporary.With 26 days to go to Brexit, it raised a glimmer of hope Mr Cox could return with a deal in time to avoid a damaging delay to our departure date.The revelation came as an exclusive Sun on Sunday poll revealed two in five voters would find any postponement unacceptable. Three in four blame bickering MPs for the Brexit chaos and many say MPs trying to thwart the process are a “complete and utter disgrace”.Brexiteer Mr Cox, dubbed Mufasa after the Lion King character by fellow ministers because of his booming voice, spent most of last week locked in talks with Mr Barnier.IT'S IN OUR HANDSDuring a brief return to London, the Attorney General told pals both sides were fully aware of the consequences of failure.A Tory source said: “Geoffrey said he keeps hammering home the message that intransigence will be the road to disaster for both Britain and the EU.“He said he had told Michel Barnier the future not only of the UK but the whole of Europe was in their hands and they had to find a way to end the stalemate for the sake of many millions of people.”In a sign that talks were going amicably, Mr Cox also revealed: “It’s all done in a friendly but business-like manner. They are not monsters.”Mr Cox is trying to find a legally-binding solution to ease Brexiteer fears that the backstop is a trap to keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely.'THE EU'S NEGOTIATORS ARE NOT MONSTERS'In an interview with German newspaper Die Welt yesterday, Mr Barnier said: “We know there are misgivings in Britain that the backstop could keep Britain forever connected to the EU.“This is not the case. And we are ready to give further guarantees, assurances and clarifications that the backstop should only be temporary.”If the pair break the deadlock, Theresa May could bring her deal back to the Commons before the scheduled date on March 12.Allies of the PM say there are signs that hardline Eurosceptics may now be willing to rally behind it to avoid the threat of Brexit-wrecking MPs voting down a No Deal Brexit and opting for a delay which could pave the way for a second referendum.5 5But even if the deal goes through, a “technical extension” of up to two months may be needed to pass all the legislation required for withdrawal.Mrs May has said that if her deal is rejected by Parliament, MPs will be able to vote on whether the UK can leave in a No Deal scenario, and if that is rejected, the Commons can decide on whether to extend Article 50 and delay Brexit for a limited period.Most people believe Mrs May’s decision to give Brexit-wrecking MPs the chance to vote for a delay is a “complete and utter betrayal”, according to a OnePoll survey for The Sun on Sunday.Some 26 per cent say the PM should deliver Brexit on time as promised, even if it means leaving without a deal.Only 17 per cent believe a short delay of two or three months is acceptable — but only if she is able to improve her deal. And 13 per cent think a delay is a ploy to prolong the process for a second referendum or another way of keeping Britain in the EU.Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit-backing group Change Britain, said: “These MPs are not only frustrating the votes of 17.4million people, they’re also betraying the wishes of their own constituents.MOST READ IN BREXITExclusiveULTIMAYTE BETRAYAL Theresa May faces new coup after second EU referendum gamble backfires BETRAYAL May caves in to Labour & promises MPs vote on 2nd ref in final bid to save deal CommentLEO MCKINSTRY Farage hit by milkshake is a joke to the left - but he'll have the last laugh ExclusiveSTOP-BREXIT SWING Lib Dems will 'top Labour in Euro polls because of Corbyn’s Brexit fudge' BREX APPEAL Brexit Party set to win more support than every Remain party put together HOW DARE EU Chief Eurocrat Donald Tusk meddles in British politics backing pro-EU Change UK ""A politician’s job is to represent the views of voters, not to ignore them because they think the public got it wrong.”MPs’ handling of the process is described as a “complete and utter disgrace” by 46 per cent of voters and a further 29 per cent say most of them don’t believe in Brexit and are trying to frustrate the referendum result.Only 11 per cent believe MPs are doing their best in difficult circumstances.EPA5 Nearly a quarter of voters polled described Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark as 'disloyal and disgraceful'EPA5 Some 26 per cent said the PM should deliver Brexit on time as promised, even if it means leaving without a deal'It's our duty to vote for PM's deal and protect jobs and businesses from No Deal catastrophe'By Robert Halfron, MP for Harlow, former skills minister and chair of the Commons education committeeOK, I hold my hands up. I voted Remain in 2016.But once the votes were cast and the clear result was Leave, I knew it was my duty as an MP to follow the people’s instruction. It was Parliament’s duty to do that.The Conservative manifesto on which we were elected in 2017 contained a commitment to leave the EU and I have followed that commitment, voting for Article 50 and opposing a second referendum.Remaining true to that democratic commitment is also the reason I voted against Mrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement in January. That deal seemed designed to keep Britain in a dark treacle of EU bureaucracy.It established a separation between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. And it presented hard-pressed taxpayers with a £39billion bill — for the privilege of this divisive and never-ending backstop.Now, with the Brexit clock ticking perilously close to midnight, I have decided to vote FOR the deal Theresa May will soon bring back to Parliament.I do not believe there is any betrayal in my decision. It is one, I believe, that will be shared by many of the MPs who also voted down the deal just weeks ago.No Deal would be disastrous for the UK and Europe. Big businesses would survive but many of the UK’s hundreds of thousands of small businesses would not.They are the backbone of our successful economy. We have an overriding duty as Conservatives to protect them and the jobs they provide from No Deal.I am in no doubt that the public are increasingly anxious about the catastrophic consequences of No Deal. This week, a waitress in my constituency asked me whether, post-Brexit, her family would be able to pay their household bills.It was one of countless similar conversations among individuals, families and their communities.Many are terrified about their futures and their country’s. It is our duty as politicians to act and speak responsibly to calm such fears.None of this means those who voted to leave Brussels have changed their minds. They want a Brexit which works for everyone and which does not needlessly risk jobs and living standards.Should Brexit not happen, voters will feel cheated and disenfran- chised by Parliamentary manoeuvres which frustrate the Referendum and keep the UK in the EU.Such an outcome would spark a political crisis, potential civil unrest and political extremism, which has no place in British politics.MPs know that if they again vote down the PM’s deal, with any positive changes it may contain, they will hugely increase the likelihood of Britain remaining in the EU.Of course, most reasonable people will accept a postponement of a few weeks to the March 29 Brexit date.But it seems far more likely that any delay to Article 50 would be much longer.This would give time for the Remainers to force through a Second Referendum — based on a fudged question denying voters the clear-cut choice on which they voted in 2016.So I believe a vote for the Prime Minister’s deal is now the only responsible option.The alternatives are horrendous.No deal risks economic chaos and plummeting living standards. Opening the door to remaining in the EU, or having another vote, will cause an unprecedented political crisis.I believe our future relationship with Europe should involve Britain becoming part of Common Market 2.0.This would mean our joining the European Free Trade Association alongside successful countries such as Norway and Switzer- land.The UK would be out of the EU, out of the political union, the ECJ, the Common Fisheries and Farming Policies. We would have brakes on freedom of movement and much more.But as EFTA members we would be part of the European Economic Area, safeguarding our businesses and jobs.That though is for the next round of negotiations during the necessary transition period which will follow Brexit Day.In the meantime, it is our responsibility as MPs and democrats to make sure we exit the EU on the terms of the deal which the PM brings back to Parliament.Voting it down a second time will leave us all facing the stark choice of either the economic disaster of a no deal, or the political disaster of a Second Referendum.Either option would be a betrayal of democracy for which the political classes would be damned by voters with devastating consequences.Delaying Brexit a 'mistake' and risks BETRAYING public, says PM's aide Nadhim Zahawi MPGOT a story?

I eventually moved into a family hostel, for which I had to pay £90 a month. It seemed like a fortune,” Jem, who is now mum to Rufus, three, told The Sun.“It was a brutal time. I remember a heroin addict once knocked at my door, when I was living in the hostel. She blamed me for stealing something from her. It was a pretty scary environment to live in, but I was fine most days.”Fortunately, Jem’s grandparents, who moved away to Hartlepool three months after she was thrown out from home, came back to Harrogate and took her in when she was 19.�Andrew McCaren11 Indieworx Collective is a co-working space in Harrogate, which offers permanent desk space and hotdesking for freelancers in the area�Andrew McCaren11 Indieworx members pay £18 a day or £220 a month - which includes unlimited free tea and coffee.�Andrew McCaren11 Jem suffered from PTSD for several years after living on the streets but her drive to learn and succeed helped her to power through difficult timesBut despite having a roof over her head, Jem didn’t really know what to do with her life.She went from a spell as a hairdresser to being an apprentice painter and decorator before being signed off sick with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - an anxiety disorder caused by stressful, frightening or distressing events - that she developed from living on the streets.During this time she lived on disability benefits and also had some support from her grandparents.�Andrew McCaren11 Jem started her new venture with a £25,000 loan repayable over five years from the Government-backed Start-Up Loans Company©Andrew McCaren11 The firm offers up to 25 formal desks on a flexible basis as well as a meeting room to seat eight peopleJem's tip for budding entrepreneursJEM went from being homeless at 16 to running two businesses. Here are her tips:Do not give up: There will be setbacks but there’s always a light at the end of tunnel. Whether you’re struggling with money, or you’re stressed about how slow things are going, just remember – things do get better.Keep learning: This is not the time to rest on the laurels of the qualifications you have already gained. Think of how you can improve your business and the new skills you can learn.Make good use of your contacts: Good communication is an important part of any business. Speak to people around you. Fantastic relationships within the industry will help your business grow.Commit: I used social media to announce that I was starting Indieworx. This meant I felt an obligation to actually achieve it; I didn’t want to let anyone down.Committing and talking about it with your family is a good technique to stick to your deadlines.She said: “I don’t suffer from PTSD today but at the time I had severe anxiety which made it tough to hold a job but I didn’t want to waste my time.“I always loved books, learning and writing so from the age of 19 to 25, I took out a student loan and did three degrees - a foundation degree in Visual Arts at Harrogate College, a BA in English Literature and an MA in Creative Writing at York St John University.”Jem then got a job as a tech copywriter, which she did for two years, before setting up her own copywriting business - Weasel Words in 2013.‘In London co-working spaces are booming - I want the same for Harrogate’The mum-of-one was inspired to launch Indieworx Collective - one of the city's first co-working spaces - after reading Harrogate council’s economic growth strategy plan.It aims to support small start-ups and create a sense of community for lonely freelancers who would otherwise be working from home or out of coffee shops.She said: “I was born in Harrogate and I love this city so I was always interested in knowing about the new projects in town.“The document highlighted a lot of positive things about Harrogate. For example, that we have a lot of start-ups and an educated population but equally that these people work elsewhere because there’s a lack of opportunity.©Andrew McCaren11 The building also has a 50″ screen for presentations or workshops and high speed WiFi.©Andrew McCaren11 With Indieworx, Jem is hoping to create a sense of community and also address the issue of isolation for people who work for themselves at home.""I wanted to change that. I could see there was a gap for a project like Indieworx Collective and I thought ‘let’s do it’.”While setting up her new company Jem continued running her copywriting business which only convinced her that places like Indieworx are needed.She said: “I worked from home for six years and I was getting fed up with only talking to the goldfish. I wanted to help other freelancers like me by creating a sense of community and also address the issue of isolation for people who work for themselves at home.”Jem started her new venture with a £25,000 loan repayable over five years from the government-backed Start-Up Loans Company, which offers a 6 per cent fixed rate on borrowing up to £25,000, and now business is picking up.After just three months in business, Indieworx is becoming part of the Harrogate landscape with the company predicted to turn over £100,000 this financial year.How to get a start-up business loanIF you need financial support in setting up your business, you can get loans of up to £25,000 to help along the way.Virgin StartUP offers government-backed loans from £500 to £25,000 to help entrepreneurs launching or growing a business that’s under two-years-old in England or Scotland. It has a rate of 6 per cent interest.The Start-Up Loans Company, which lends government subsidised loans up to £25,000 at a rate of 6 per cent.The Princes Trust also offers loans, up to £5,000, at a rate of 6.2 per cent.The firm offers up to 25 formal desks on a flexible basis as well as a meeting room to seat eight people, a kitchen area and a cluster of comfy sofas, in offices created from a former carpet showroom.Jem did some research and took out a three year lease on the building just outside Harrogate town centre and pays £42,000 in rent a year - although this was reduced by £10,000 in the first year.Indieworx members pay £18 a day or £220 a month - which includes unlimited free tea and coffee.The building also has a 50″ screen for presentations or workshops and high speed WiFi.Jem said: “In London, co-working spaces like Indieworx are booming. But in Harrogate we see roads packed with professionals heading out of of the city to go somewhere else. I want them to stay here by offering them a cheap and cheerful environment where they can work, meet other people and share their knowledge.”�Andrew McCaren11 These days, Indieworx has 40 regular members and one full-time employee©Andrew McCaren11 Jem said the most difficult part about being a business owner is to never be able to switch offThese days, Indieworx has 41 regular members and one full-time employee paid £13,200 a year, who helps Jem with running day-to-day operations and offers business advice.For now, the mum-of-one doesn’t take any money out of the business herself to make sure as much cash as possible is kept in the company.In addition to providing a co-working space, Indieworx also has a programme of regular workshops and events aimed at freelancers and start-ups to allow people to meet, chat, share problems and find solutions to their common struggles as young business owners.These are usually run in collaboration with local organisations and universitiesJem said: “We’ve got a great mix of people from children’s book authors to garden designers and young entrepreneurs. The last thing I wanted was to create a sales environment for established businesses. We want people to help each other and grow together.”As a parent, running her own business has also given Jem the flexibility to look after her son at the same time. She said “Running my own business also gives me a lot of flexibility particularly as a parent and I feel very grateful for it.“But the most difficult day-to-day part is to never be able to switch off. That’s something I am still working on.”�Andrew McCaren11 The mum-of-one is particularly excited about transforming Indieworx into an education hub this yearMy first proposal was turned down by the council but I didn't let it stop meOf course, setting up a business also has other drawbacks. Jem confessed: “There have been so many challenges to get the business to open open. From the council turning down our original proposal for the offices to the planning process taking three months instead of six weeks, costing us three months in rent and bills needlessly.”Jem also lost an anticipated grant funding of £12,500 in September through the Ad:Venture programme - which provides business support to young companies with an ambition to grow.She said: “It was devastating. The grant money we've lost was my working capital to get us to the point where the members of the space paid for the cost of the rent and bills. We've downsized the plans and thankfully had a number of donations of furniture and art which meant we were ready to open on time.“The day I was told we wouldn’t get the funding I also got four enquiries from businesses to hire out the space. So it felt a bit like a Hollywood movie - when everything goes horribly wrong before being great again:”EASY MONEY How to make money from home – earn up to £1,000 without leaving your sofa‘Going from homeless at the age of 16 to running two successful businesses at 33 is my proudest achievement’Looking to the future, Jem is particularly excited about transforming Indieworx into an education hub this year. She is working on implementing a teaching programme about business for start-ups, coding clubs for teenagers and back-to-work coaching for young mums. But she has no immediate plans to open a new venue.She said: “Let's see how this one goes first! I'd love to do similar projects across the region but each one will take someone like me to make it be a success - someone that loves their town and wants it to be a better place.“More about starting your own businessSTEP UP Meet the 17-year-old school dropout who makes £20,000 selling customised trainers APPY DAYS How a student turned his part-time job as a teacher into a £1m tutoring app FLAMING BRILLIANT Meet the 14-year-old making THOUSANDS from a candle and homeware business A CUT ABOVE Husband and wife launch their own shampoo and turn it into a £5M business LEG-UP Mum's deadly 'ticking time-bomb' condition inspired £250k sexy lingerie brand MONEY MAKER Property tycoon, 28, learned how to make millions by watching YouTube videos And she feels that even in its infancy the business is still a huge achievement given where she started from. “Going from homeless at the age of 16 to running two successful businesses at 33 is my proudest achievement and I know there are more good ones to come.”Last week, The Sun chatted with a 26-year-old entrepreneur who grew up on a council estate but now runs a ticket company worth £22million.Earlier this month we revealed how this mum-of-two turned painful bunions into a £250,000 shoe business after getting laid off while pregnant.In December, we spoke to a young lad about how he started a million-pound video business with just £50 after his parents lost £150,000 in the Northern Rock crisis.Former nurse swapped bandages for clippers after launching spa for dogs and it's on target to make to make £85,000 this yearWe pay for your stories!

We put down a £12,000 deposit which worked out at around 5 per cent of the purchase price, and took out a £46,000 Help to Buy loan.We then took out a mortgage for the remainder – a five-year fixed-rate with Leeds Building Society at 2.59 per cent over a term of 30 years.Our monthly mortgage repayments are currently £625, which is around £100 more than what I was paying in rent.We found this deal through a financial adviser, but we didn’t have to pay her as she took her commission from the lender.SWNS:South West News Service12 The couple managed to save £600 on furniture and setting up utilities by shopping through cashback sitesSWNS:South West News Service12 Downstairs, there’s a large lounge/diner, kitchen and a toiletHow did you save for the deposit?Before meeting Jamie, I worked quite a few weekend shifts on top of my usual Monday to Friday job in insurance to make some extra money to put towards a house deposit.I would often go out with the girls on a Friday or Saturday, but would be the designated driver so I could get up in the morning and go to work.As I had a more money in savings than Jamie when we met, we decided it made sense for him to move in with me.What are your tips for other first timers?JAMIE and Emma share their top tips on what it takes to save for your first home:Make use of Government schemes, such as the Help to Buy ISA, as you really do get “money for nothing.”Take advantage of cashback via a site such as Topcashback whenever you can. It takes very little effort, and you can end up with a big chunk of money for making purchases you were going to make anyway. This cash – which is also “money for nothing” – can be a real boost to your savings. The site also features voucher codes which can come in useful. I wouldn’t be without it.Be prepared to work extra hours. If you want a home enough, working over-time is totally do-able.This meant he could live rent-free while he saved his half of the deposit – though he did contribute towards food and other household bills.We made the decision to live together just six weeks after meeting one another which was quite brave, but we both felt it was a chance worth taking.Jamie then took on extra work at the weekend – on top of working at nights. At times, this wasn’t easy for him.We restricted the amount we went out, and cut back on how much we spent on things for ourselves. There were also no lavish holidays for a year or so.We both opened new current accounts with Nationwide too and took advantage of the switching offer, which meant we each got £100.We also both opened Help to Buy ISAs with Nationwide while we were saving – so both benefited from the Government bonus.In total, we each got a bonus of around £500 from the Government which was a real help.SWNS:South West News Service12 Emma and Jamie have been living in their new home now for two yearsSWNS:South West News Service12 The pair paid £229,000 for the property in and used a Help to Buy loanHow did you find the property?We were focused on finding a new-build so we could take advantage of the Government Help to Buy loan and didn't want a place that needed a lot of work doing to it.At the same time, we were keen to live in an area walking distance from my workplace – and close to Jamie’s family.We actually pulled out of the first new-build property we reserved because we found out we had to buy all the flooring and appliances on top of the sale price.This would have cost us an extra £20,000 – a sum we just couldn’t afford.We then found our home in another development, just around the corner from where I work. With this property, all the fittings, carpets, flooring and white good were included.How much can you save using cashback sites? EMMA and Jamie saved cash by shopping through TopCashback. Here are some of their top savings: Bed and mattress from Bensons for Beds, £939.48 - Cashback: £69.03 Bedside cabinets and dressing table from Dwell, £119.60 - Cashback: £3.14 Bedside cabinets and a dressing table from Argos, £171.93 - Cashback: £2.70Light shades from Habitat, £59.05 - Cashback: £1.23Bedding from Dunelm, £114.9 - Cashback: £5.06Towel rails and other fittings from BathStore, £73.33 - Cashback: £2.42Home insurance with Hastings Direct, £212.23 - Cashback: £20.40Car breakdown cover through the AA, £165 - Cashback: £54.99Getting quotes on car insurance from price comparison site, Gocompare.com, free - Cashback: £2.10 Unfortunately, the developer hadn’t built a show-home for the particular option of property we were looking to buy, so we bought off-plan.We put down a reservation fee in August 2015. At this stage, we’d only been together five months – so it really was quite a brave decision – especially as neither of us had owned a home before.Were there any issues?There were no major issues, except a bit of work that had to be done in the garden, including adding extra paving and laying a lawn.Other than that, there were just a few minor snagging issues, but we didn’t have to pay for any of the work, as all costs were covered by the developer for the first two years after we moved in.How did you afford the furniture?We ordered just about every piece of furniture we needed through Topcashback - a site which will basically pay you to shop through them.We put any money we earned straight into our account, initially to cover our moving costs – and then to cover bills when we finally moved into our new home.The amount varied massively. For example, we paid £939.48 for our bed and mattress from Bensons for Beds and got £69.03 cashback, but we only got £2.70 back after spending £171.93 in Argos on bedside cabinets and a dressing table.SWNS:South West News Service12 The couple began buying their furniture before they moved into their new homeSWNS:South West News Service12 The savvy savers got £69 cashback by spending £939.48 on their bed and mattress from BensonsWe used the website as much as we could on things like light shades, bedding and towel rails. Even though the savings didn't sound like much on their own they all began to add up.It worked for our utilities too. For example, we paid £212.23 for our home insurance with Hastings Direct and got £20.40 cashback, and we also got cashback when we set up our broadband with Sky.We paid £165 for car breakdown cover through the AA, and got £54.99 cashback. We even got £2.10 cashback just for getting quotes on car insurance from price comparison site, Gocompare.com.SWNS:South West News Service12 After spending £171.93 on bedside cabinets and a dressing table from Argos they only got £2.70 cashbackSWNS:South West News Service12 It only takes Emma 20 minutes to walk to work and the house is round the corner from Jamie's familyIt felt like ""money for nothing"" at a time when we had money going out of account left, right and centre. Getting cashback was a bit of a ""pick me up.""What’s the area like?The location is ideal as, I can walk from home to work within 20 minutes, plus Jamie’s family lives just a 10 minute drive away.We are also close to all sorts of shops and amenities, including a Tesco, Costa, Greggs, pub, gym, bank, doctor’s surgery and several parks.The area feels very welcoming, and there’s a community centre which hosts lots of meetings and activities all year round – so there’s always plenty of opportunity to meet other local people.MY FIRST HOMEFULL HOUSE How I saved £32k for first house and wedding and STILL enjoyed nights out SAVVY SAVER Ditching nights out helps first-time buyer save extra £850 a month PENTHOUSE PAD Childhood pals clubbed together to buy £525k three-bed London flat BUYER BEWARE We nearly lost dream home due to mortgage adviser's error - and it cost us £4k FLY THE NEST First-time buyers, 32, spend 10 YEARS saving £40k deposit for one-bed flat HOME AND AWAY First-time buyer saved £17k deposit in a year by becoming a super scrimper When will you move again?We don’t have a family yet, but hope we will in the future. If this happens, we’ll need to think about moving again as we’ll need more space – especially if we end up having two children. It would also be nice to have a bigger garden once little ones come along.But for the next five years or so, I think we’ll be happy here.What help is out there for first-time buyers?GETTING on the property ladder can feel like a daunting task but there are schemes out there to help first-time buyers have their own home.Help to Buy Isa - It's a tax-free savings account where for every £200 you save, the Government will add an extra £50. But there's a maximum limit of £3,000 which is paid to your solicitor when you move.Help to Buy equity loan - The Government will lend you up to 20 per cent of the home's value - or 40 per cent in London - after you've put down a five per cent deposit. The loan is on top of a normal mortgage but it can only be used to buy a new build property.Lifetime Isa - This is another Government scheme that gives anyone aged 18 to 39 the chance to save tax-free and get a bonus of up to £32,000 towards their first home. You can save up to £4,000 a year and the Government will add 25 per cent on top.Shared ownership - Co-owning with a housing association means you can buy a part of the property and pay rent on the remaining amount. You can buy anything from 25 to 75 per cent of the property but you're restricted to specific ones.""First dibs"" in London - London Mayor Sadiq Khan is working on a scheme that will restrict sales of all new-build homes in the capital up to £350,000 to UK buyers for three months before any overseas marketing can take place.Starter Home Initiative - A Government scheme that will see 200,000 new-build homes in England sold to first-time buyers with a 20 per cent discount by 2020. To receive updates on the progress of these homes you can register your interest on the Starter Homes website.We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online Money team?

31,Dad-of-two launches beer made of leftover bread and his company now turns over £1m a year,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/7814514/toast-ale-start-up-beer-bread-food-waste/,"20th December 2018, 7:00 am","BEER made out of bread sounds like a strange concept - but a dad-of-two has turned this quirky idea into a million-pound business.Rob Wilson from Kent launched Toast Ale - a beer made from surplus bread - in 2016 and the company now turns over £1million a year.Jon Bond - The Sun4 Rob Wilson- launched Toast Ale - a beer made from surplus bread - in 2016The 35-year-old told The Sun: “The idea was to provide a tasty solution to the shocking daily waste of bread. We estimate that 44 per cent of all bread is thrown away in the UK.”He explains that co-founder Tristiam Stuart, a food activist and friend of Rob’s, was inspired to use leftover bread to make beer after a trip to Brussels where he tried Babylone - a beer produced by a Belgian brewer which follows the same process.But making beer out of bread isn’t actually new – Toast Ale’s recipe is inspired by a 4,000-year-old practice from the ancient city of Babylon in Mesopotamia, where today’s Iraq sits.To make the beer, Toast Ale replaces some of the malt in the brew with bread, extracting starches and breaking them down into fermentable sugars, so the bread is more than just a flavouring.Jon Bond - The Sun4 Their first beer style was a popular Pale Ale. In 2017, Toast also started to brew two new beer styles – a Session IPA and Craft LagerJon Bond - The Sun4 Rob says it's a ""privilege"" to have such a hard working teamToast Ale takes surplus bread from sarnie factories, bakeries and supermarket that would otherwise be thrown away.Each bottle has the equivalent of one slice of bread in it and an alcohol content of 4.5 per cent - but you won't find any croutons bobbing in your brew.Instead, the drink has a smooth finish with a hint of caramel, citrus and wheat.But setting up the company wasn’t easy.Rob said: “I couldn’t directly quit my job. At the time I was running an organisation called Ashoka that supports social enterprises and social entrepreneurs.""At first I had to treat Toast Ale like a side hustle, which meant a lot of homework and long hours.Rob's top tips for other wanna be entrepreneursROB has the following advice for others thinking of starting their own business:Find something you’re passionate about: You need to be ready to completely dedicate yourself to your project and believe in it.It’s not all fun and games: Accept the fact that there’s going to be some tough times. Be prepared and don’t give up the first time you hit a wall.Surround yourself with good people: Make sure you have a good network of people that can support you during these tough times, listen to their advice.Make time and space for yourself: Having your own company is a 24/7 job, make sure you save some time for your family and holidays. At the end of the day, it will be better for you, your company, your employees and your family.Know your strength and weaknesses: Surround yourself by people that have skills that you don't. I am aware of my weaknesses and I have an amazing team to support me when I need help.“Six months after the launch, I resigned to be involved with Toast Ale full-time. It was terrible timing. I was expecting my second child and Thomas, my eldest was just two-years-old, so he also needed attention.“I had to have a serious conversation with my wife. She was worried but very supportive.”Co-founder Tristiam still continues to manage Feedback, the environmental campaigning organisation he founded in addition to his work with Toast Ale.The two friends launched the company using tens of thousands of their own savings and their hard work is finally paying off.Jon Bond - The Sun4 To make the beer, Toast Ale replaces some of the malt in the brew with bread, extracting starches and breaking them down into fermentable sugarsToast Ale has now expanded from a small brewery in Hackney in east London to much bigger premises in Yorkshire. Although, the pair mostly manage the company from their office in South London.From a small team of four people it now employs 25 workers worldwide - including 18 in the UK.Their first beer style was a popular Pale Ale. In 2017, Toast successfully raised an additional £30,000 on Crowdfunder with an initial £1,000 crowdfunding support from GoDaddy to brew two new beer styles – a Session IPA and a Craft Lager, which were released in 2018.Here, investors were given three jumbo cases of 24 bottles of Toast Ale for £150 worth of funding.That same year Toast also teamed up with the Chelsea Craft Brewing Company in New York to create an American pale ale.In the UK, the beer is stocked in major retailers including Tesco, Waitrose and Wholefoods at about £2 a bottle.

Some Christmases you can’t add much, but the important thing is to just establish it and add to it when you can.”Rather than buy the latest Jacquard jacket for my granddaughter, who will just grow out of in three to four months, I want to think of her futureAmanda DerhamAmanda says she didn’t have the money to do investment as a gift for her own children, but hopes her approach to Christmas and birthdays will teach her grandkids about saving and money management.She explained: “I hope they think wow, in the same way I was in awe of what my grandmother did for me.“I think people have to be happy with their decision and how they spend their money.“I can’t afford the latest and the greatest all the time so my preference is to save and put money away for them when I can.”MOST READ IN FABULOUSBOT'S UP DOC I covered medics, my baby and the wall with a huge poo explosion during labour ROYALLY SWEET The Queen paid tribute to Meg when out with Kate by repeating wedding outfit THICK AND FAB ‘Slim Thick’ is THE body shape celebs are striving for this summer FEELING BLUE Woman turns into Smurf when bath bomb dyed her skin blue after just 5 minutes MYSTIC MEG May 22: Love choices will happen in a rush as you feel pressured by your looks BARELY THERE Fashion Nova launches plastic strap bikinis leaving NOTHING to the imagination Not everyone thinks like this gran, however.We shared how one mum spends £1,700 buying HUNDREDS of Christmas presents for her kids and refuses to let people ‘guilt trip’ her about it.We previously told how a mum-of-six bought all 240 of her Christmas presents in last year’s Black Friday sales.And another finished Christmas shopping for her kids in March and has bought them almost 70 gifts.Dream Toys 2018 - top Christmas presents include unicorn that poos and Fortnite version of Monopoly  "

But it's a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If you're falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the payments if you're part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £348 if you're single, £464 if you're part of a couple or £812 if you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. You'll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. You'll still have to repay the loan, even if you stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Payments if your payments aren't enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If you're really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free.

including Brit Tim Peake - have said humans could colonise the Red Planet as early as 2040, with a proper settlement established by 2050.A panel of specialists worked alongside a visualisation team to predict how future Martian homes are likely to look, with interior and exterior images released for a variety of futuristic residential builds.8 Architects predict family homes will be built within protective caves and include a driveway8 Mars mansions will be part of a crater community, boasting showstopping vistas across the cavity from three levelsStephen Petranek, author of the book How We’ll Live on Mars, which the National Geographic series MARS is based on, said: “It’s exciting to think that humans will be living on Mars far sooner than most people think.“The second series of MARS considers how a community might be built and sustained on the Red Planet in the 2040s, and what the challenges will be both from a practical and a human standpoint.“For this forward-thinking project, we’ve predicted what different homes on Mars might actually look like, with options to suit a range of budgets.“There are plenty of elements to consider, from ensuring an adequate shield to the harsh radiation Mars endures because its atmosphere is so thin, to the need for homely touches reminiscent of Earth.8 The interior of a mansion on the Red Planet8 After a hard day of farming in near zero-parents can come home and put their feet up with their kids in this radiation-proof family home8 A look inside an Martian apartment, designed to tempt young processionals to the space colony“Ultimately, living on Mars must seem more appealing and psychologically inviting than living on Earth or not enough people will want to make a new life there.“As we make these predictions now, we can only wonder what designs we will actually adopt as hundreds of thousands of people eventually move to the Red Planet.”The Mars apartment block features a number of living pods aimed at individuals and couples, with tunnels leading to a central shared garden and work spaces.It is protected from the sun’s rays by tinted glazing featuring coating technology developed to filter out the radiation and rammed earth walls, designed to protect from the cold as well as cosmic rays.8 Experts unveiled a floorplan of an average family home on Mars8 A apartment floorplan shows a cosy one-bedroom pad for colony dwellersThe family home is built within a protective cave, with a driveway leading to an inbuilt garage as well as a conservatory-style veranda made from protective glass that offers a small indoor garden area.The kind of natural light we would usually get from our windows on Earth is simulated via LEDs and camera systems that can show the outside landscape in real-time to mimic windows, and could even be programmed to provide other vistas.For example parks, forests, rivers - familiar sights from Earth that our Martian residents might be missing.The mansion is part of a crater community, offering show stopping vistas across the cavity from three levels.It boasts a huge living space with private indoor garden and multi-gym that allows for ‘outdoor’ activities such as sports to take place in an artificially-oxygenated environment as well as a car port that can hold multiple vehicles.MOST READ IN NEWSDYING WISH Single mum loses fight with cancer after asking family 'Look after my boys' ExclusiveROO'S FURY Wayne Rooney livid after bro filmed looking pally in pub loo with Tommy Robinson ZAPPED TO DEATH Toddler killed after putting phone charger in mouth while plugged into wall 'RAPE' RAP Oritse Williams' manager admits touching 'zombified' girl as 'star raped her' COT CLOTS Celebs' pics of babies sleeping in unsafe conditions 'fuelling cot death rise' WarningMOB JUSTICE Furious crowds strip female ‘shoplifters’ naked, batter them and cut their hair According to the National Geographic research a fifth of Brits predict that it will be possible to move to Mars within their lifetime, and there is a significant appetite to make an interplanetary move.One in six revealed that with people struggling to get on the housing ladder on Earth, buying property on Mars is looking like a more attractive prospect.Brits revealed that the opportunity to enjoy a better quality of life, the desire to seek new adventure and the need to flee human dangers on Earth such as war would be the most likely factors to precipitate a move to Mars.However, almost nine in ten predicted they would miss some aspects about life on Earth, including their pets and even the British weather.Life on Mars?

37,There’s no need for an Irish hard border – it’s just a barrier put up by scaremongers,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7733555/irish-hard-border-just-barrier-scaremongers/,"14th November 2018, 12:21 am","DURING all my years as an MP, the interest shown in Northern Ireland by most of my colleagues has been minimal.Even with over a thousand members there, the party still disallows Labour candidates to stand in elections.Getty - Contributor6 There's no need for an Irish hard border - it's just a barrier put up by scaremongersSo it has been rather ironic that in the Brexit debate Labour MPs have been queuing up to mention Northern Ireland.What happens at the border after we leave the EU has become the “big sticking point” causing our Prime Minister to make commitments to backstops that few understand and even fewer support.The repeatedly stated aim of the EU, the UK and the Irish government is to avoid creating a hard border.They never actually define what a hard border is, but I assume that they mean not having huge structures acting as barriers with flashing lights and cameras as used to be there.Getty Images - Getty6 The Irish Government has made the Irish border an issue and Theresa May has fallen for itIt is conveniently forgotten that those barriers were only there when the IRA was active, bombing and killing our soldiers and police officers.A border is there at the moment, although not visible.The Irish Republic has different excise duties, VAT rates and currency to the UK.Yet all those differences are handled remotely by technology and pre-paperwork.Getty - Contributor6 There's no need for a hard border - the UK has had a closer relationship to Ireland than any other European countryIf intelligence arouses suspicion about smuggling, the vehicle will be stopped.In other words, with goodwill and co-operation, there is no need for a “hard border”.The Irish government, in cahoots with the EU, has deliberately made the border an issue.Unfortunately, our Prime Minister and her officials have completely fallen for it by agreeing to a backstop that would potentially see Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK.Theresa May refuses to deny that no-deal Brexit could lead to hard border in IrelandImplying that the peace process is threatened by a hard border is scaremongering of the worst kind.We should be prosecuting those who are breaking the law, not allowing them to shape our policy on leaving the EU.The Irish Republic and UK shared a common travel area long before either joined even the Common Market.We have always had a closer relationship with the Irish than other EU citizens, and the EU has not objected.6 The Irish Gvernment would suffer the most if the UK were to leave the EU on World Trade Organisation rulesAll the Irish living in Great Britain were able to vote in the referendum and many voted to Leave.After the financial crash in 2008 British taxpayers pumped £20billion into the Irish economy and helped bail out their banks.Yet despite all this the Irish government is playing hardball even though they would suffer most if the UK were to leave on World Trade Organisation rules.The EU wants to keep us locked in to their regulations and rules and the Irish seem to be doing everything they can to support the intransigent EU Commission.Getty - Contributor6 The barriers were only there when the IRA was active, bombing and killing our soldiers and police officersIrish leader Leo Varadkar has behaved rather shamefully with some of his rhetoric and is perhaps intent on becoming a future EU commissioner.The previous Taoiseach Enda Kenny had allowed his officials to talk to British counterparts about Brexit, but Mr Varadkar has stopped that.The hypocrisy is breathtaking because his government has already erected a hard border against fishermen from Northern Ireland.Pre-dating membership of the EEC, a 1965 neighbourhood agreement between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland granted reciprocal access to fishermen from each jurisdiction to fish in each other’s territorial waters, reflecting traditional and historic fishing patterns around the island.6 Irish leader Leo Varadkar has behaved rather shamefully with some of his rhetoric and is perhaps intent on becoming a future EU CommissionerBut as a result of a decision by Dublin’s Supreme Court two years ago Northern Ireland vessels are no longer allowed to fish in Irish waters, yet Irish fishing vessels continue to benefit from access to fish in British waters around Northern Ireland.Mr Varadkar’s government has erected and maintained a hard border against Northern Ireland fishermen in the hope that this will exert influence on the UK during wider Brexit negotiations.Our UK government claims to be maintaining the moral high ground on these issues, but the question arises — how long does the UK keep to the moral high ground when dealing with an Irish government that is taking our goodwill for granted?When will the Prime Minister speak out and condemn this behaviour?MOST READ IN OPINIONCommentJANE MOORE Time for something completely different…let's put the boot in at EU elections CommentDAMIAN GREEN How Tory leadership race can lead to every Brit having a shot at the good life CommentALLY ROSS Graham Norton shouldn't have spared Madge's blushes as he lashed Eurovision acts CommentTHE SUN SAYS PM's desperate Brexit capitulation achieved nothing but alienating everyone CommentTHE SUN SAYS Hipster who threw MILKSHAKE achieved nothing but to recruit more Farage fans CommentNICK TIMOTHY Tinderbox Tories will get burned at the ballots - they need a new plan When will she start speaking out in support of British citizens rather than seeming to care more about Irish views?When will she stand up for the Northern Ireland fishing community.It is this hypocrisy from Dublin that makes it certain that I and many other MPs will not support an agreement with the EU that panders to this kind of behaviour.Kate Hoey is the Labour MP for Vauxhall and campaigned to leave the EU.French Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau says UK must break the Brexit deadlock over the Irish border GOT a story?

39,What does the Budget 2018 mean for you and are you a winner or a loser?,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/7611062/budget-2018-are-you-a-winner-or-a-loser-and-what-does-it-mean-for-you/,"29th October 2018, 7:50 pm","Today the Chancellor Philip Hammond promised to help strivers, grafters and carers who he said are ""the backbone of our community and economy"" in the coming year.In the speech in the House of Commons, Mr Hammond said his Budget would pave the way for a brighter future - but what does this mean for the money in your pocket?4 First-time buyers, some drinkers and workers will all benefitA stamp duty exemption was extended to first-time buyers in shared ownership, fuel duty was frozen, a new fund for road repairs and an increase to the personal allowance were all announced in the Budget today.Here we take a look at who will benefit most from the changes announced and where they will hit the hardest.WinnersFirst-time buyersStamp duty is to be extended for first-time buyers who are in shared ownership on properties worth up to £500,000.This stamp duty relief will be effective on all homes bought on or after 29 October and it will be backdated to November 22 2017.Mr Hammond said in the Budget today that 121,500 first-time buyers had already benefited from the scrapping of stamp duty after it was brought in last yearDriversFuel duty remained the same for the ninth year in a row after the Chancellor ditched a planned 2p-a-litre rise in a bid to ease the burden on motorists.The tax on fuel currently stands at 57.95p per litre of petrol, diesel, biodiesel and bioethanol.The freeze, which was announced in Philip Hammond's Budget today, is a huge victory for The Sun’s long-running Keep It Down campaign — and for our readers.A £420million fund was also confirmed for the Local Highway Authorities to spend on repairing potholes, bridges and other minor works in the next financial year.4 Here's what Philip Hammond announced in his Budget at a glanceWorkersMillions of workers will get an extra boost in their pay packet as the Chancellor confirmed he will increase the personal allowance to £12,500 from April 2019.It currently stands at £11,850 and it had been predicted this would be frozen, instead of increased.The change means workers will get an extra £120 in their pay packet if they pay the basic rate of tax.The personal allowance for higher-rate taxpayers will rise to £50,000, from £46,300, giving these workers an extra £860 a year.Low-earnersThe National Living Wage will rise to £8.21 from April 2019, it was confirmed.It will rise from £7.83 meaning a 5 per cent boost for Britain's lowest paid workers.Mr Hammond said today: ""From April the National Living Wage will rise again, handing a full-time worker a £690 annual pay increase.""Getty - Contributor4 The price of beer will not go up, it was confined todayUniversal Credit claimantsExtra funding will be made available for those claiming Universal Credit and 2.4million households are set to benefit, Mr Hammond confirmed.The Work Allowance element of the new welfare scheme will be increased to £1,000 - allowing millions of people to earn £630 more from next April before their benefits are slashed.Low-income familiesA new low-interest loan system was announced for those in serious debt.It will provide an alternative for those who rely on high-cost credit and will see the government working with banks and leading debt charities to help design a pilot scheme that will launch early next year.Beer and spirit drinkersBeer, cider and spirits will not go up in price as the Chancellor confirmed a one-year tax freeze on them in today's Budget.In an early Christmas present for drinkers and struggling pubs across the country, the Chancellor scrapped a planned tax hike in line with inflation, which would have seen prices rise by 3.4 per cent.The planned tax hike would have added as much as 30p to the price of a bottle of spirits such as gin and whisky.High-street shopsIn a bid to solve the housing crisis, empty high-street shops could be turned into homes, it was announced.The Chancellor said he will consult on relaxing planning rules as he pours £675million of funding into the struggling high street.This will not only increase the supply of housing, it will also help regenerate battered high streets as it would ensure that more empty storefronts could become family homes.Getty - Contributor4 Stamp duty tax breaks will be extended for those in shared ownershipLosersSmokersThe cost of cigarettes is set to soar to £10 a pack as the Chancellor confirmed a hike in tobacco tax.Mr Hammond is raising the tobacco duty by two per cent above September's inflation rate of 2.4 per cent, which adds roughly 24p, excluding inflation, to a pack of cigarettes.The average pack of fags in the UK currently costs £9.91, according to figures from Statista.Wine drinkersAlthough there will be a freeze on the duty for beer, cider and spirits, wine duty will rise in line with inflation by 3.4 per cent.This will add 7p to a bottle of wine and 9p to a bottle of fizz.The price of high-strength cheap white ciders will also go up. The rises will take place from February 1, 2019.Digital firmsA new digital services tax will be introduced from April 2020 for technology firms.It will apply to ""established tech giants"" Mr Hammond said, such as Amazon and Facebook and it is hoped it will raise £400million to pay for public services.more on budget 2018MAKING ENDS MEET When do the Real Living Wage and the National Living Wage increase?

PRICEY PLONK Cheap wine prices to soar due to shake-up of tax rules Hard-working familiesDespite promises by the Chancellor to deliver a budget for hard-working families, there were hardly any mentions of measures to help this group.There was no mention, for example, of extra help towards childcare costs even though it has been widely reported that working parents are struggling as nursery fees rise three times faster than wages. Here's what we can expect from Chancellor Philip Hammond's Budget of 2018We pay for your stories!

I’m trying to think of a reason why anyone would actively want to deface a war memorial...”Facebook7 Emily Dawes, president of Southampton University student unionAnother added: “Jesus. are all students left wing morons. Only academia could protest a painting that depicts men lost at war protecting the freedoms you take for granted.“It's of days gone not present day. You cant rewrite history even though you lot want to. Grow up. Pathetic.”One said: “What’s she studying, clearly not history. Why can’t people accept you can’t change history. These young men went to far a war against tyranny. Her words are not far off that ! Do this or else.”Another blasted Dawes and said: ""It’s a Painting showing students who did not return from the war you imbecile. You are a f*****g r***** with no shame and no understanding of what sacrifice is.""Twitter7 The president of the University of Southampton's Student Union tweeted this in reference to the Rothenstein MuralOthers fumed that to even want to personally vandalise this mural was “disrespectful” and a “disgrace”.They said: “One of the most insensitive and disrespectful comments I have ever seen.

If there are black people forgotten you'd have mine (and most people's) support to include them. We should represent everyone equally.“By suggesting the memorial of men who died to protect your freedoms is racist says more about you.”Dawes finally issued a grovelling apology one day after her original tweet and two hours after The Sun Online published its story.Twitter7 Another said this was the wrong way to bring up the issueShe said: ""Firstly, and most importantly, I would like to apologise for the offence and upset I have caused with what I have said.

Suddenly my friend heard a strange noise and said: “What was that?”I looked out of her window to see a young boy running up our street, shouting: “Call an ambulance.”My blood ran cold - had something happened to my little girl?Caroline Morgan12 Caroline has bravely discussed the horror smash and spoken about her daughter's remarkable recoveryCaroline Morgan12 Jadae, pictured recently, defied the doctors' diagnosis and can now walk and talkRushing outside, I found Jadae unconscious on the road - she was wedged beneath a parked car, where she’d been knocked by the force of a collision with a car travelling at around 30mph.She had a severe head injury, a broken clavicle and a fractured ankle.Jadae was taken by air ambulance to a specialist head injury hospital, and put in an induced coma. Surgeons operated to fix a bolt to her skull to monitor the pressure inside her brain.Family and friends looked after my other kids Jermayi (now 12) and Jahzel (now 8), while I sat at her bedside.For days, Jadae just lay there, unmoving, with a machine breathing for her, being fed by tube, and surrounded by beeping monitors and machines.Caroline Morgan12 Jadae had a severe head injury, a broken clavicle and a fractured ankle after the smashCaroline Morgan12 Jadae, pictured with Caroline Jermayi, now 12 and Jahzel, now eightA week after the accident, a doctor told me: “There has been no improvement. We’re not sure if there’s anything else we can do to help your daughter.” I replied: “Find something.”But weeks came and went, and still Jadae remained completely unresponsive.Desperate for some sign of life in her, doctors even tried putting strong-tasting foods like hot mustard and chilli in her mouth, to see if she’d react - but nothing.I was scared she was never coming back. But I kept hoping and praying.Six weeks after the accident one doctor came to me and said: “Your daughter is in a persistent vegetative state. She is not going to improve. As her mother, you need to accept that she’ll never again be anything more than a head in a bed.”Caroline Morgan12 Jadae, pictured before the accident, was taken by air ambulance to a specialist head injury hospitalWhat is The Children's Trust?Every year over 40,000 children in the UK are left with a brain injury as a result of an accident or illness, according to NHS England. This is known as acquired brain injury.Many children make a good recovery, but thousands have to live with ongoing, long-term difficulties. Some children are left with severe physical difficulties or learning difficulties.The Children's Trust is the UK's leading charity for children with brain injury.The trust provides rehabilitation, education and community services through skilled teams who work with children and young people, and their families.Music therapy is a key part of the trust’s work.The Children’s Trust has just launched its Extraordinary Music Box Appeal. To donate, go to www.thechildrenstrust.org.ukI was furious. Felt myself turn bright red. I couldn’t believe he’d used such cruel, insensitive words about my child as to call her “a head in a bed”.I snapped: “Don’t talk like that about my little girl. You don’t know her, you have no idea about what she’s capable of,” and marched out.But the truth is, I could see no improvement in her either, and I feared he might be right.I couldn’t believe he’d used such cruel, insensitive words about my child as to call her 'a head in a bed'Caroline Morgan Jadae's mumAfter two months in that hospital, Jadae was transferred to another hospital, closer to our family home, so I could visit her more easily.By the end of a month there, she was showing small signs of response, and could lift her head off the pillow to kiss her favourite teddy bear.But she still wasn’t talking, couldn’t sit up unaided, was unable to stand or walk, or feed herself, and needed to be fed through a tube.Caroline Morgan12 Jadae was left in a persistent vegatative stateCaroline Morgan12 Jadae owes her recovery to the specialist help she got at The Children’s Trust. She has learned to feed herself againIn December 2015, three months after the accident, Jadae was moved again - this time to a specialist rehabilitation centre in Tadworth, Surrey, run by The Children’s Trust, Britain’s leading charity for children with brain injury.Thankfully, with the trust’s expert help, within days of arrival she had started to improve.One morning, in January 2016, a nurse told me: “Jadae asked for a cup of tea.”At first I didn’t believe it. After all, Jadae hadn’t spoken a word for three months – and didn’t even like tea!But later that day, I was sitting with her and asked: “Can you say my name?” She mumbled quietly: “Caroline.” Then when I asked more questions, she named every member of our immediate family.I burst into tears of happiness - it felt like a miracle.Caroline Morgan12 The Children's Trust helped Jadae get back on her feetOddly enough, before the accident she never drank tea but ever since she began to recover, she has at least two cups a day.Jadae spent six months at The Children’s Trust receiving intensive therapy, rebuilding her strength, coordination and balance. A combination of physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language and specialist play activities saw her come on in leaps and bounds.In occupational therapy she practised tasks like dressing up, baking and washing up.Her favourite game was the ‘shopping game’ where staff created a shopping list and Jadae had to find every item on the shelves. While playing, she was having fun - but she was also practising her reaching, grabbing and hand-eye coordination without even realising it.She had other therapy designed to help her walk again, using frames and parallel bars.But it was perhaps the music therapy that was most enjoyable for her.Caroline Morgan12 Music helped Jadae's recovery and she now goes to a mainstream schoolJadae joined the trust’s Glitter Group, where a play team helped the kids to learn songs and put on performances.As her speech improved, she even did a solo performance before staff and parents one day, singing It’s a Hard Knock Life. There wasn’t a dry eye in the house.Music could always lift Jadae’s mood, during those very difficult times.Although still in a wheelchair, with challenges to her mobility and movement, she was keen to make up dance routines with the other girls. I suppose music therapy helped her focus on what she could do, rather than what she couldn’t.By the time Jadae left the Children’s Trust, nine months after her accident, she could walk independently again, a few steps at a time.Caroline Morgan12 Jadae is now able to walk but uses her wheelchair when she has to travel long distancesToday, three years on, she is back at her mainstream primary school and uses a wheelchair only when she is tired or has to walk further distances.However, she’s due to move to a specialist school for children with disabilities, in the near future.My beautiful, brave little girl has come so far. When she left the trust, she was talking fluently again, but her speech was indistinct and people often couldn’t understand her.Now her speech is so much clearer.Of course, there are lasting effects from the accident - she tires easily and everything is that little bit harder for her, than for other children.How does music therapy work?Dr Jonathan Pool, a music therapist who worked with Jadae, says: “In these sessions, each child works on their own needs while also being part of a group experience; collaborating on musical pieces, practicing attention training exercises and shared their experiences.“Music therapy helped Jadade address many issues resulting from her accident - including included concentration, self-expression, arm and hand movements and the use of her voice.“She loved to play percussion and sing, and enjoyed strumming a guitar’s strings while a music therapist held the chords and sang the lyrics.“Through music therapy, Jadae improved her ability to concentrate and was able to participate in groups - a useful way of preparing children and young people for their return to their community and to school.“At first, she found it difficult to concentrate in the group and participate. But though music therapy she developed her confidence to express herself musically and then use her voice to share her thoughts with her peers.”Caroline Morgan12 Caroline has shared her daughter's story to show the recovery children with brain injuries can makeJadae owes her recovery to the specialist help she got at The Children’s Trust but it’s a charity, partly relying on donations to keep it going.I want to tell her story to thank the trust and show what’s possible, if children with brain injuries just get the right help.When I see my daughter now, thinking of how much she has achieved and how hard she tries, I am incredibly proud of her.But I still look back and remember that doctor’s cruel words when he described her future as nothing more than a head in a bed and realise how close she came to being written off.Thanks heavens there were other wonderful, positive people there to stop that happening.For more information go to the www.thechildrenstrust.org.ukMost read in FabulousBOT'S UP DOC I covered medics, my baby and the wall with a huge poo explosion during labour ROYALLY SWEET The Queen paid tribute to Meg when out with Kate by repeating wedding outfit THICK AND FAB ‘Slim Thick’ is THE body shape celebs are striving for this summer FEELING BLUE Woman turns into Smurf when bath bomb dyed her skin blue after just 5 minutes MYSTIC MEG May 22: Love choices will happen in a rush as you feel pressured by your looks BARELY THERE Fashion Nova launches plastic strap bikinis leaving NOTHING to the imagination Yesterday we told the tragic story of a boy, 4,  who who fell ill on his first day of school and died of deadly meningitis.A student, 18, diagnosed with meningitis after her eagle-eyed gran spotted her rash in FaceTime call.A tragic mum also revealed how her abortion failed and she gave birth to a live baby who died in her arms.'Miracle' severe acquired brain injury patient Padraig Schaler enjoys some music therapy"

51,Thousands of new-build buyers were ‘mis-sold’ leasehold homes,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/uncategorized/7199377/two-thirds-of-new-build-buyers-were-mis-sold-leasehold-homes/,,"7th September 2018,11:16 amTHE vast majority of homeowners who bought a leasehold house now regret it, while many feel they were mis-sold and some are struggling to sell up, a report has found.Leasehold house owners can find themselves paying ground rent as well as other fees to make changes to their homes.			Getty - Contributor		1		Freeholders charge homeowners £1,422 to install double glazing, £887 to change kitchen units, and £689 to replace flooring	Research from NAEA Propertymark found that leaseholders paid an average of £277 per year in ground rent when they moved in, and are currently paying an average of £319, with most having been in their properties for three or four years.But the charges don’t stop there. NAEA Propertymark said freeholders typically charge leasehold homeowners £1,422 to install double glazing, £887 to change the kitchen units, and £689 to replace the flooring.Some faced bills of £527 for changing their blinds and £411 for installing a new front door.The research also found that more than half (57 per cent) of the owners it surveyed did not realise what being a leaseholder meant until they had bought the property.What happens when you take out a leasehold					OWNING a leasehold on a property means that you have the right to live in the property for a set period of time.				In the UK the standard amount of time is 125 years.Buying a property leasehold means you are essentially a tenant in your own home.It can make it more difficult to sell on the property, particularly if the lease isn’t very long.It can also mean that your house is worth less.You may have to ask the permission of the person who fully owns the property (the freeholder) before making changes such as adding an extension or owning a pet.It also means that any upkeep of a shared area, including the exterior walls and the roof, is the responsibility of the freeholder, so you won’t have to pay for any repairs in those areas.Some 94 per cent regret buying a leasehold and 62 per cent feel they were mis-sold.The NAEA estimates that this equates to thousands of people who believe they were mis-sold. But it’s impossible to pinpoint the exact number as there are no nationwide figures on the number of new builds that are sold leasehold.More than three-quarters (78 per cent) had bought their home directly from developers and nearly half (48 per cent) were first-time buyers.Of those currently trying to sell their home, a third (31 per cent) said they were struggling to attract a buyer because they do not own the freehold and a quarter (25 per cent) said house hunters who were interested were put off when they found out it was a leasehold home.Mark Hayward, chief executive at NAEA Propertymark said: “Most buyers have no idea about the trappings of a leasehold contract until it’s too late.”What if I want to buy a leasehold, what should I look out for?					ANDREW Johnson, money expert at Money Advice Service has some tips on what to consider before buying a leasehold.				Check how many years are left on the lease. You may struggle to get a mortgage on a leasehold property which has less than 70 years to run. A short lease will be a lot more expensive to extend.Ask about the cost of extending your lease now if this might be an issue in the future. You don’t want anything that could impact your property’s saleability in the future.Ask how much the ground rent is. This may be a relatively small amount now but beware escalating ground rents which have seen substantial figures payable at the end of the term of the lease. This could negatively impact your ability to sell your property in the future.Ask about service charges and other related costs. This generally covers repairs or maintenance to the property including buildings insurance. This can be several hundred or several thousand pounds, so consider how you will budget for these costs and the impact of any future increases.The government has been working to make it cheaper and easier for existing leaseholders to buy out their freehold.In July, communities secretary James Brokenshire announced new housing measures for England. He said: “We have seen leaseholders in new-build homes facing unexpected costs rising every year that bear no relation to services and that’s not fair.“So from now on any new Government funding scheme will contain the condition that the money cannot support the unjustified use of leasehold for new homes.”A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said: “It’s unacceptable for home buyers to be exploited through unfair and abusive practices within the leasehold system, and the findings in the Propertymark report underline our position that real action is needed.“This is why we have already announced measures that include a ban on leaseholds for almost all new-build houses and restricting ground rents to a peppercorn.

Would also like to apologise to my neighbours for the disturbance last night. If they've done it once, the likeliness is, they will do it again.I just wish I hadn't gave him the benefit of the doubt and let him worm his way back in. I wish I had listened and taken the advice given to me, but no, I thought I could help him deal with his demons in order to make him a better person.I know I'm not perfect, far from it. My depression/anxiety has been the worst it ever has been these last couple of months and I've been a very difficult person to be around but I know I didn't deserve this.Not when all I've done is be there for him, support him in any way possible, be there for him if/when he needed to talk to someone, encouraged him to open up and speak about what he felt and actually took time to make an appointment so he was able to get help for his anger, stood by him when everyone was telling me to walk away, falling out with friends, family, because I refused to believe he was this monster they thought he was.For what? It's all just been thrown back in my face...literally. For anyone who knows me knows I'm a fiery person, someone who stands up for themselves but when your faced with the person you thought you had a future with charging towards you with what I can only describe as an unforgettable look of hate and anger on their face, that strong independent woman disappears.Being punched, thrown about and head butted in the face and being made to feel like a prisoner in my own home having to climb out of the window whilst pouring with blood to run for help is a memory that will stay with me forever.Feeling like such a f***ing idiot and fool taken in by what I thought was a kind, sweet, romantic boyfriend who would have done anything for me for then to turn at the slightest argument/disagreement, become controlling, aggressive, unrecognizable.This isn't the man I met when I was 13 years old. I don't know this person anymore and I'm starting to question wether I actually did... Thing is with these type of people, they have a certain way of making you believe it's your fault, that you've started the argument, that you've pushed them to do what they've done.They manipulate you into thinking it's all in your head and you're the problem when I'm actual fact, it's all mind games to break you down.I'm sorry if this post has upset/offended anyone because a lot of people haven't seen this side of him, and if someone told me any of this I don't think I'd have believed it myself but from what I've been told by numerous people - a lot of people have witnessed this side of him and that scares me.Before anyone starts saying I've put this post on for attention - no, I really haven't. I've put this post on because I don't want this happening to anyone else.I have a three year old girl who I now have to pluck up the courage to face and try and explain why Mammy's face is poorly, why I'm covered in bruises, why Mammy isn't her happy self and is quite sad and why Rob won't be coming round anymore.

55,Calling Michelle Obama a man and saying Hillary Clinton ran a ‘paedo ring’…  Alex Jones is the most controversial man you’ve probably never heard of,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7037499/alex-jones-controversial/,"17th August 2018, 4:42 pm","ALEX Jones might be America's most controversial man - and he's definitely the angriest.The popular alt-right radio host - who has 90 million listeners - spends his days hunched over a mic, ranting until he's red in the face about the Illuminati, how 9/11 was 'faked by the government', and how Michelle Obama is 'really a man'.YouTube11 Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones rants about politics and society as part of a show on InfowarsBut the controversial star - who has been kicked off all his social media platforms for his offensive remarks - had his popular radio station shut down this week after the authorities realised he was operating a pirate station.Campaigners have been trying to silence the loud-mouthed presenter for years - protesting that his controversial statements and conspiracy theories are damaging to American society.Clinton was a frequent subject of Jones' outbursts during the election campaign - the shock jock called her a 'demon' a proclaimed that a segment where she opened a stiff pickle jar on US chat show Jimmy Kimmel was fixed as she wasn't strong enough to do it.He's also been accused of racism after claiming that Michelle Obama is really a man, and was forced to apologise after spreading the false claim that Hillary Clinton was running a paedophile ring out of a pizza restaurant.These wacky conspiracies are a few of Jones' staple subjects, but his radio show, which attracts millions of listeners and is watched by more on his website, has been known to veer into even stranger - and darker - territory.YouTube11 Jones, posing here with an assault rifle, frequently descends into screaming meltdowns on airFor many, Jones' most controversial belief is that the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting, in which 20 children died, was staged by the Obama government to use as an excuse for gun controls.He is now being sued by some of the murdered schoolchildren's heartbroken families for defamation.Reuters11 Alex Jones is currently being sued for defamation after his claims about the Sandy Hook shooting'They're turning the frogs gay'Another widely-criticised theory Jones peddles is that the US government has successfully developed a ""gay bomb"" which has been used to contaminate American wildlife.""I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay,"" the 44-year-old shouts in a widely-mocked clip from one of his shows, without offering any proof or explanation for the claims.Many may think that Jones is just another tin-foil crackpot screaming into the void, but his website, Infowars, is viewed by an estimated audience of 10 million people.New York magazine, meanwhile, describes him as ""America's leading conspiracy theorist"", and he has been credited with being one of the most high-profile supporters of the alt-right - the loose political movement associated in part with white-supremacy and extremism.YouTube11 In a segment on his show, Jones crafts his own hat out of tin foil in a nod to the trope that it protects from harmful particlesUnderstandably, Jones' controversial beliefs have landed him in a fair amount of trouble.Accused of spreading fake news and sharing malicious lies, Jones has recently received a flurry of suspensions from Facebook and Instagram.Meanwhile, on YouTube, where Jones had 2.4 million subscribers, his Infowars videos have been removed for violating their terms of service - and the same has happened on Vimeo.His podcasts on iTunes and Spotify have also been removed and, this week, Twitter joined the fray - blocking Jones from posting anything for seven days as a punishment for abusive behaviour.AFP or licensors11 Jones has found himself banned from almost every social media platform as part of a recent clampdown on his shocking rantsA screaming face-off with Piers MorganNo matter who tries to shut him down, the larger-than-life shock jock will not be silenced, and some are concerned that censoring Jones will only give legitimacy to his conspiracy beliefs.His show, filmed in a studio in Austin, is still available on his site, and clips can be seen all over the web - along with spoofs and compilations which highlight his most ludicrous outbursts.As he rants about news and politics, Jones frequently gets himself worked up into such a frenzy that he turns red, and is often left panting for breath after his emotive tirades are finished.And there's one subject which is guaranteed to get Jones worked up like nothing else: guns.YouTube11 Alex Jones tried to get Piers Morgan deported with a petition after he spoke out in favour of gun controlJones, who is rumoured to own an arsenal of over 50 firearms, went viral after clashing with Piers Morgan back when he hosted a TV show for CNN.Jones was invited to chat with Piers after he tried to get him deported for his anti-gun stance, and even got 100,000 of his followers to sign a petition demanding Piers be sent back to the UK.But when the pair faced off, Jones launched into a screaming tirade in defence of gun ownership which was mockingly shared around the world.Alex Jones rages at Piers Morgan about guns after trying to get him deportedSupport from Donald TrumpPiers may not have hit it off with the alt-right icon, but Donald Trump did.When he appeared Jones' show in December 2015, Trump heaped praise on him - saying he has an ""amazing reputation"" - and after he was elected, Trump reportedly called Jones to thank him for his support.YouTube11 Trump appeared on Alex Jones' show in 2015 and allegedly thanked him for his support after the electionLike many conspiracy theorists, Jones believes that the moon landings were faked (supposedly to hide secret Nasa technology) and that the government was really behind 9/11.He also believes that an Illuminati-style elite are trying to establish a ""New World Order"" where normal people like him and his listeners will be enslaved and eventually eradicated by the state.Even Lady Gaga has found herself a subject of one of Jones' rants, after the radio host claimed her 2017 Superbowl half-time performance was ""satanic"".""She wears meat suits and does all these rituals—Madonna does it too—and the organisers of the Super Bowl are deciding to defile America and have us bow down to this,"" he said.Lady Gaga wows the audience at Super Bowl 51 during the halftime showConspiracy theorist and 'brain pill' salesmanAlex Jones' current fame, largely among Trump supporters and members of the alt-right, is a far cry from his decidedly normal background.He grew up in Dallas, and his father worked as a dentist, while his mother was a housewife.As a teenager, Jones was a keen football player, but his interests turned to politics after he got into reading right-wing and conspiracy books.He dropped out of Austin Community College after just a few weeks and started working on radio and TV shows, eventually landing his own spot on Texan station KJFK.YouTube11 Jones sells a range of supplements and nutrients on his website, using his show to plug the productsJones built himself into a bit of a radio and TV personalty, and his shows achieved cult status among conspiracy theory communities.As he became better known, Jones started turning up, uninvited, at political conferences and public events, building up a network of fans throughout America.In 2007, one of these stunts ended in Jones being arrested for using a megaphone without a permit, but his cult status just kept on growing. Today, he says he has around 90 million regular listeners across all platforms.YouTube11 Jones' semi-hysterical rants have amassed millions of views all over the webMost of Jones' estimated £4 million net worth doesn't come from podcast downloads and YouTube clicks, though.Instead, two thirds of his income is thought to be a result of the Infowars store hosted on his website.Here, apocalypse-fearing fans can stock up on end-of-the-world essentials ranging from £550 body armour to toothbrushes, herbal body wash and diet supplements.Fans can also buy anti-radiation tablets (£15) , pistol holsters (£50), armoured rucksacks (£400) and Jones' own ""Patriot Blend, Wake Up America"" organic coffee beans (£14 a bag).He also sells ""Brain Force Plus"" pills - widely-mocked tablets which, Jones claims, will make you smarter and help you win ""the war for your mind"".AP:Associated Press11 The shock jock is thought to have a net worth of around £4 million11 Jones' son, Rex, has appeared on Infowars alongside himMost read in newsDYING WISH Single mum loses fight with cancer after asking family 'Look after my boys' ExclusiveROO'S FURY Wayne Rooney livid after bro filmed looking pally in pub loo with Tommy Robinson ZAPPED TO DEATH Toddler killed after putting phone charger in mouth while plugged into wall 'RAPE' RAP Oritse Williams' manager admits touching 'zombified' girl as 'star raped her' COT CLOTS Celebs' pics of babies sleeping in unsafe conditions 'fuelling cot death rise' WarningMOB JUSTICE Furious crowds strip female ‘shoplifters’ naked, batter them and cut their hair At the moment, with many of Jones' social media outlets suspended, the future of America's most controversial man looks uncertain.He is currently working on a book about his beliefs, The Secret History of the Modern World & the War for the Future, and is still broadcasting on Infowars.But many observers will be wondering whether the only war Alex Jones is really fighting might be a struggle against reality."

58,The sick anti-Semitic slurs that the Labour Party now thinks are OK,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6899631/the-sick-anti-semitic-slurs-that-the-labour-party-now-thinks-are-ok/,"1st August 2018, 9:35 am","LABOUR’S new watered down anti-Semitism code is providing loopholes for abuse to continue in the party - and sticks “two fingers up” at the Jewish community.MPs and Jewish activists are appalled over the party’s shambolic new rules, which don’t include the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition in full.Getty Images - Getty9 Labour's new rules on anti-Semitism could allow offensive comments to go unpunishedAnd yesterday Labour’s deep-rooted anti-Semitism storm reached new levels as a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn said the whole scandal was invented by “Jewish Trump fanatics”.Peter Willsman’s furious rant was caught on an audio recording - demanding evidence from 68 rabbis who had warned of sick hatred towards Jews within the Labour Party.Labour has insisted the new rules - which were approved and signed off on two weeks ago - do cover almost all of the internationally recognised definition - but “expands and contextualises” it.But MPs and members across the party say there are huge holes in it where people making offensive comments might not fall into their fudged definition of anti-Semitism.PA:Press Association9 Jewish MP Margaret Hodge is facing disciplinary action by Labour too for swearing at Jeremy Corbyn in a row over anti-SemitismComparing Israel to Nazi GermanyThe IRHA rules, which have been adopted by organisations and countries around the world, say it’s anti-Semitic to compare Israel to Nazi Germany, but Labour’s new code doesn’t explicitly say that.A long line of Labour councillors and other members of the party have been investigated for saying Israel is acting like the Nazis.Shamed former London Mayor Ken Livingstone, whose case the party put off ruling on for two years, was suspended for bringing the party into disrepute for making comparisons about the two groups.He said Adolf Hitler had “supported Zionism” when he first came to power in Nazi Germany - “before he went mad and killed six million Jews”. He later claimed Zionists had “collaborated” with Hitler.He denied his comments were anti-Semitic, and eventually quit the party.Lifelong mate Mr Corbyn said he was “sad” to see him go, despite his hugely offensive remarks.Reuters9 Ken Livingstone quit the party two years after talking about Hitler and the JewsLabour MP publicly brands Ken Livingstone a 'Nazi apologist' after Hitler zionism commentsBut he’s far from the only one trumpeting these views. Just last week Councillor Damien Enticott said: “Hitler would have the solution to the Israeli problem”.Enticott, who claims he was hacked, is currently under investigation and has been suspended from the party under the new rules.An Oxford councillor was also forced to resign over a Facebook post comparing Israelis to the Nazis earlier this year too.Labour's Ben Lloyd-Shogbesan posted two pictures, of Nazi Germany next to Israel, and the caption: “A picture worth a thousand words: on the left: Nazi Germany. On the right: Apartheid Israel.""He later said he regretted the postings and apologised - deleting the posts. Under the new code, however, he would seemingly be protected - although Labour today denied this would be the case.Miqdad Al-Nuaimi, a Welsh councillor, said that the Israeli regime and army were assuming the “genocidal character” of the Nazis, is another who could hide behind the new code.Al-Nuaime, who denied being anti-Semitic, was suspended over the comments.Rex Features9 Jeremy Corbyn is under more fire after the party's failure to not adopt a well-used definition of anti-SemitismDorian Bartley, a Labour diversity branch officer in Gipsy Hill was suspended in April posted a picture on Facebook of Hitler next to Israel’s President Netanyahu with the caption ""What’s the difference?"".He later apologised and admitted it was “offensive and wrong”.Nottingham councillor Ilyas Aziz was readmitted to the party after urging Jews to ""stop drinking Gaza's blood"" and compared Israel to Nazi Germany.Labour claim the Nazi comparison is dealt with in their new code, which says that “such language carries a strong risk of being regarded as prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party.”But it doesn’t say whether previous cases of comparing Israel to the Nazis would lead to a party investigation in future.Nasreen Khan, another Labour candidate for Bradford East, once wrote: ""What have the Jews done good in this world?.""She went on to add that school were ""brainwashing us and our children into thinking the bad guy was Hitler"" and added that ""Jews have reaped the rewards of playing victims"".Former Shrewsbury Mayor Ioan Jones is currently being investigated after comparing the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Hitler.Labour Councillor Ioan Jones shared this meme on Facebook comparing Israel to Nazi Germany. The same image got one of their party officers in London suspended earlier this year. pic.twitter.com/yRNK3UMGOw— John Johnston (@johnjohnstonmi) July 31, 2018He also reposted one about the Rothschilds, accusing them of financing wars and controlling the media. pic.twitter.com/I89RSXpJNF— John Johnston (@johnjohnstonmi) July 31, 2018The MP for Manchester Gorton Afzal Khan has also compared ""Israel to Nazis"", but Labour refused to discipline him.Labour says the Nazi comparison is dealt with in their new code, which says that “such language carries a strong risk of being regarded as prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party.”But it doesn’t say whether previous cases of comparing Israel to the Nazis would lead to a party investigation in future.Calling Israel a racist stateGetty - Contributor9 Seumas Milne, Mr Corbyns closest aide, has said Israel is a racist stateThe new code omits part of the international guidelines which says that it’s anti-Semitic to say that Israel’s very existence is a racist endeavour.Scottish Labour councillor Mary Lockhart was suspended this week for saying: “Israel is a racist state” among other abuse.Seumas Milne, Mr Corbyn’s own Director of Communications, has also claimed this in the past - writing Israel is a “racist state” in a Guardian article.He wrote in 2009: “The truth is that throughout the Arab, Muslim and wider developing worlds, the idea that Israel is a racist state is largely uncontroversial... This is a state, after all, created by European colonists, built on the ethnic cleansing of the indigenous population.”Activist Miko Peled was applauded by far-left supporters at a Labour fringe event last year, where he said Israel was a “racist settler colonial project”.Councillor Dipu Ahad was even allowed to compete for his seat at Newcastle Council in May despite previously saying on Facebook that he voted against a planning application for Marks & Spencer ""on principal"" because the store was “directly killing innocent Palestinian people by directly funding the Zionist regime”.The party says criticism against Israel is allowed - and the IHRA text could deny free speech to do so, which is why it doesn’t include the phrase “racist endeavour”.Claiming there is a Jewish 'conspiracy'Reuters9 Corbyn's leadership of the Labour party has been bogged down in claims of anti-SemitismAlso among typical anti-Semitic slurs is that there is some form of conspiracy controlling political and social outcomes, influenced by prominent Jews.In 2013 a Labour peer claimed that he was jailed because of a Jewish conspiracy.Lord Ahmed said that his sentence for texting shortly before his car was involved in a fatal crash came about from Jews who own newspapers and TV channels”.Simon Attwood, a council candidate for Kingston Upon Thames, has said he believes there is a global Jewish conspiracy ruling the British media. He has also claimed the MP John Mann is an ""agent"" of Israel.A senior Renfrewshire councillor was suspended but later reinstated after writing that the ""American Jewish lobby is extremely powerful and it has its boot on Obama’s neck"".She later added that the ""The King’s Speech"" won't win an Oscar as ""there is a powerful Jewish lobby campaigning against it"".Dorian Bartley, a UK Labour diversity officer, also shared a member on Facebook which suggested that there was an American-Jewish conspiracy funding ISIS.And Irfan Javed, a Labour candidate for Woodfield in Stevenage, stated in a rant about ""Jew propaganda"": ""I am just suspicious. This is what Jewish dominated western media usually does.""In the new Labour code, like the IHRA definition, it reads: ""making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions"".Margaret Hodge dubs Jeremy Corbyn a racist again over his failure to stamp out anti-SemitismAccusing Jews of being more loyal to Israel than their own countriesAnother common anti-Semitic trope used regularly by the far-left is claiming that Jews can’t be trusted as they are more loyal to Israel because they are Jewish.West Hendon councillor Adam Langleben forced the suspension of a woman in his ward who was running an anti-Semitic Twitter account that had included the comments: “Why are Israeli American citizens allowed to serve in the American government? Who are they loyal to?”Labour candidate Rebecca Gordon Nesbitt defended Ken Livingstone during his bizarre initial tirade, before claiming that Jewish MPs had ""Zionist sympathies"".She had run a think tank, however after her comments sparked controversy its website was deleted.Supporters of Jeremy Corbyn in Facebook groups spew anti-Semitic hatred like this - making comments like “you cannot serve two masters” and demanding that Labour expel friends of Israel because they “don’t have a shred of Labour values”.One wrote of Corbyn critics: “This begs the question of their objectivity and motive. All they have to do to refute is to condemn the slaughter in Gaza and illegal occupation of Palestine.”In the new Labour code it does not specifically state that being more loyal to Israel than their own nations, or that the creation of Israel is racist, is anti-Semitic - instead the code simply says this is “wrong”.Facebook9 In a Jeremy Corbyn supporters group it says Jewish people are 'serving two masters'Facebook9 Another said Jews were loyal to Israel and not LabourFacebook9 Activists repeatedly say that Israel is a racist stateBogged down in controversy with 250 allegations of anti-Semitism in just one weekThe party are currently probing hundreds of allegations of anti-Semitism from all across the party - and an extra 250 just in the last week.It is understood that the majority of those are not Labour members.After weeks of uproar from members of the party saying hateful comments could slip through the cracks, Labour finally agreed they would look at the code again. But any decisions won’t be made for months.Euan Philipps, spokesperson for Labour Against Antisemitism told The Sun: ""By removing these examples from the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, the Labour Party appear to have made it easier for racist members to stay in the party.“Now Corbyn and his supporters have removed this clarity it will be harder to define whether a member is anti-semitic.“That means racists in the party, many of whom are Corbyn supporters, will be allowed to remain in the party spreading their toxic and hateful prejudice.“We have a backlog of over 1,000 suspected members to report, many of whom have been promoting racist ideas and images redolent of the 1930s. How many of these will now get off with a slap on the wrist? It’s appalling.""Danny Stone, Director of the Anti-Semitism Policy Trust said Labour creating their own code was “very worrying”.He added: “Whatever the intention, it will act as a signal for people that some things might no longer be off limits when it comes to racially abusing Jews.”Critics said the process would certainly become much more blurred and confusing, and claim it is unclear whether what exactly would count as being anti-Semitic under Labour’s new rules.Key Jeremy Corbyn ally Peter Willsman reportedly says Labour’s anti-Semitism scandal was invented by ‘Jewish Trump fanatics’MOST READ IN POLITICSExclusiveSAJ'S MIGRATION BID Sajid Javid to scrap £30,000 minimum salary threshold for EU migrants ACID THREAT Nigel Farage should have had ACID thrown on him, Labour supporter says LatestSHAKEDOWN 'Radicalised Remainer' who threw £5.25 milkshake at Farage charged with assault 'TOO LATE' Ofcom slammed for waiting until THIRD death before launching reality show probe BORIS BOMBSHELL Boris Johnson is biggest threat to Jeremy Corbyn, Labour voters fear RevealedMILK MANIAC Nigel Farage milkshake attacker is a fanatical Remainer and Corbyn fan BOO WHAT?

62,Hugh Owens has won his divorce battle in the Supreme Court but he is a loser in love,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6882617/lorraine-kelly-opinion-hugh-owens-loser-love/,"27th July 2018, 10:24 pm","“MATE. It’s over. She doesn’t love you any more. Time to gather what’s left of your dignity and walk away.”All of the above is exactly what friends and family of Hugh Owens should have told him when his fed-up wife Tini wanted to call it a day and filed for divorce.PA:Press Association11 Determined... Hugh Owens has won a battle to stop his wife divorcing himInstead, 80-year-old Hugh has fought tooth and nail to hang on to the marriage, being dragged all the way to the Supreme Court, where this week a group of sombre legal eagles “reluctantly” declared that Tini would have to stay shackled to her husband.I simply cannot understand why anyone would be forced to use the full might of the law and spend a fortune on lawyers’ fees to escape a relationship that has so obviously shrivelled up and died. And still fail.Tini was desperate to get out of this marriage and move on with her life.PA11 Tini Owens has tried to free herself and even had an affairThe couple have been married for 40 years, have two grown-up children and enjoyed a successful business and extremely well-off lifestyle.Tini, a youthful-looking 68, fell out of love with her husband and filed for divorce three years ago.She had even had a fling, perhaps hoping that cheating would kill off her sickly marriage once and for all.No doubt to her frustration, Hugh forgave her for the affair and has repeatedly refused to acknowledge the marriage is over and done with, or to try to reach any sort of compromise.Now, you might think this is all because he is passionately in love with his wife and cannot bear to live without her.But it would appear the truth is somewhat different.SWNS:South West News Service11 Home is not where the heart is for Hugh and Tini OwensInstead of being distraught at the prospect of losing Tini, Hugh merely asserts that currently they “rub along” together and enjoy “pleasant” holidays.Perhaps that’s just his old- fashioned demeanour, but it seems a very buttoned-up way to sum up the reasons you want to stay with the person who has shared your bed and your life for four decades.Maybe they are THAT couple you see sitting in a restaurant with nothing to say to each other, while he is oblivious and she sits silently seething and slowly dying inside.I cannot imagine being stuck in such a soul-destroying relationship.But this surely can’t be just about love. It has to be about control.PA:Press Association/PA Images11 The Supreme Court has ruled the Owens' must stay togetherDutch-born Tini was 28 when she married 40-year-old Hugh in the late Seventies.I think we can guess what the balance of power was like in that partnership.Although the examples Tini has given of his behaviour were said to seem trivial in isolation, when you add them all up I’m surprised they stayed married for so long.Among the 27 that Tini listed, they included that he was “insensitive” in his “manner and tone” and she said she felt “constantly mistrusted” and unloved.Tini said: “The simple fact is that I have been desperately unhappy in our marriage for many years.“There is no prospect of reconciliation.”PA:Press Association11 Tini Owens actually lives in a separate building to her husbandShe said she felt “unloved, isolated and alone”.Even with the comfortable cushion of wealth, a gilded cage is still a prison.Tini is extremely lucky that they own more than one property, so she doesn’t have to stay under the same roof as her estranged husband.But without a divorce, she still isn’t free of him and will now have to wait a further two years to be legally able to divorce on the grounds of having lived separately for five years.No one really knows what goes on inside a marriage so a lot of this is speculation, but you do have to wonder why Hugh has dug his heels in so hard.Perhaps he was looking to the future and expected Tini to be taking care of him in his dotage, and that’s why he was willing to force her into court battles and public scrutiny.Tini was desperate to get out of this marriage and move on with her lifeLorraine KellyOpinionMaybe, in his own way, he really does love her. Who knows?Hugh has won this battle but ultimately will lose the war.In 24 months, and I’m sure she’s counting the days, his wife will be given her freedom.And this case might just trigger a long-overdue overhaul of divorce laws so couples don’t find themselves trapped in loveless, miserable marriages for years.MOST READ IN OPINIONCommentJANE MOORE Time for something completely different…let's put the boot in at EU elections CommentDAMIAN GREEN How Tory leadership race can lead to every Brit having a shot at the good life CommentALLY ROSS Graham Norton shouldn't have spared Madge's blushes as he lashed Eurovision acts CommentTHE SUN SAYS PM's desperate Brexit capitulation achieved nothing but alienating everyone CommentTHE SUN SAYS Hipster who threw MILKSHAKE achieved nothing but to recruit more Farage fans CommentNICK TIMOTHY Tinderbox Tories will get burned at the ballots - they need a new plan Rock's Tommy tributePA11 The rock remembers... haunting images displayed in Gibraltar were a reminderTHE haunting image of a soldier projected on to the Rock Of Gibraltar this week should make us all stop for a moment to remember the sacrifices of 100 years ago.World War One was an unimaginable bloodbath that killed 700,000 of the bravest and best Brit soldiers.The huge image of a soldier, bowing his head in solemn reflection, marks how vital a part the Gibraltar naval base played during World War One.As we approach the centenary in November of the signing of the Armistice that ended the conflict, expect to see more images like this all over Britain.Soldiers perform ten gun salute to mark the start of the Battle of Ypres and World War OneLife-sized “Tommy” statues will be in our town centres and village squares, and ten-inch versions will be sold to help raise funds for veterans and charities supporting the Armed Forces community.It’s a simple and poignant way for all of us to say thank you for their service and sacrifice.Big bother for MegGetty - Contributor11 Meghan Markle must wish her family would just stay out of the spotlightTHE Markle Clan are at it again. This time it involves the Duchess of Sussex’s future sister-in-law, arrested on suspicion of assaulting her fiancé Thomas, Meghan’s half-brother.These two have previous, with Darlene Blount, the blushing bride-to-be, arrested last New Year’s Eve after a drunken fight with her beloved.It’s all very Jeremy Kyle and I don’t think neither Thomas nor Darlene will be partaking of tea at the Palace any time soon.Splash News11 Darlene Blount was recently arrested againTo makes matters worse, there are strong rumours that Meghan’s harshest critic, her half-sister Samantha, is about to sign on the dotted line to appear in Celebrity Big Brother.Bear in mind that she recently implied that if their dad Thomas died, it would be all Meghan’s fault, and you get the gist of the kind of insults she’ll be spewing in the BB house.Meghan Markle's half-sister Samantha Markle defends 'cashing in' on Duchess' royal profile by discussing going on Celebrity Big BrotherI reckon this makes it all the more important for Meghan to build bridges with her estranged dad to try to dilute the toxicity of the rest of the brood.He might be the only one to knock some sense into his mouthy children and their extended dysfunctional family.Otherwise it’s all going to get even more uncomfortable for poor Meghan.Doggy don'tWHY are we still reading about police officers and concerned citizens having to smash car windows to rescue dogs in danger of dying in the heatwave?You should NEVER leave your dog alone in a car, even if you have parked in the shade and left the windows slightly open and it’s just a quick trip to the shops.The heat builds up like an oven and the horrible reality is that your pets will be roasted like a Christmas turkey – while they are still alive.If you don’t believe me then try sitting in your car wearing a fake fur coat with no air con and see how you get on after just 15 minutes.It’s beyond cruel and neglectful pet owners really need to start using their common sense.It's drag to richesSWNS:South West News Service11 Teachers at his school let Lewis Bailey downTHERE’S something deliciously karmic about talented teen Lewis Bailey having his dreams come true after his school banned him from performing in drag at their talent show.Without even seeing the 14-year-old’s act, teachers said it was “inappropriate”.If they had bothered to watch Lewis as Athena Heart, they would have realised there was no swearing or sexual innuendo.He was heartbroken to be banned but the backlash against this has given him a level of support and fame he can hardly believe.Rex Features11 Lewis appeared on TV in drag after his story emergedLewis has been on TV and radio, spoken to his idol Courtney Act and been invited to perform at DragWorld, Europe’s largest celebration of drag next month.Lewis and I both share a love of the glorious TV show RuPaul’s Drag Race, which is a funny, often painfully honest and ultimately uplifting drag extravaganza.His experience is uncannily similar to that of Jamie Campbell, who wanted to wear a dress to his school prom.His story is now the successful West End musical Everyone’s Talking About Jamie (which I’ve seen and can throughly recommend).I wish young Lewis similar success as he goes from being a drag princess to a fully fledged queen.Now give Mia moreAP:Associated Press11 Here we go again...

Edgar actually cried tears of happiness when the pregnancy test was positive.

Local businesses offered food, dresses and decorations and someone even offered to pay £400 for our wedding rings. The kindness of strangers was overwhelming.“Incredibly, within a couple of hours, we had over a thousand pounds, while someone bought our rings, and another sent flowers, and someone sent in a gold dress for me to wear. It was so heart-warming that people can be so kind at a time of such sadness.""Late at night, on June 30, the hospice called to say Edgar’s breathing had deteriorated and the wedding was now urgent.

Most neighbourhoods are divided on religious lines.While Israel's government and parliament are based in Jerusalem, the nation's economic and business centre is in Tel Aviv.Tel Aviv is also home to many foreign embassies including the UK's and, until May 2018, the USA's.4 Jerusalem has been at the heart of violent conflicts throughout historyWhy was there a UN vote and which countries voted against the UN resolution?The UN General Assembly held a rare emergency special session at the request of Arab and Muslim states, after Trump's shock decision heightened tensions in the Middle East.The resolution effectively called on the US to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and was backed by the overwhelming majority of members.A total of 128 countries voted for the resolution on December 21, 2017.Just nine voted no: the US and Israel, plus Guatemala, Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo.Thirty-five nations abstained, including Canada, Mexico and Australia, and 21 countries didn't turn up for the vote.The vote came after US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley issued a direct threat, saying that the US will think twice about funding the world body if it voted to condemn Trump's decision.She said: ""The United States will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in this assembly.""Haley said the US will put its embassy in Jerusalem regardless of the vote.Reuters4 Palestinians are burning pictures of Donald Trump in BethlehemWhy did Trump move the embassy and why is it so controversial?The new US embassy in Jerusalem opened with great fanfare on May 14, 2018.President Trump did not attend but sent a delegation to the ceremony including his daughter Ivanka Trump, her husband Jared Kushner, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan.In December 2017, announcing his ""long overdue"" decision, Trump said he was acting ""in the best interest of the US and the pursuit of peace"" in the region.The US is the first major country to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital since the Jewish state was created in 1948.The President slammed the stance of his predecessors, saying: ""We cannot solve our problems by repeating the same failed strategies of the past.""After more than two decades of wavers, we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement.""However, many world leaders condemned the move, with fears it could could spark further bloodshed in the region and disrupt attempts to reach a two-state solution.Theresa May reiterated the UK's support for continued negotiation, saying that she wants the two countries to have the city as a ""shared capital"".She said: ""We continue to support a two-state solution. We recognise the importance of Jerusalem.""Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Jerusalem was the ""eternal capital of the State of Palestine"".In a scathing rebuke, he described Trump’s speech as ""a declaration of withdrawal from the role the US has played in the peace process.""France's Emmanuel Macron called on the White House to step back from the announcement, while Pope Francis defended the ""status quo"" of the city as he prayed that ""wisdom and prudence prevail"".UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: ""From day one I have consistently spoken out against any unilateral measures that would jeopardise the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians.""The announcement sparked scenes of protest and flag-burning in Palestinian territories and across the Middle East.AFP or licensors4 Prince William at the Western or Wailing Wall in JerusalemWhy is Prince William caught up in a diplomatic row over Jerusalem's status?Prince William made the first ever official visit to the Holy Land by a member of the Royal Family in June 2018.He met dignitaries in Israel and Palestine during his goodwill mission.But a description of his itinerary prompted a diplomatic storm.Kensington Palace said a day ""in the Occupied Palestinian Territories will begin with a short briefing on the history and geography of Jerusalem's Old City from a viewing point at the Mount of Olives"".LATEST ON DONALD TRUMPGAS ATROCITY FEARS US warns Syria it WILL respond after 'signs' of deadly chemical attack CLASH OF THE TITANS Huawei boss warns ‘there will be conflict’ with US as spy row deepens PLAYING WITH FIRE Iran warns Trump is playing 'dangerous game' as Tehran snubs talks offer SPY IN THE SKY China-made drones for kids may be harvesting users' data, US warns TOUGH TALK Iran brands Trump ‘crazy’ for expecting nuke talks while ramping up sanctions HUA-WAIT UK delays Huawei 5G announcement until after Trump's state visit  Israel's Jerusalem Affairs Minister Ze'ev Elki accused Britain of ""politicising"" the royal visit.He said: ""United Jerusalem has been the capital of Israel for 3,000 years and no distortion in the tour itinerary can change that reality.""Kensington Palace declined to comment.Prince William met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, President of Israel Reuven Rivlin and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu.US President Donald Trump says, 'it is time to officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel' "
70,Sunderland lad bought mum’s three-bed council house – and mortgage is £1k a year cheaper than renting,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/6510980/sunderland-lad-bought-mums-three-bed-council-house-and-mortgage-is-1k-a-year-cheaper-than-renting/,"14th June 2018, 7:00 am","GETTING a foot on the property ladder feels like a distant dream for most of us.But it can be done, with the number of first-time buyers at a 10-year-high, according to UK Finance.North News and Pictures16 David Hider bought his council house with his mum through the Right to Buy schemeThat's why we've launched our new My First Home series where every week we speak to a different homeowner to find out what it really takes to finally get the keys to your own pad.Even though many first-time buyers are unpacking boxes into a new build thanks to the Help to Buy scheme, there are still plenty of homeowners who are picking up the keys to something older.And some don't even have to move out of the house they already live in, thanks to the Government's Right to Buy programme.More than 60,000 council-owned houses have been sold under the scheme in the past six years.We spoke to David Hider, 21, who bought his three-bed council house with his mum Tracey, 47, through this scheme earlier this year.It meant they didn't have to move out of their home in Sunderland where they've lived for 11 years - plus they now pay less in mortgage repayments than they did previously in rent.Here's how he did it.What's the house like and how much did you pay for it?It’s a three-bed terrace with a garden in Stanley, County Durham. The house is on a hill which overlooks open countryside and I live here with my mum, Tracey.We completed on the house in April and even though it was valued at £46,000 we only had to pay £34,288 as we had built up a really big Right to Buy discount over the years.North News and Pictures16 David and his mum Tracey have lived at the house for 11 yearsNorth News and Pictures16 The three-bed semi-detached home in SunderlandNorth News and Pictures16 The scheme meant that David and Tracey could get on the property ladder without having to moveWhy did you buy your existing home?We've lived in the house for 11 years and we are really happy here. There’s a real sense of community so we didn’t want to move away from the friends we've made.It was just really important to me – actually, to us both, to be on the housing ladder.It was really bothering me that we were paying all this rent each month to the council and had nothing to show for it.Are you a first-time buyer who want to share tips on how you did it? Email us at money@the-sun.co.uk or call 0207 78 24516. Don't forget to join the Sun Money's first-time buyer Facebook group for the latest tips on buying your first home. So once I got a permanent job - at a community interest garden centre in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear - I decided to start looking into how we could buy the house.I spoke to the council and we had to fill in some Right to Buy forms. They approved our application to buy - and confirmed the discount - so I just needed to go and find a mortgage.North News and Pictures16 The house was valued at £46,000 but they only had to pay £34,288 with the Right to Buy discountNorth News and Pictures16 High Street banks like Lloyds, TSB and Halifax told David they wouldn't lend to himNorth News and Pictures16 Not all lenders offer mortgages for 'pre-fab' homes because they are not sure what extra complications this kind of structure has for the futureNorth News and Pictures16 David and his mum had to get a specific Right to Buy mortgageWas it difficult to get a mortgage?At first I went to several high street banks, including Lloyds, TSB and Halifax. I went to each one in person to apply for a mortgage. But one by one they all said they wouldn’t be able to offer me a loan.There were a few complications too, which didn't help. Firstly, we needed a Right to Buy mortgage and secondly because I was in a reasonably new job I didn’t have much of an employment history.And my mum doesn’t have a job at the moment and is claiming Job Seekers Allowance, which isn’t recognised as an income by some lenders.What is Right to Buy?RIGHT to Buy was originally introduced by Margaret Thatcher through the Housing Act 1980.It allows eligible council tenants to buy their property at a discount.The rules are different for England, Wales and Northern Ireland.In all parts of the country, the discount is calculated according to how long you have lived there.In England you need to have lived in the house for three years and the rules allow you to make a joint application with someone who shares your tenancy.You get 35 per cent off a house (50 per cent off a flat) between three and five years.After five years, the discount goes up by 1 per cent (2 per cent for a flat) for every extra year you’ve been a tenant, up to a maximum of 70 per cent or £108,000 in London and £80,900 for the rest of England.In Wales you need to have lived at the property for at least five years and the discounts are the same but to a maximum of only £8,000. But, Right to Buy in Wales will end for all Council and housing association tenants on January 26, 2019.In Northern Ireland it’s a minimum of five years and the discount is 20%discount of the market value. The discount increases by 2% for each additional tenancy year to a maximum of 60% or £24,000 whichever is lower.Scotland abolished Right to Buy in 2016.And finally, the house we live in is a ""pre-fab"" [prefabricated homes were built in their hundreds to cope with the acute housing shortage after the Second World War. They come in pre-built parts instead of being built from scratch] which not all banks offer mortgages for. All the odds were against us.More on first-time buyingFULL HOUSE How I saved £32k for first house and wedding and STILL enjoyed nights out SAVVY SAVER Ditching nights out helps first-time buyer save extra £850 a month PENTHOUSE PAD Childhood pals clubbed together to buy £525k three-bed London flat HOME SWEET HOME Mum, 24 reveals how she bought £145k home after TWO years of saving BUYER BEWARE We nearly lost dream home due to mortgage adviser's error - and it cost us £4k FLY THE NEST First-time buyers, 32, spend 10 YEARS saving £40k deposit for one-bed flat HOME AND AWAY First-time buyer saved £17k deposit in a year by becoming a super scrimper HOME MOAN Map reveals where first-time buyers need to save for a DECADE for a house deposit 'I CAN'T SLEEP' Family devastated over new £242k Persimmon home with WONKY floors and walls HOME IN ON REALITY Millennials 'happy without a garden or garage to get on housing ladder' THE LONG GAME First-time buyer spent SEVEN years saving £62k deposit for four-bed house ROTTEN LUCK I got hit with £20k bill to fix damp and rot 18 months after moving in How did you manage to get a mortgage in the end?I searched online for companies that specialised in mortgages for people with unusual circumstances - and for those that offered Right to Buy loans for pre-fab homes.I came across a company called Together which said it was a specialist finance company for people with complicated financial circumstances which means that they may not qualify for a mortgage on the high street.That was exactly us.North News and Pictures16 David had to get help from a specialist finance company, Together, to help him get a mortgageNorth News and Pictures16 Tracey and David felt it was important for them to own their own homeNorth News and Pictures16 The spare bedroom is used for extra storage spaceI had to send about four months worth of bank statements - mum too - and other bits of paperwork like my employment contract and the small number of payslips I had.We also provided proof that we had never missed a rental payment in the 11 years we’ve been here. They came back with a ""yes"" after a few weeks.What size deposit did you pay and what mortgage did you get?We paid a deposit of £9,818. About half of it was given to us by my grandmother and my aunt to help us buy the house. I saved about £5,000 of it over a year.I’m not a particularly big spender and so at the end of every month I would just put whatever was left after bills and spending into a savings account.We then needed a mortgage of £24,470. We signed up to a five-year fixed rate mortgage at 7.12 per cent.Even though the rate is higher than standard mortgages on offer on the high street, the mortgage payments are much cheaper than rent. We are saving £90 amonth paying £264 compared to £354 a month in rent.North News and Pictures16 Being able to buy the house they had been living in for 11 years meant Tracey and David didnt have to pack up and leaveNorth News and Pictures16 Once David had got a permanent job he started to look in to what he needed to own his own homeNorth News and Pictures16 With help from family, David saved enough to put down the £9,000 needed for a depositNorth News and Pictures16 David says owning his own home has given him a sense of securityNorth News and Pictures16 David has no plans to move house again in the futureHow did you feel when you completed it?Mum and I are both really happy. Having somewhere that we can really call our own has given us a sense of security for the future.I don’t know anyone my age who has bought their own house. A lot of my mates are at university but when I started work, I knew that I wanted to buy my own home as an investment for the future for me and my mum.How do you get a mortgage under Right to Buy?GETTING a mortgage is not as straightforward as with buying any other home.Not all mortgage lenders offer Right to Buy mortgages so you need to do some shopping around.On the high street, Nationwide, Barclays, HSBC are among the banks and building societies that will look at Right to Buy. Certain specialist lenders such as Together and Precise Mortgages and Vida Homeloans will also consider them.Unlike standard applications, many lenders will not require you to put down a deposit for a Right to Buy purchase. The discount offered to you by the local authority can act as your deposit.However, the amount that you can borrow is calculated in the same way as any other mortgage and is based on your income and expenditure. So you will need to make sure you can afford the monthly repayments.When do you think you’ll move again?I’m not sure I’ll move again. It’s too much hassle and we’re very happy here. This is my home for life!What’s it like living with your mum?We get on really well so it’s great. She does all the housework and chores as I’m out working - so it works well.What help is out there for first-time buyers?GETTING on the property ladder can feel like a grim task but there are schemes out there to help first-time buyers own their own home.Help to Buy ISA - It's a tax-free savings account where for every £200 you save, the government will add an extra £50. But there's a maximum limit of £3,000 which is paid to your solicitor when you move.Help to Buy equity loan - The government will lend you up to 20 per cent of the home's value - or 40 per cent in London - after you've put down a five per cent deposit. The loan is on top of a normal mortgage but it can only be used to buy a new build property.Lifetime ISA - Another government scheme that gives anyone aged 18 to 39 the chance to save tax-free and get a bonus of up to £32,000 towards your first home. You can save up to £4,000 a year and the government will add 25 per cent on top.Shared ownership - Co-owning with a housing association means you can buy a part of the property and pay rent on the remaining amount. You can buy anything from 25 to 75 per cent of the property but you're restricted to specific ones.""First dibs"" in London - London Mayor Sadiq Khan is working on a scheme that will restrict sales of all new-build homes in the capital up to £350,000 to UK buyers for three months before any overseas marketing can take place.Starter Home Initiative - A government scheme that will see 200,000 new-build homes in England to be sold to first-time buyers with a 20 per cent discount by 2020.

I might not be here today. I saw Kris [Hallenga, the charity’s founder] on TV three years ago and her story inspired me to get to know my boobs. So when my left breast started to hurt last April, I went straight to my GP.Lancton41 Nurse Georgia Hope said she might not be here today without CoppaFeel!""The following month my worst fears were confirmed – I had breast cancer. I was devastated, but knew I had to fight it. Just 13 days later I underwent a lumpectomy, before six months of chemotherapy, which finished in October, and then I had a double mastectomy in November.""The chemo was so hard – I felt like I was going to die. At my lowest moments I couldn’t eat, sleep, drink or walk.It’s something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. That was just six months ago and I’ve since had the all-clear. I want to do this trek to give people going through their treatment hope that it will get better.”‘I want to turn my negative into a positive’Ana Snowdon, 47, is taking on the trek with her cousin, team leader Lisa Snowdon. She’s a business owner and lives in Sheffield with her husband Phil, 48, and daughters, Sofia, 10, and Elyse, seven.“Nothing can prepare you for hearing the words ‘breast cancer’ from your GP. When I was diagnosed in October, all I could think about was what it meant for my family. I couldn’t imagine not being there for my girls.Lancton41 Ana says doing the 46-mile trek will be tough, but it'll be worth it in the long run""My cancer journey isn’t over yet. I had a lumpectomy in November, but I’m still having chemotherapy and in June I’ll have a month of radiotherapy.""Doing a 46-mile trek just weeks later will be tough, but when Lisa said she was hiking across Transylvania as a team leader to raise money for CoppaFeel!, I jumped at the chance to join her.""It’s been something to look forward to during chemo and a way to show my daughters that cancer won’t change me. Lisa and I grew up together, so I know we’ll support each other every step of the way.”‘I’m trekking to make my Mum proud’Vicky Bennett, 24, is a support worker and lives in Crawley, West Sussex, with her fiancé Michael, 27.“When my mum Sharon was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2015, my heart broke. She’d always been my best friend and I couldn’t imagine life without her.Lancton41 Vicky Bennett, 24, is taking part in the trek to honour her mum after she was diagnosed with breast cancer""As a result of Mum’s diagnosis, I was tested for the BRCA2 gene mutation and found out in January 2016 that I was a carrier, meaning I’m more at risk of breast and ovarian cancer.""It was scary, but watching Mum battle her disease made me refuse to be a victim. Sadly, after two failed rounds of chemo, Mum passed away in March 2017, aged 56. I miss her every day.""Being at a greater risk of developing cancer does play on my mind – I might consider surgery to remove my breasts and ovaries when I’m older, and I stay extra vigilant for any symptoms.""This trek is totally out of my comfort zone, but it’s the perfect way to honour Mum. I know she’d be proud.”‘I never thought I’d live to see 40’Full-time mum Carrie Plumb, 39, lives in Essex with her husband Russell, 36, and children, Joseph, 13, and Lauren, eight.“Breast cancer knocked me off my feet in October 2015. I was on holiday in Croatia with my husband when I felt a lump in my neck, so I phoned my GP from the airport on the way home to book an appointment.Lancton41 Carrie Plumb, 39, says revealing her cancer diagnosis to her children was the hardest thing she had ever done""Within weeks I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer after doctors found a tiny cancerous tumour in my left breast that had spread to my neck.""I was told it was so small that I was lucky to have spotted it, but I didn’t feel lucky. Telling my children was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I never want to relive that moment.""After four months of chemotherapy and a mastectomy, I was given the all-clear in March 2016. Two years later, I’m getting back to myself.""People dread turning 40, but I can’t wait for my birthday in August. At one point I didn’t know if I’d even be here. Beating cancer gave me a new lease of life.”‘We battled cancer together – now we’ll conquer Transylvania!’Tazmin Clements, 19, is a student and is trekking with mum Josie MacEwan, a 48-year-old sales worker. They live in Wootton, Northampton, with Josie’s husband Chris, 43.Tazmin says:“When Mum told me she had breast cancer, I felt like the ground had gone from beneath my feet. We’d always been so close and I dreaded losing her.""At the time I was 15 and starting my GCSEs at school, but after Mum began chemo I was often in charge of running the house as my stepdad Chris works offshore. While my friends were going to the cinema and parties, I’d be cooking dinner, giving Mum her medication and doing the weekly shop.Lancton41 Tazmin Clements, 19, will be trekking with her mum, who has been diagnosed with breast cancer""Some days I’d have to miss school because Mum was so ill and I needed to look after her. It was a struggle, but we got through it together, and when Mum finished her treatment, I was proud of her for being so brave. We faced cancer as a team, and this trek will be our next adventure together.”Josie says: ""Being diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer left me speechless. It was February 2014 and I’d only found the lump five days earlier.""Seeing my daughter’s face when I got home from the hospital was devastating. Thankfully, I didn’t need to have a mastectomy, but I did have a lumpectomy later that month, followed by six roundsof chemotherapy and one month of radiotherapy.Lancton41 Josie can't wait to do the trekk with her daughter""I tried to keep life as normal as possible, but the chemo left me drained and I relied on Tazmin a lot.""She was my rock throughout the treatment and kept me going at my lowest moments – her strength gave me strength, and I can never thank her enough.""After everything we’ve been through together, a 46-mile hike will be a walk in the park! And I know that when things get tough, Tazmin will be by my side cheering me on.”Alamy41 Fabulous readers have previously marched he Great Wall Of China, but now it's time for a 46 mile Transylvanian Alps adventure'I know this trek is a fantastic opportunity to raise awareness'Amber Stevenson, 23, is an actuarial analyst from Swindon. “When my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, I thought ‘this is it’.

78,These time travellers say they’ve been to the future…and here’s their ‘proof’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5574774/time-travellers/,"16th April 2018, 11:45 am","NOAH claims he's a professional time-traveller who is stranded in 2019 - eleven years away from the year he belongs in, 2030.The nervous young man is terrified that, if he's not careful, he'll bump into a past version of himself and cause a paradox which could rip the universe to shreds.ApexTV13 A man calling himself 'Noah' claims he is a time-traveller from the year 2030Noah's not his real name, and he insists on blurring out his face and distorting his voice to hide from assassins who could off him as a punishment for revealing the ""truth"".Last year he even claimed to have passed a lie detector test, insisting that he's the real deal and not a sci-fi fantasist.""My 'natural time' is in the year 2030,"" he explains to Sun Online. ""That is the year all my family and friends are in. Simply put, I was fired from my job during a mission in the year 2017, which is why I am now stuck in 2019.""His story has more than a touch of Back To The Future to it, and sceptics have suggested that the classic 1985 flick could have inspired his claims.AP:Associated Press13 Time travel has been a national obsession ever since we fell in love with Back To The Future in 1985But Noah says he was a high school student when he learned from government agents that time travel was more than just science fiction.Supposedly, he was recruited into a top-secret program, and he went on to forge a successful career as a full-time traveller, based in 2030.Now he's become stranded in the wrong year.While he says he does have family in 2019, they wouldn't know or recognise the future version of himself - and meeting them could spark a chain reaction which could change the course of the future or destroy time itself.SUN13 The X-ray which Noah says shows a device in his hand that helps him to time travel""A past version of myself exists right now and he is in middle school currently,"" Noah says.""I have to stay far away from him to avoid causing a paradox, because the results of that could be profound, by what I understand.""Noah reckons he can prove he's telling the truth, with an X-ray which he says shows a device in his hand which helps him skip between time periods.He tells us: ""It was implanted before I went back in time via a surgical procedure. It was painless and that device actually helps in transporting all the atoms within my body. I'm not a scientist so I don't know all the details.""Paranormal Elite13 Noah's face isn't distorted as a result of the time travel - it's because he's chosen to stay anonymousSnaps from the future?Noah's story may sound insane, (his message to the many doubters out there is simply: ""I don't blame you."") but he's far from alone in making outlandish claims about time travel.Over on YouTube, he's just a drop in an ocean of self-described time-travellers, all with different stories to tell and their own ""proof"" to share with the world.Like Noah, many choose to appear anonymously, fearing repercussions from fellow time-benders who'd rather their secrets remained under wraps.Speaking to interviewers at an undisclosed location and with his voice disguised, one viral clip shows a man whip a smudged, slightly crumpled photo out from a pocket in his blue jacket.Man who claims to have been sent back from the year 6,000 shows 'photo proof'""This is a photo from the year 6000,"" he says. ""I don't know if you can see, but that's a city.""You may notice that the actual picture itself is a little distorted.""That is because in the time travel process, pictures tend to get distorted, as well as many other things.""Some people actually have parts of their body distorted by the time travel process.""ApexTV13 Speaking to ApexTV, an anonymous 'traveller' says he's seen life in the year 6000 - warning of a world featuring immensely powerful AIApexTV13 This photo, supposedly showing the city of the future, hasn't convinced too many people in the comment sectionIf the conveniently distorted photo isn't convincing enough to win you over, the man also has a warning of what lies ahead.""Artificial intelligence will be able to predict things with 100 per cent accuracy, and in the year 6000, we upload our brains to computers so we can live forever,"" he says.""They don't want me to tell you this.""'Time traveller' describes the scenes he saw in the year 2307A Greek man, also hiding his true identity, claims in another video that he spent two days in the year 3207 after being shot forward in time as part of a top-secret military programme.""The buildings were absolutely enormous,"" he says.""Cars were flying and there was strange coloured grass, not green but deep purple.""Aliens, ordinary people, big animals and robots were walking together.""But not all of YouTube's ""time-traveller"" community insists on remaining anonymous.In one popular clip, we're introduced to Alexander Smith, an American in a crumpled suit which looks like it just came out of a suitcase.It may well have, but he's not just got back from a business trip - he's home after a jaunt in the year 2118... and he says he can prove it.ApexTV13 Alexander Smith is one of the few YouTube 'time-travellers' who doesn't mind being namedApexTV13 His photo of a city in the year 2118 is blurry and warped - supposedly by the time-travel processHand shaking, the wacky character holds up a smudged photograph which appears to show a high-rise city centre, although it's difficult to tell.""This picture was taken in the year 2118,"" he says, without a flash of humour or self-doubt.In the same clip, he tells us what threats we face in the future, where he says he was sent as part of the (no longer) top-secret program which made him one of humanity's first ever time-travellers.""There's a danger of artificial intelligence taking over,"" he warns. ""But the number one threat to humanity as we know it is global warming.""Photograph 'taken by time traveller in 2118' supposedly shows a future cityThousands more like Alexander have cropped up on YouTube, the natural home for eccentric characters and conspiracy buffs.No doubt inspired by films like Back To The Future, these people (mostly men) are adamant that they don't belong in 2019, often breaking their supposed cover to warn us of the dangers lying ahead.The clip of Alexander showing off his ""evidence"" has racked up an impressive 500,000 views, while Noah's latest video has been seen by over 920,000.Great Scott! When Back To The Future came true...Time-travel classic Back To The Future may have missed the mark with the flying cars, but the film series has managed to get a whole lot right.The 1989 sequel is particularly notable for predicting the rise of hoverboards. Although they haven't taken off commercially just yet, car company Lexus has already made a real, working hoverboard prototype.Back To The Future II also showed us a world where kids can make calls and watch TV using VR headsets, tech which hit the market last year.In the same film, when Doc meets Marty by the clock tower, the mad scientist whips out what looks like a tablet computer.The flick has even managed to predict sporting results, suggesting the Chicago Cubs baseball team would win the World Series in 2015. This didn't quite come true, but the Cubs did win a year later in 2016 - against all odds.Writers have confirmed that film baddie Biff Tannen was ""loosely based"" on Donald Trump, so it's eerie that Biff branches out into politics in the popular film. Could Back To The Future have predicted President Trump?Time-travel TubeThe videos were shared on a popular YouTube channel called ApexTV, a paranormal network whose bread and butter is these self-professed time-travellers.Since it was founded in 2014, ApexTV has interviewed 28 alleged time-travellers, and now demand for their vids is so high that it takes a team of 11 people to staff the channel.An excited spokesperson for ApexTV told Sun Online: ""We have three more upcoming videos including one with a man who claims to have travelled 60 million years into the past and seen actual dinosaurs - as well as one with a woman who claims to have a selfie from the future.""We are pretty open minded and often share stories that a majority of people don't believe. We never give our opinions on the videos as we don't want to influence anyone else's.""ApexTV13 One anonymous woman claims this chip-like object is really tech from thousands of years in the futureAnother clip in the same ""time-traveller"" genre shows an anonymous woman, allegedly from the year 3780, showing off what she says is the actual technology she used to get here.She describes the artefact, which looks a bit like a big computer chip, as a ""skin"", although it's not really clear from her rambling anecdote what the tech is supposed to do.Fuelled by the rapid growth of internet conspiracy communities, a host of conspiracy YouTube channels can now give alleged time-travellers like her the kind of exposure that they could never have dreamed of ten years ago.Some say they can prove their claims, others don't bother trying to convince us but, either way, the clips go down a storm with conspiracy buffs and sci-fi enthusiasts.ApexTV's spokesperson added: ""Now, with anyone being able to share paranormal experiences online via YouTube and other platforms, we finally have an outlet that can potentially reach millions of people.""People's stories will no longer be kept secret, and that is the sole reason our channel exists.""​'​Time traveller from 2028' reveals what's around the corner in unnerving videoIs time-travel almost upon us?Obviously no - but a man who claimed to once work for the British government says it's ten years from becoming a reality.William Taylor said he was sent to the year 8973 in a secret time machine which will soon be released for public use.Speaking to ApexTV, he claims to have travelled to a future utopia free of disease and crime.And Taylor, who says he worked as an intelligence officer in the early 2000s, claims the government is keeping other technological advancements from the public too.ApexTV13 William Taylor claims to have travelled to the year 8973The first time-traveller?Ever since the internet took off, it's been a natural haven for conspiracy theorists, paranormal buffs and sci-fi geeks.And you can trace the net's rich history of time-travel tales all the way back to November 2, 2000.That's the date when a man, posting as John Titor, first surfaced in a niche corner of an online chat site claiming to have come here from the year 2036.A series of follow-up posts revealed that he had supposedly mounted a time machine in a car (ring any bells?) and shot back to our era for ""personal reasons"" after completing a mission back in 1975.13 Titor even uploaded a sketch of his organisation's logo to a conspiracy message boardTitor's claims captured the internet's imagination, and before long he had built up a cult following and had national radio appearances under his belt.A cult celebrity, Titor warned us what he'd seen in the future, claiming that 2015 would see a nuclear war between the US and Russia, and that his job is to shoot back in time to collect artefacts which can be used to rebuild the world.Over time he shared more of his story - including sketches of his time machine and his organisation's logo - and fielded more questions from his growing following.13 A man calling himself John Titor caused an international online stir after sharing diagrams of his time machine“Perhaps I should let you all in on a little secret,"" Titor wrote in his best-known outburst. ""No one likes you in the future.""This time period is looked at as being full of lazy, self-centred, civically ignorant sheep. Perhaps you should be less concerned about me and more concerned about that.”Documentaries were made about him, private investigators followed his trail, and message boards buzzed with hype around who this strange man could really be - and whether his morbid warnings of nuclear war would come true.Then, in March 2001, he vanished - never to be seen on any message boards again.Rex Features13 Back To The Future's time-hopping car may have inspired many people to claim they too were time-travellersIn the end, Titor was ""exposed"" by a PI as the creation of a Florida-based lawyer, who had even founded a company in Titor's name as part of the elaborate hoax.But even so, his story proved the internet's fixation with time-travel and paved the way for today's new generation of John Titors, inspired, no doubt, by sci-fi flicks like Back To The Future, where we encountered that iconic time machine car for the first time.most read in newsDYING WISH Single mum loses fight with cancer after asking family 'Look after my boys' ExclusiveROO'S FURY Wayne Rooney livid after bro filmed looking pally in pub loo with Tommy Robinson ZAPPED TO DEATH Toddler killed after putting phone charger in mouth while plugged into wall 'RAPE' RAP Oritse Williams' manager admits touching 'zombified' girl as 'star raped her' COT CLOTS Celebs' pics of babies sleeping in unsafe conditions 'fuelling cot death rise' WarningMOB JUSTICE Furious crowds strip female ‘shoplifters’ naked, batter them and cut their hair It's easy to have a dig at these characters and, down in the comment sections, many people do.Sceptics point out that the common belief among scientists is that if time travel were real we'd know about it, because someone would have come back and proven it to us.But what if this is the proof and ""John Titor"" was right all along: perhaps we ""lazy, ignorant sheep"" just aren't clued up enough to recognise it?"
79,What it’s like to die online: These chronically ill vloggers are turning to YouTube to share their lives – and deaths,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/6043819/cancer-vloggers-youtube-death-illness/,"13th April 2018, 4:09 pm","ELLIE Waters’ vlog looks like that of any other 14-year-old girl - she chats candidly to the camera in her messy bedroom, framed family photos on the shelves and a colourful line of nail polish within easy reach.But she’s not like any other teenager: she has cancer, and her YouTube channel is dedicated to charting her heart-breaking battle with the disease.14 Grinning Ellie looks just like any other teenager, but her life is far from ordinaryEllie, from Northamptonshire, was diagnosed in 2015, a fact she first shared online in a YouTube debut titled “My Cancer Story.”Her long brown locks have been stolen by chemo, and a tube disappears up her nostril, but Ellie doesn’t appear resentful or morose in the video, which has notched up nearly 300,000 views since it was uploaded in 2016.With one in two people expected to be diagnosed with some form of cancer, talking openly about the disease is nothing new.But now, you can also follow the unfiltered highs and lows of a cancer patient in real time at the click of a mouse, a development made possible by the rise of online vlogging.14 Ellie's open, frank approach to her health has given her vlogs a massive followingType “my cancer story” into YouTube and you’ll see she’s just one in a 13 million-long list of search results.For Ellie, who is now in remission, YouTube was a way of overcoming the isolation brought on by the illness.“During the cancer treatment I couldn’t go out, meet my friends or go to school,” she tells Sun Online. “With very little energy, YouTube became an enjoyable and easy hobby for me to do.”The positive reaction to her first clip spurred Ellie on to keep charting her journey through her vlogs, and her subsequent videos are full of frank insight and disarming humour.All the ups and downs are laid bare on YouTube: from her mum accidentally spilling her “chemo-wee” filled bedpans (much to the nurse’s horror) to Ellie’s difficulties readjusting to school life and coming to terms with infertility at 16.14 Ellie is now in remission, but has said that the vlogs helped her to come to terms with her cancer14 Ellie is one of many people documenting their illness online and gaining a huge support network in the processLess than a year to live: Emily Hayward, 24The trend has grown massively over the past few years, but sharing such an intimate and upsetting journey isn’t easy.It took Emily Hayward, from Bromley, a year to pluck up the courage to talk about her terminal melanoma on camera.The gym-honed 24-year-old’s clips were predominantly fitness videos in the past but nowadays she is more likely to film at Royal Marsden cancer hospital than her local gym.14 Emily, 24, has been given months to live - but that hasn't stopped her from making the most out of every possible momentThe former personal trainer is now seven years into a cancer battle that began with a mole on her calf.“From the calf, the cancer spread to my lymph nodes, then to my liver and lung, chest and up to the brain and down to my left hip, which is currently the biggest site,” she tells me, in the chatty, matter-of-fact tone you’ll hear on her videos.This tone persists, even when she casually revealed on camera last month that she has been given less than a year to live.14 Emily worked as a personal trainer before her diagnosis seven years agoFor the 24-year-old, life has become a whirlwind of hospital visits and wedding planning.Her vlogs seamlessly flit between shots of her and her fiancee, Aisha, in Nandos and the monotony of hospital waiting rooms.She shares everything from her “scanxiety” when waiting for results to shots of her undertaking radiotherapy, swallowing the dizzying cocktail of medication which has been keeping her alive.14 Emily is planning to marry her fiancee, Aisha, and vlogs openly about their relationship and the effects of her illness on the pairThe fitness fanatic has more than 20,000 subscribers, and finds strength in the positive reception her clips get.“I get a buzz from uploading a video,” she says. “The reaction makes you feel great, and motivates you to be well again the next day.“As the videos have gone on, I've become more and more like myself. It's actually changed me as a person.“I always knew that I was going to die young from cancer but maybe not this young, so we're still trying to maximise life”.14 Many people have been in touch with Emily to say that her vlogs have helped them come to terms with their own ill healthWhen watching her videos, it’s hard not be floored by her upbeat attitude and unwavering lust for life.Every upload is flooded with comments from people finding solace in her story, and vowing to live their lives more like her:“The other day a lady with cancer got in touch and said: ‘You’ve taught me how to die’. She was in a state of depression and said I’d helped her cope with it better.”14 Life is a whirlwind of hospital visits and wedding planning for Ellie and Aisha, who smile happily despite these exceptionally difficult circumstancesVlogger Emily Hayward determined to make the most of life following a terminal diagnosisRare tumour: Tabs Headington, 18With cyber bullying and the threat of an internet troll lurking behind every keyboard, it takes a brave soul to reveal what could potentially be their final months, weeks or days for the world to see.But for Tabs Headington, 18, who was diagnosed with synovial sarcomas, an aggressive type of cancer, uploading a vlog about her condition felt like the natural thing to do.14 Tabs decicded to channel her love of social media after receiving her diagnosisTabs, from the Isle of Wight, told us: “I have always been a sucker for social media, but obviously I didn’t expect it to turn out quite like this.”Now in remission, Tabs vlogs about her vegan lifestyle and recovery, but she has been told  by viewers to “get off her high horse” for promoting a plant-based diet - and not agreeing with everything her doctors told her.In response to her critics, she says, she would be in a very different place if she hadn’t done her own research: “My tumour was very rare and it was quite big at the time I got it removed, and because of the rarity we all decided it would be best to do integrated medicine.”14 Tabs is now in remission, and vlogs about the benefits of her plant-based lifetstyle, which has led to some controversyVlogger Tabs Headington's advice on what to do if you have been diagnosed with cancerSick bloggers in the StatesEarlier this year, popular YouTuber Mari Lopez died from the cancer she claimed had been cured by her vegan and raw plant based diet, suggesting that these inspirational videos can also be carriers of false hope and misinformation.In the US, views for cancer vlogs regularly reach into the millions.Talia Joy Castellano became an internet celebrity through her dynamic makeup tutorials and vlogs chronicling her battle with neuroblastoma, a rare pediatric cancer of the peripheral nerve system. She passed away in 2013, just a month before her 14th birthday. At the time of her death, her channel had more than 750,000 subscribers and 45 million video views. Even after her death, her Instagram feed @taliajoy18 has more than 1,000,000 followers.Living on borrowed time: Daniel Thomas, 32Comments haven’t always been kind to Daniel Thomas either.The 32-year-old, based in Weston-Super-Mare, was diagnosed with sarcomatoid carcinoma, an aggressive and very rare cancer, in 2015.14 Daniel Thomas was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer in 2015, and feels he is living on ""borrowed time""When he’s not pulling silly faces and cracking jokes at the lens, the mental and physical pain of a terminal outlook is obvious.“My original prognosis three years ago was four to six months,” he says.

I promise you – and the countless others who have lost their lives to cancer – we WILL continue to “do something” to make a difference. Your legacy will be that others won’t have to face what you didI admired her honesty, humour and totally got behind her ""f*ck you cancer"" attitude.She was so brave and graceful in dealing with her fate, and thought of others all the time.She got angry, and rightly so, at being let down by the system.The system that meant she was only diagnosed once the cancer had already spread to her liver.9 Selfishly losing Amy sent me into a downward spiral, questioning if I was watching my future play out before meThe system that lets you believe you're too young to have bowel cancer.Selflessly she shared her story, to persuade other people to DO something, to give blood - she was given transfusions during treatment - to raise awareness of the signs of bowel cancer, and to raise money to help beat the disease.Her goal, to ensure other people don't have to endure what she did.So Amy, here's my pledge to you:We stop saying people are too young to get bowel cancerFacebook / Team Amy9 Amy was just 32 when she died from the diseaseWhile under 50s are low risk, there is STILL a risk.Every year 2,500 people like Amy and myself are diagnosed before their 50th birthdays.It's essential doctors and nurses do not ignore or rule out the disease in their younger patients.DO SOMETHING Donate in Amy's memory and do your bit to help beat bowel cancer... hereAnd it's vital young people learn the signs and symptoms to watch out for.Bowel cancer in the under 50s is on the rise around the world, and it can't be ignored.We make sure everyone can name the signs of bowel cancerDeborah James9 Part of my pledge to Amy is to make sure everyone know the signs of bowel cancer - so we can catch this disease early when it's treatableThe five red-flag symptoms of bowel cancer include:bleeding from the back passage, or blood in your pooa change in your normal toilet habits - going more frequently for examplepain or a lump in your tummyextreme tirednesslosing weightTumours in the bowel typically bleed, which can cause a shortage of red blood cells, known as anaemia. It can cause tiredness and sometimes breathlessness.In some cases bowel cancer can block the bowel, this is known as a bowel obstruction.Other signs include:gripping pains in the abdomenfeeling bloatedconstipation and being unable to pass windbeing sickfeeling like you need to strain - like doing a number two - but after you've been to the looWhile these are all signs to watch out for, experts warn the most serious is noticing blood in your stools.But, they warn it can prove tricky for doctors to diagnose the disease, because in most cases these symptoms will be a sign of a less serious disease.We continue to fight for early diagnosisPA Real Life9 If it's caught early bowel cancer is a treatable disease, with a really high chance of surviving. When you get to stage four, like Amy and I, that chance drops off a cliffNearly everyone diagnosed in the early stages of this disease will survive.But this chance drops off a cliff as the disease progresses.Diagnosed at its earliest stage, 97 per cent of people with bowel cancer will survive their disease for five years or more.That's compared with just seven per cent diagnosed at the latest stage.We must make it a priority to improve first line testing to speed up diagnosis.Bowel cancer by numbers...42,000 - people are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year4 - it's the fourth most common form of cancer2 - and the second biggest cancer killer3,400 - the number of people diagnosed in April1,300 - people will lose their lives this month to the disease15,903 - lives will be lost this year to bowel cancer44 - people die every day30 - that's one bowel cancer patient every 30 minutes15 - every 15 minutes someone is told they have bowel cancer97 - 97 per cent of people diagnosed in the earliest stages will survive for five years or more7 - only seven per cent survive when diangnosed at the latest stage60 - 83 per cent of people who get bowel cancer are over the age of 6050 - it's more common over the age of 50 but ANYONE can get bowel cancer, you're never too young2,500 - the number of under 50s diagnosed each year268,000 - people living with bowel cancer in the UK We continue to develop bespoke services for young cancer patientsServices and info needs to be better.It needs to be aimed at young patients, to address issues that young patients will face, like fertility, sex, relationships and body image.We raise vital funds to ensure we can tell cancer to f*ck off even harderResearch is essential if we are to help cancer patients live longer and better lives.We can all do our bit to raise money to make sure that the whizz kid scientists out there in their labs can crack new treatments, and find new ways of beating this awful disease.MORE THINGS CANCER MADE ME SAYCommentDEBORAH JAMES Before cancer I was never happy with my body... now I couldn't love it more CommentDEBORAH JAMES Cancer hurts like hell but breathing (yes breathing) is helping me cope DEBORAH JAMES There's no such thing as a 'normal' vagina - believing the myth is killing us CommentDEBORAH JAMES Don't let it happen to you... the bowel cancer signs I wish I'd known earlier CommentDEBORAH JAMES I love carbs & turns out eating more can help beat bowel cancer!

Once you have that rigid ideology, it forks you down a certain road.""If you hate America and you hate Western liberal values, you hate Israel. And you completely blur the lines between Israel and Jews.""6 A conspiracy theory spread on a Labour supporters group on Facebook which Mr Corbyn was inANTI-SOCIAL MEDIAThe rise of the internet makes it easier for vile views to spread and catch on with naive web users.It also makes antisemitic comments more visible to ordinary people, moving them from the shadows to popular platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.That’s one way Mr Corbyn has been caught out - he was a member of three groups on Facebook which were set up to connect Labour activists, but ended up being hijacked by antisemites.Mr Arkush recently told The Sun some left-wingers are drawn into antisemitism through online communities where bigots prey on them by making Jew hatred seem normal.MOST READ IN POLITICSExclusiveSAJ'S MIGRATION BID Sajid Javid to scrap £30,000 minimum salary threshold for EU migrants ACID THREAT Nigel Farage should have had ACID thrown on him, Labour supporter says 'TOO LATE' Ofcom slammed for waiting until THIRD death before launching reality show probe LatestSHAKEDOWN 'Radicalised Remainer' who threw £5.25 milkshake at Farage charged with assault BORIS BOMBSHELL Boris Johnson is biggest threat to Jeremy Corbyn, Labour voters fear RevealedMILK MANIAC Nigel Farage milkshake attacker is a fanatical Remainer and Corbyn fan He said: ""You choose your social media to reflect back what you believe in - you follow things that reflect your far-left views and you end up liking things that should never have been there.""He pointed to the case of Naz Shah, who admitted she had shared unacceptable comments calling for Israel to be relocated to America after coming across them online.But the web can also be used to combat hatred of Jews - yesterday’s rally in Parliament Square was partly organised by spreading the word online, bringing together a huge crowd with just 24 hours’ notice.Time to start following your own rules and drive out Jew hatred, Mr CorbynDANNY STONE, director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust, describes how the recent flare-up of antisemitism reminds him of the vile student politics he experienced more than a decade ago.In 2005 I stood at the National Union Students conference as Luciana Berger (now a Labour MP) gave an excoriating speech condemning the NUS for its failure to take action on anti-Jewish hatred.At that event, a leaflet was readily available which drew on the age-old forgery, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a dangerous conspiracy theory which describes the Jews as plotters seeking to rule the world.The failure to understand Jewish student suffering from sections of the student left was palpable.It's just the NUS, I thought. Student politics has always been “radical”. I couldn't have realised then that it was to be a harbinger of future pain.Fast forward more than a decade. It has been almost two years since Labour ran an inquiry into antisemitism. The vast majority of its recommendations remain unimplemented.No less than three shadow ministers have trotted out or shared messages that the latest concerns raised by the Jewish community are smears – I fear this is not coincidental.The Labour party still doesn’t appear to have a handle on how many incidents reported to it have been actioned, rejected, or are in progress. More than a decade on from that student conference I attended - and this section of the left has learned nothing about antisemitism.At the latest epicentre, a row over a mural. A picture painted on a wall in East London, with a Masonic pyramid above elderly white men - the Jews with large hooked noses - playing Monopoly on the backs of the workers.But it isn’t just about one incident. At the Labour conference, a Marxist newspaper was handed out which quoted top Nazi official Reinhard Heydrich as a supposedly reliable source of information about the Holocaust.Councillors, MPs, party members and others have been suspended for calling the Holocaust a hoax, abuse of a Jewish journalist, conspiracy theories about “Jewish control”, attacking Jews with the antisemitic “ZioNazi” slur and much more besides.Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow team need to understand this better. Racism tends to treat its victims as primitive, lowly, inhumane or worthless - however, antisemitism can portray Jews as cunning, manipulative, and all-powerful liars.In such a polarised, angry environment, allegations of antisemitism aren’t given the serious consideration they deserve and those that perceive themselves as victims are not offered sensitivity and respect they deserve.That is a failure to abide by the terms of Labour’s own Chakrabarti report and the standards we as a country set for handling and addressing racial hatred.Put simply, the Labour party needs to start abiding by its own Terms of Service - that applies to Jeremy Corbyn as much as anyone else."
86,Jeremy Corbyn is a ‘poster boy for antisemitism’ says top Labour MP as leader FINALLY says sorry for supporting vile mural,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5900120/jeremy-corbyn-apology-antisemitism-labour-mural/,"26th March 2018, 9:04 am","JEREMY Corbyn is ""the poster boy of anti-Semites everywhere"", a top Labour MP sensationally claimed today, as the party boss finally apologised for supporting an offensive mural.The extraordinary blast came as hundreds of protesters - and dozens of Labour and Tory MPs - descended on Westminster this evening to protest against his handling of anti-Semitism within the party, and he was found to be inside a THIRD group riddled with anti-Jew hate.Paul Edwards - The Sun7 Corbyn says he 'deeply regrets' commenting in support of an anti-Semitic mural in 2012Margaret Hodge MP said today that she was ""deeply offended"" by what seemed to be ""persistent and pervasive anti-Semitism"" in and around the Labour Party, and urged him to dissociate himself from the offensive thugs posting disgusting content. Jewish man expresses his anger as the tensions build at anti-semitism March in Westminster On Facebook the MP for Barking said: ""This is not the new politics"" and deemed the Chakrabarti Report as ""a failure"".""We now have to seriously reconsider holding another inquiry but this time headed by a person – not necessarily themselves Jewish – who the Jewish community can have faith in to take the problem of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party seriously.""But finally the Labour boss issued a grovelling apology to Jewish leaders, saying he was personally sorry for supporting an anti-Semitic mural on Facebook.7 This screenshot shows Jeremy Corbyn commenting on a mural that was deemed to be anti-SemiticHe sent a letter promising to Jewish leaders promising to ""always be your ally in the fight against anti-Semitism"" after they deemed him a ""figurehead"" for conspiracy theories and fake news earlier today.He was accused of viewing Jewish people as a ""hostile entity and a class enemy"" by livid community leaders.Mr Corbyn described anti-Semitism as an ""evil"" and admitted that the party dismissed it often as ""a matter of a few bad apples"".""I am sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused, and pledge to redouble my efforts to bring this anxiety to an end.""There needs to be a deeper understanding of what constitutes antisemitism in the labour movement.""Sometimes this evil takes familiar forms – the east London mural which has caused such understandable controversy is an example.""The idea of Jewish bankers and capitalists exploiting the workers of the world is an old antisemitic conspiracy theory.""This was long ago, and rightly, described as “the socialism of fools.”  I am sorry for not having studied the content of the mural more closely before wrongly questioning its removal in 2012.""Jeremy Corbyn letter to Jewish leadersWriting to the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership CouncilDear Jonathan and Jonathan, Thank you for your letter to the Labour Party concerning antisemitism issued as a press statement last night. First of all, let me acknowledge the anger and upset that provoked it, and repeat my offer of an urgent meeting to discuss the issues you have raised as soon as possible. I stated yesterday, and repeat today, that I will not tolerate any form of antisemitism that exists in or around our party and movement.  I am committed to eliminating antisemitism wherever it exists. As I told the Labour Party conference in 2016, antisemitism is an evil that led to the worst crimes of the 20th century. Prejudice and hatred of Jewish people has no place whatsoever in the Labour Party, and every one of us has a responsibility to ensure it is never allowed to fester in our society again. I recognise that antisemitism has surfaced within the Labour Party, and has too often been dismissed as simply a matter of a few bad apples. This has caused pain and hurt to Jewish members of our Party and to the wider Jewish community in Britain.  I am sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused, and pledge to redouble my efforts to bring this anxiety to an end. While the forms of antisemitism expressed on the far Right of politics are easily detectable, such as Holocaust denial, there needs to be a deeper understanding of what constitutes antisemitism in the labour movement.  Sometimes this evil takes familiar forms – the east London mural which has caused such understandable controversy is an example.  The idea of Jewish bankers and capitalists exploiting the workers of the world is an old antisemitic conspiracy theory. This was long ago, and rightly, described as “the socialism of fools.”  I am sorry for not having studied the content of the mural more closely before wrongly questioning its removal in 2012.Newer forms of antisemitism have been woven into criticism of Israeli governments. Criticism of Israel, particularly in relation to the continuing dispossession of the Palestinian people, cannot be avoided. Nevertheless, comparing Israel or the actions of Israeli governments to the Nazis, attributing criticisms of Israel to Jewish characteristics or to Jewish people in general and using abusive phraseology about supporters of Israel such as “Zio” all constitute aspects of contemporary antisemitism. And Jewish people must not be held responsible or accountable for the actions of the Israeli government. The Labour Party has always opposed antisemitism, old and new, and always will.  We are proud of our deep historical links with Jewish communities, and to have fought alongside generations of Jewish men and women against fascism, prejudice and discrimination. This is a part of our common heritage from which we will never be separated.  But I acknowledge that antisemitic attitudes have surfaced more often in our ranks in recent years, and that the Party has been too slow in processing some of the cases that have emerged. Early action has nevertheless been taken, and we will work to speed up procedures, to deal with cases of antisemitic abuse or attitudes. I am committed to making our Party a welcoming and secure place for Jewish people. Zero tolerance for antisemites means what it says, and the Party will proceed in that spirit. That demands among other things the overdue full implementation of the recommendations of the Chakrabarti report, including a programme of political education to increase awareness and understanding of all forms of antisemitism. The battle against antisemitism should never become a party political issue.  It must unite all of us if we are both to honour the memory of the victims of the bestial crimes of the 20th century and build a future of equality and justice for all. In that spirit, I must make it clear that I will never be anything other than a militant opponent of antisemitism. In this fight, I am your ally and always will be. Best wishes, Jeremy Corbyn MPLeader of the Labour Party7 A message posted on a Facebook group which Jeremy Corbyn is a member of7 The group hosts conspiracy theories about Jewish peopleToday the party leader's own MPs have joined to deal with the problem of anti-Semitism in his party and refusal to apologise for his own support of offensive artwork.The Campaign Against Anti-Semitism separately branded Labour “racist” and said it had filed a disciplinary complaint about Mr Corbyn with the party.It followed the Labour leader’s admission late last week that in 2012 he had defended a horrific mural in east London that depicted Jewish bankers playing monopoly on the backs of the poor.This morning, it emerged that Mr Corbyn has for seven years been a member of a Facebook group which is used by some members to spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and slurs.The group called ""The Labour Party Supporter"", which Mr Corbyn joined himself rather than being added to it, features multiple posts which promote conspiracies about wealthy Jews running the world.More recently, members of the group claimed that ISIS and Israel were jointly responsible for the nerve gas attack on ex-spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury.Mr Corbyn's office did not respond to a request for a comment.Facebook7 The painting was done on a wall in East London in 2012Facebook/Jeremy Corbyn7 The Labour leader's message on Facebook last nightToday Jonathan Goldstein, Chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, told the BBC that ""the time for words is over, the time for action is now"".He told Radio 4: ""Wherever we go we are told that we are acting on behalf of Israel, that Rothschilds run the world, that Isis is a front for Israel... that Zionists are the new Nazis...""This is the first time in my lifetime that the Jewish community has felt the need to take to the streets to campaign against he leader of a major political party.""Rightly or wrongly he is now the figurehead for an antisemitic political culture based on obsessive hatred of Israel, conspiracy theories and fake news. ""That is doing great harm not just to the Labour party but to Britain.""And Karen Pollock of the Holocaust Educational Trust stormed: ""Antisemitism is a threat to society. To all of us. If we do nothing and leave it unchallenged, we know what this hatred can ultimately lead to. Leaders must take a strong, clear, irrefutable stand.""She called Mr Corbyn's actions ""disturbing"" and ""unforgivable"".Jonathan Arkush, Board of Deputies of British Jews, added: ""Everything with Jeremy Corbyn is, well I hear no evil, I see no evil, I wasn’t looking, I didn’t say anything. Frankly, That strains my credulity.""Tonight the leftie boss' own MPs will join a protest against him in Westminster.Bassetlaw MP John Mann said today: ""The Labour Party ceases to have a reason for existence if it cannot stand up against discrimination and racism. Tonight every Labour MP and member should stand in solidarity with the Jewish community.""And when questioned, he said he ""doesn't know"" whether his leader is anti-Semitic.Tory MPs including Nick Boles and Robert Halfon are set to go too.But a group calling themselves 'Free Speech on Israel' is set to oppose the rally.They say there is ""cynical selective outrage"" and Jewish leaders oppose Jeremy's socialist vision for Britain.They say that community leaders should ""stop playing party politics"".A truly terrible day when @BoardofDeputies & @JLC_uk feel the need to write such a letter.

Corbyn opposes his extradition and invites him for tea at the Commons.”They added: “Again and again, Jeremy Corbyn has sided with anti-Semites rather than Jews.""At best, this derives from the far left’s obsessive hatred of Zionism, Zionists and Israel.""At worst, it suggests a conspiratorial worldview in which mainstream Jewish communities are believed to be a hostile entity, a class enemy.”Last week Mr Corbyn was found to be a member of a second Facebook group which shared anti-Semitic comments.Members shared articles saying that half of Israeli Jews ""believe in ethnic cleansing"" and in support of Labour Party members who were kicked out for anti-Semitic allegations.Facebook7 Members of the group have shared messages from Jackie Walker - who was suspended from the Labour Party for antisemitic comments about Jews financing the slave tradeSick Corbynistas say Jeremy Corbyn's anti-Semitism allegations a 'smear' and take to Twitter to 'predict' the next oneLEFTIES online are taking to Twitter to try and ""predict"" the next thing the media will try to ""smear"" Jeremy Corbyn with.Using the hashtag #PredictTheNextCorbynSmear, users are saying that accusations of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party are just attempts to discredit him.One wrote: ""Smears against Corbyn saying he is anti semitic are lies.

89,What it’s like to be told your newborn has Down’s Syndrome,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/5798305/newborn-downs-syndrome/,"19th March 2018, 7:29 am","WHEN an elderly man stopped to coo over her newborn baby in the supermarket, Ellie Martin was beaming with pride. Yet as he turned to walk away, he blurted out: “I don’t envy you, love. He’s cute now but it’s going to be bloody awful when he grows up.”19 Henry Martin has Down's SyndromeThis casual but cruel remark was triggered by little Henry having Down’s Syndrome. Ellie, 35, an events organiser living in Kingston, London, was so taken aback by the hurtful outburst, she was reduced to tears. “I had to quickly push Henry round the corner to have a sob by the soup aisle,” she says.Ellie, who was just seven months into motherhood, says she was already feeling defensive about her son’s condition at the time.19 Tom, Henry and Ellie Martin enjoying family life“I’d be walking around town feeling that everyone was looking at him, staring at his differences.“It wasn’t until I had my second son, who doesn’t have Down’s, and realised that everyone looked at him too – that’s just what people do, they look in buggies.”19 Henry's mum Ellie used to worry people were only looking to see his differencesBut that day in Asda was the first time she’d had to deal with outright bigotry about Down’s.   Ellie, and IT manager husband Tom, 34, didn’t know Henry would be born with Down’s. It wasn’t detected by the routine test at around 12 weeks into pregnancy - though even if it had been, Ellie says she and Tom wouldn’t have terminated.19 While Henry's heart anomalies were picked up during Ellie's pregnancy, Down's Syndrome wasn't“Some heart anomalies were picked up at our 20-week scan so we were having regular checks to keep an eye on them,” says Ellie.“I had briefly linked the idea of a poorly heart and DS in my mind but quickly dismissed it. We were having very regular scans and assumed Down’s Syndrome was something that was always picked up on right? But no.”Sudden arrivalHenry arrived five weeks early in April 2013. Just an hour after his birth, Ellie recounts the doctor taking him away to do some heart checks but when he returned, he had some very different news. His words were: “I’m very sorry to say we think your son has Down’s Syndrome.""19 Henry was born five weeks early at Kingston Hospital in 2013Ellie says: “I remember looking straight down at Henry and the little telltale features that had been so apparent to the medics became obvious to me too – his beautiful almond shaped eyes, his little button nose and his low-set ears.”She asked the doctors to leave the new family alone, just the three of them. “I don’t know why but I felt really in control, really strong. They left and my husband broke down. I remember lifting up his head and just looking at him, saying, ‘This is us Tom, me and you, we’ll be fine. He’s our son. Look at him. He’s amazing’.”Ellie says she’s unsure where that composure came from at the very beginning. “It definitely wobbled over the coming days and weeks, but I just knew I loved him so unconditionally.”19 Henry's almond shaped eyes, little button nose and low-set ears were telltale signs of Down's Syndrome to the medicsTom went home that evening, leaving Ellie alone with Henry for the first time.“Tom stayed up all night searching on the internet for articles, blogs, advice, support. Trying to get the tools together to help us start our new life.“I, on the other hand, lay in my hospital bed all night, awake, staring at Henry, with the same sentence going through my head. ‘My son has Down’s Syndrome’. It was neither negative or positive. But it was constant.”The next day Henry’s health deteriorated. He had stopped feeding, still hadn’t done his first poo, had turned jaundiced and started vomiting.The doctors suspected Hirschsprung's disease, a condition where part of the bowel doesn’t work so everything gets blocked and often requires surgery.They rushed him to St George’s Hospital in Tooting, six miles away from where they were at Kingston Hospital. There they would confirm the condition and have to operate in a couple of months’ time.What is Down's SyndromeDown’s syndrome is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome in a baby’s cells.In the majority of cases, Down’s syndrome is not an inherited condition.It usually occurs because of a chance happening at the time of conception.As of yet we do not know what causes the presence of an extra chromosome 21.It can come from either the mother or the father.There is no way of predicting whether a person is more or less likely to make an egg or sperm with 24 chromosomes.There is a definite link with advanced maternal age for reasons yet unknown. However most babies with Down’s syndrome are born to women under the age of 35, as younger women have higher fertility rates.What we do know is that no one is to blame. Nothing done before or during pregnancy can cause Down’s syndrome. It occurs in all races, social classes and in all countries throughout the world. It can happen to anyone.Source: The Down's Syndrome Association“The next few days passed in an extremely emotional blur. It was hard, very hard, but day by day he got stronger.”Ellie says that as horrendous as it was at the time, Henry getting so poorly allowed the couple to get over the news of him having DS very quickly. “The whole aspect of learning difficulties and slower development became so insignificant when our little boy was strapped up to every monitor imaginable in ICU.”  Henry's armyEllie and Tom’s families’ reaction to Henry’s condition were a great source of strength to them during this heart-wrenching time. “His new grandparents were incredible. I rang my parents. I told them we’d had some really sad news, that their tenth grandchild had Down’s.“My mum was as pragmatic as ever. She said ‘ok darling. Don’t worry. We’re on our way’. And that was that. She came in, swept him up into her arms and had the same reaction as she did with her previous nine grandchildren. Big fat tears of joy.19 Grandma Angela Spreckley's first cuddle with Henry, her tenth grandchild“Tom’s mum was just the same. She walked into the room and said “where’s my grandson?”, scooping him up and holding him close.”19 Granny Pam Martin was thrilled to meet her first grandchildBut one of Ellie’s sisters completely broke down on hearing the news. “She’s honest in saying that she was totally devastated. She was scared for us, for him and so fearful of what the future held.”She and the rest of Ellie’s siblings sat their own children down to explain about their new cousin Henry, showing them pictures of other children with Down’s Syndrome and talking them through some basic facts. “A classic response from my nephew, who was six at the time, was ‘oh yeah, I see lots of people with Down’s Syndrome on Mr Tumble.”Heads upHowever, Ellie does wish she’d found out about her son’s Down’s Syndrome during her pregnancy. “On a weekly basis I get asked by someone ‘did you know?’. When I reply with a ‘no we didn’t’, I get a look. One that says  ‘ahh that’s why’. I hate that I’m not able to defend my son and say ‘yes we did know. We chose to keep him’. “Henry has made our lives richer, fuller and in many ways so much simpler. Without even being aware, our family priorities have shifted and we are so less concerned about the ultimately insignificant things in life.19 Ellie and Henry don't let Down's Syndrome get in the way of having fun“Of course not everything is rosy. There are things which are harder for him, and for us and there are times when I’ve felt worried about him and his future. But even this has made our family stronger. We’re a rock solid team.”19 Henry loves to be out and about with dad TomGet with the timesThinking back to that upsetting day in Asda almost five years ago, Ellie wishes she’d been able to answer back with all the wonderful things that she’s learnt about having a child with Down’s Syndrome. “I would have explained to him that his knowledge and understanding of DS was extremely outdated and completely unjustified. I would have explained how people with DS have very exciting futures now that the correct help and support is offered to them from such an early age. And how actually, even if the future did have difficulties, we'd cope, because we love him!19 Henry is a water baby and loves the sea, swimming and piratesFive years on. Ellie’s sister’s concerns have thankfully proved baseless and she knows now that her shock and upset was purely down to a lack of knowledge of the condition and assumptions from years gone by.“She sees Henry and simply laughs about the idea of feeling fearful and sad when all he is, mainly, is a big whirlwind of joy,” says Ellie.Life and soulToday, Henry is just as cute as he was back on that upsetting day in the supermarket, and he’s smart, funny and loving.19 Henry as the bear from We're Going on a Bear Hunt on World Book DayAfter all, children with Down’s Syndrome have more in common with all other children than differences. Henry is a typical four-year-old, who loves pirates, swimming and Legoland.19 Henry loves Lego and had a blast at Legoland last year19 Ready for his first day of primary schoolHe goes to a local primary school in Kingston, where he’s learning to read alongside the rest of his peers.He’s adored by his mum and dad, and is a huge source of entertainment and fun for his two younger siblings, Wilfred, 3, and Beatrix, 1. Friends and family say he charms everyone he meets.19 The Martin brothers, Henry and Wilfred, are best friends19 One-year-old Beatrix is never far from the action with Wilfred and HenrySocial network“Having Henry brought our lives into a whole new social network - not just the Down’s Syndrome community but a much wider special needs one. Our early weeks and months were helped so much by our local parent-run group 21&Co. “Henry has brought people into my life that have truly become some of my best friends – people who not only understand some of the difficulties we face and challenges we deal with but who ultimately, whether it’s because of shared experiences or not, have the same outlook on life as us, and for that we feel so blessed.”Bright future While Ellie and Tom try to take each year at a time, they often daydream about what Henry’s future may hold.  19 The Martin family are a rock-solid team, says mum Ellie“I’ve imagined him having a good level of independence, working at a garden centre - mainly because his dad is such an avid grower - or at a cinema, as he loves TV. “I’ve imagined him being out with his friends at discos and parties and having a girlfriend.“But all that aside, we genuinely just want him to have the support he needs around him, to be happy, to have friends and to feel a sense of worth. That’s really all that’s important in life, right?”Henry having Down’s Syndrome clearly didn’t deter Ellie and Tom from having more children - and they decided not to screen for the condition in those pregnancies.19 Three in a bed leave little room for mummy and daddyMOST READ IN NEWSDYING WISH Single mum loses fight with cancer after asking family 'Look after my boys' ExclusiveROO'S FURY Wayne Rooney livid after bro filmed looking pally in pub loo with Tommy Robinson ZAPPED TO DEATH Toddler killed after putting phone charger in mouth while plugged into wall 'RAPE' RAP Oritse Williams' manager admits touching 'zombified' girl as 'star raped her' COT CLOTS Celebs' pics of babies sleeping in unsafe conditions 'fuelling cot death rise' WarningMOB JUSTICE Furious crowds strip female ‘shoplifters’ naked, batter them and cut their hair “We’ve obviously taken a keen interest in the development of the new non invasive test – NIPT.  I have no negative feelings about the test itself.

It's an industry obsessed by kit, ” says the organisation's James Keane.For those looking for cheaper options for when disaster might strike, expert ""prepper"" Lincoln Miles - whose services have never before been so in-demand - reveals his tips to stay alive.His business, Preppers Shop UK, started as an online shop in January 2014 but just six months later opened a physical store in Roche, Cornwall, following the success of his products.Mikael Buck - The Sun7 Lincoln tells Sun Online that the prepping business is booming, with demand increasing each month“Every month I’m in business is more successful than the previous,” he explains to Sun Online. “There are always spikes in sales following a big incident – like the Brexit vote or some story about Russia and Trump, for example.”Some of Lincoln’s clients are expert preppers or professional ‘survivalists’, while others seek out his advice due to a feeling of unease about the state of the world.“They have no desire to go into the woods, have never made a campfire or pitched a tent, but just want the reassurance of having a bag ready with everything in it, in case disaster strikes,” says Lincoln.His shop sells plenty of these grab bags (or ""bug out bags"") - with a price tag far more reasonable than Costco’s monster kit, though its contents wouldn't keep you alive for as long.APOCALYPSE HOW? These are the five ways Stephen Hawking predicted the world would endJust under £300 would equip you with enough to survive for a minimum of 72 hours in the wild - including a sharpening stone, survival mirror and a 24 hour ration pack - then after that there are three key aspects to surviving in the wild: food, water and shelter.The kit may look a little knife-heavy, but the gear is intended to be used for cutting down trees and fashioning useful items from wood.Serrated knives are useful for sawing branches and felling small trees, while machetes are designed to cut a path through overgrown vegetation, with a hunting knife used to skin, gut and fillet any animals you fancy eating.7 Prepper kit can include a bug-out bag bulging with survival essentials, knives and hunting kitFood for fuelFood-wise, there are three main types most suited to an emergency situation.Your stocks should be divided up equally between tins (easy to stack and last for 25-30 years), pulses, grains and pastas (which, if dry, can be kept for tens of years), and freeze-dried food.Known as the fuel of astronauts, freeze-dried food can be eaten as soon as you add boiled water, and although it provides all the necessary nutrition in one pack, it doesn’t come cheap. The average freeze-dried meal is around £5.Two freeze-dried meals a day for a year would cost £3,650 – amounting to 1,000 calories a day, which, although not recommended for normal daily life, would suffice in the wild.But rather than splashing your savings on bulk food items, you’d be better off buying minimal foodstuffs and relying on your tools and skills for sourcing food.A pop-up solid fuel cooker (£3.95), no bigger than a wallet, is perfect for cooking your catch or boiling water. Just add a slow-burn hexamine cooking tablet for fuel (£1.95 for 8) and you’re set.AFP or licensors7 Anxieties about the state of the world, largely focused on Trump's war of words with rival nuclear countries, have made more people think seriously about being more preparedRe-hydration stationsAnother priority is water purification tablets (£3) and a water filter (£26), so you can drink straight from a puddle or river and filter it through a straw.Securing shelter is imperative, so your emergency bag should include a heavy-duty tarpaulin (£9) for a makeshift tent, a hammock (£54.44) and an emergency survival bag (£5.98), which doubles up as full-body waterproof lining.In the case of any sort of chemical attack, there is a gas mask and filter (£20), plus a wind-up torch (£13.86).You’ll need a folding saw (£6.32) or tomahawk (£19.95) to cut down branches, several knives, waterproof matches (£1.99), a fire-starter kit (£6) and turbo flame windproof lighter (£9) as basics.But buying all this is a waste if you don’t know how to use it.Mikael Buck - The Sun7 Some say survival hinges on kit, and others reckon it's all about skills... the truth is you probably need a combo of the twoBasic life-saving skillsOld-school primitive survival skills, like starting a fire without a lighter, fishing and hunting are all essential if you want to stand a chance if civilisation goes awry.This should be easy enough if you spent your youth in the Scouts, but not so straightforward if the extent of your day-to-day survival is elbowing your way to the Tesco reduced aisle.“The most important thing is to test all of your kit, make sure it works and practise your routes,” says Lincoln.Woodland Ways offers one-day, weekend and five-day courses (starting from £95) for budding survivalists and Bear Grylls wannabes to learn about the thermal properties of water and air, foraging and creating fire by friction.Getty - Contributor7 Preppers are convinced that the end of the world is always just around the corner""We encourage people to come to our 5-day course with all their stuff and over the week, they find themselves eschewing much of it and throwing away what they don’t use or need. But fire, steel and a first aid kit remain vital, even if you’re a top expert in this,” says James.In the event of a breakdown of infrastructure, escaping your home is another matter that requires some consideration.Good old-fashioned map-reading wouldn't go amiss, as there's no doubt that Google Maps would be the first to go if everyone began frantically searching an escape route at the same time.Most read in NewsDYING WISH Single mum loses fight with cancer after asking family 'Look after my boys' ExclusiveROO'S FURY Wayne Rooney livid after bro filmed looking pally in pub loo with Tommy Robinson ZAPPED TO DEATH Toddler killed after putting phone charger in mouth while plugged into wall 'RAPE' RAP Oritse Williams' manager admits touching 'zombified' girl as 'star raped her' COT CLOTS Celebs' pics of babies sleeping in unsafe conditions 'fuelling cot death rise' WarningMOB JUSTICE Furious crowds strip female ‘shoplifters’ naked, batter them and cut their hair A traffic build-up to leave a city would point towards taking rural routes – think canals and towpaths – as the system runs nationwide.James recommends leaving on foot or via waterways, which is why a grab-bag that you can sling over your shoulder is vital.So over-packers, take note - travelling light and thinking practically is your best bet if Armageddon arrives.Teen has spent years preparing for the end of the world and learning survival skills"

Instead, let us inject a big dose of energy and enthusiasm into the Conservative cause, fire up our campaigning machine and take the battle of ideas to Labour.""New Tory vice chair says Chris Grayling error a 'mistweet' by an 'overexcited' person in CCHQCaroline Nokes - Immigration MinisterAFP or licensors19 Immigration minister Caroline Nokes arriving in Downing StreetTimes Newspapers Ltd19 Nokes pictured in 2002 when she was standing for Romsey in HampshireThe Romsey North MP has been bumped up into the Cabinet into the tricky position of Immigration Minister.She was in Government already in her role at the Department for Work and Pensions, but will now attend Cabinet with Theresa May.Previously nicknamed a Cameron 'cutie', the Tory Mp once had an affairs with a party activist 10 years her junior, her husband revealed - even meeting him in a London hotel room after a Commons vote.""I've been told I'm too pretty to be in politics,"" she told Glamour magazine back in 2005 - but she says she was inspired to stand for Parliament by the 1997 intake that were dubbed 'Blair's babes'. Nadhim Zahawi - Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Education19 Mr Zahawi's family fled to Britain when he was just sevenThe Stratford-Upon-Avon MP was one of the original founders of the polling company YouGov - along with Stephan Shakespeare. He was CEO of the firm until he won his seat in 2010.He's also a keen horse-rider and ran a riding school along with wife Lana - and once won 'craziest parking ticket of the year' in 2004 for getting slapped with one when he was in an ambulance after a moped accident.But in 2011 he was left red faced when his musical tie went off in a Commons debate. The Deputy Speaker advised him to choose his officewear more carefully in future.Last year he spoke up against Donald Trump's travel ban which prevented a number of Brits born in other countries from visiting the US.He told the Sun today that he was ""over the moon"" with his appointment. Damian Hinds - Education SecretaryAFP or licensors19 Damian Hinds was appointed Education Secretary last night, replacing Justine GreeningThe Catholic grammar school graduate will be more in tune with Theresa May's beliefs than his predecessor, the comprehensive-educated Justine Greening.After being elected to his East Hampshire constituency in 2010, was made Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury in 2015 before becoming Employment minister in 2016 under Mrs May.Before he entered Parliament he spent his life working in pubs, breweries and the hotel industries.He's also a former chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Social Mobility - which will please the PM who wants to continue to show a focus on the issue. Suella Fernandes - Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Exiting the European UnionFacebook19 Suella Fernandes, a Treasury aide went against Philip Hammond's plans to support a hard Brexit letter urging ministers not to stay in the Single Market during a transition periodThe ardent Brexiteer, first elected to Fareham in 2015, will be a good fit for her new role in the Brexit Department - but could also ruffle some feathers.Last year the MP, whose parents emigrated to Britain from Kenya and Mauritius, caused a rift in her own department when the then Treasury aide went against her boss Philip Hammond and urged ministers not to stay in the Single Market during a transitional period.The ex-barrister, who is also the former chair of the European Reform Group, headed up a letter, signed by dozens of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, which said that we should not stay in the EU ""by stealth"" and it would be a ""historic mistake"" to continue with the status quo.She's also a Commissioner on the Social Market Foundation commission on inequality in education, an interest which will please Mrs May - and is a graduate of the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme. Brandon Lewis - new Tory party chairman (previously an Immigration Minister in the Home Office)PA:Press Association19 Brandon Lewis has been appointed the new chairman of the Conservative PartyBrandon Lewis takes on a new role from Patrick McLoughlin, as the chairman of the party - and also gets the brief of Minister without Portfolio.After the botched election result, Mrs May needs a new face to help her turn the party's luck around.A former colleague at the Home Office, 46-year-old Lewis has been the MP for Great Yarmouth since 2010.And he impressed quickly, being promoted to a junior minister in the Department for Communities and Local Government in 2012 before being appointed Minister of State for Housing in 2014.In 2016 he was moved to the Home Office and promoted to the Privy Council.He's also a good media performer and is regularly sent out to the airwaves to bat for the Tories and defend major announcements.Mr Lewis is a close ally of former Cabinet heavyweight Eric Pickles - the pair once hosted a show on an Essex radio station called The Eric and Brandon Show. Esther McVey - Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (formerly an Employment Minister in the Coalition Government)Reuters19 Esther McVey is making a comeback to the cabinet - two and a half years after she lost her Commons seatEsther McVey is new to Theresa May's Cabinet this year, but has worked with her in the past as employment minister in the Department for Work and Pensions.The MP for Tatton won George Osborne's old seat in 2017 - two years after she was booted out in a shocking defeat in 2015. She also eyed up standing in David Cameron's old seat in Witney when he resigned.The former GMTV presenter once posed for a series of saucy snaps in her underwear, a low-cut top, and a towel.The law graduate modelled for a magazine shoot in 1999 - and declared she was celibate curing her stint as the early morning starts were not conductive to ""rumpy pumpy"".The Tory poster girl topped a list of the female politicians married men would most like to bed back in 2015 - which also saw blonde bombshell Boris Johnson top the choice for female voters.But she attracted a lot of criticism for suggesting that the rise of people going to food banks was a part of the Tory austerity project.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell once made comments about her being lynched during a comedy night attended by leftie activists and Labour politicians.ALAN OLLEY/SCOPE FEATURES.COM19 As a TV presenter, Esther McVey took part in a rather racy photoshootPA:Press Association19 The former employment minister lost her seat in the 2015 election - but won another one back in 2017 Claire Perry - Minister of State for Climate Change and IndustryGetty Images - Getty19 Claire Perry seemed happy with her promotion to Immigration Minister last nightThis won't be the first time Ms Perry has been in Government, but it is the first time she'll be able to attend Cabinet meetings after being given her new job as a Business Minister.But it's not always been such sunlit uplands - the once Rail Minister threw in the towel last year as she was ""fed up of justifying how c*** our railways are"", she told friends.She bravely took on The Sun's Choo Choo Challenge back in 2014 and jumped on a crammed train from Reading to London - meeting disgruntled commuters who had to sit on the floor to travel.The MP was also ordered back in 2012 to pay compensation for unfairly sacking one of her members of staff - and had to cough up £1,296.88.And her Leaver colleagues won't be impressed when they remember that she once said she felt Brexiteers were ""like jihadis in their support for a hard Brexit"".Good luck Claire... Matt Hancock - Culture Secretary19 Matt Hancock rocking out at last year's Tory conferenceThe former Digital Minister will be happy he stayed put under Theresa May and put his head down to work - rather than leaving Government like many other of George Osborne's allies.The newly promoted grime fan will be fondly remembered by MPs and journalists alike for singing not only Queen classic Don't Stop Me Now at last year's Tory party conference, but also for belting out Happy Birthday... to himself.The 39-year-old will be the youngest Cabinet minister in May's reshuffled team - and last night he proved he could still handle a late night as he partied with Rita Ora at a London Fashion Week dinner.He revealed recently that his favourite song is Ed Sheerman's Galway Girl (what, Matt?).19 Matt Hancock was happy to be given the role of Culture Secretary yesterday Kemi Badenoch - Vice Chair for Candidates (CCHQ)Rex Features19 Kemi Badenoch was once mistaken for a Labour MPThe Prime Minister's warm up act for last year's Tory conference speech quickly made a name for herself since becoming an MP last June.Hailed as a bright rising star, the 37-year-old MP for Saffron Waldon in Essex was thrust into the spotlight with an intensely personal speech, full of optimism and belief in Britain.She migrated from Nigeria aged just 16 - with just a passport and £100 in her pocket - and now she will be helping CCHQ get in good candidates in time for the next election.Studying for A-Levels part-time while working in McDonalds before studying computer systems engineering, Badenoch is an ideal advocate for Mrs May's aims to try and push a 'British dream'.After a short stint in IT, she became interested in politics and was elected to the London Assembly in 2016.In her maiden speech she said she was often ""mistaken for a member of the Labour party"" - but is Conservative to her roots after living under socialist policies.She said: ""Growing up in Nigeria I saw real poverty… Going without electricity, doing my homework by candlelight because the state electricity board could not provide power. Fetching water a mile away in heavy, rusty buckets because the nationalised water could not get water to flow from the taps.""In Theresa Mays new cabinet...The numbers:31% leave campaigners11 who went to private schools48% went to OxbridgeAverage age: 5034% are women Ben Bradley - Vice Chair for Youth (CCHQ)19 Ben Bradley says the Tories need to change their image so they stop being seen as just a party of old, grey menHe once won beard of the year, but now this stubbly young Tory will be the vice-chair for youth in CCHQ.The MP for Mansfield plays goal in a men's hockey team - and has a strong Instagram game you should definitely check out.He's only in his late twenties, and also entered the Commons along with Badenoch in 2017Bradley wants to tackle the ""huge challenge"" of turning around the stereotypical Tory image of only attracting old, grey blokes.""If the trends continue from 2017 in terms of young people, people from ethnic minorities who just don't vote for us,"" says Mr Bradley, ""then we're going to be in a mess.""He says the party needs more people like Georgia Toffolo - who admitted on this year's I'm a Celebrity Show that she was a proud Tory - to put the party's message across. Lucy Frazer -  Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Justice19 Lucy Frazer is MP for South East CambridgshireJewish MP Lucy Frazer has become a Justice Minister today - after only being elected to her South East Cambridgeshire seat in 2015. Rishi Sunak - Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local GovernmentSolent News19 Tory backbencher Rishi Sunak has said that Britain will find itself with 'opportunities to innovate after leaving the EU'Another Brexiteer for Mrs May's Government comes in the form of 2015-intake MP Rishi Sunak.The MP represents Richmond, Yorks, in ex-Tory leader William Hague's old seat.His political progress has been closely followed in India, because his wife Akshata is the daughter of billionaire tech tycoon Narayana Murthy, founder of one of the country's largest firms.Earlier this year he hit out at the EU's ""dismal record"" of opening up new trade markets for member states, arguing that outside the Customs Union, Britain can get back control of its trade policy.He's also a strong advocate of cheese, and has pushed for more help to be directed to dairy farmers struggling in his constituency in Yorkshire.He has also admitted to a formidable sweet tooth - eating a chocolate muffin for breakfast every morning and slurping down gallons of Coke. Oliver Dowden - Cabinet Office ministerBarcroft Media19 Oliver Dowden has also been promotedDavid Cameron's deputy chief of staff has been promoted into the Cabinet Office team.He previously worked for the Conservative Research Department and PR firm Hill & Knowlton.The MP for Hertsmere was given a CBE in the 2015 honours list -

104,Accrington Stanley owner Andy Holt reveals the ten major changes he wants to see in football,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/4985556/andy-holt-accrington-stanley-owner-reveals-changes/,"23rd November 2017, 10:30 pm","AS owner and chairman of Accrington Stanley my eyes have been opened.I call myself an accidental chairman-owner because there was no intention of ever being involved in football, I took the job because there was a real need for someone to stabilise the club.11 Accrington Stanley owner Andy Holt has revealed ten changes he wants to see in the beautiful gameA football club is a crucial community asset. I watch social interactions take place at what is the only major gathering point around the town of Accrington.I will never own Accrington Stanley, it belongs to the community and the town. I can’t pick it up and take it home, it will never be mine.It is massively important and the job description is during my occupation is to give the club a long term stable future by building on its history, that goes back to 1888. Then to pass the baton onto the next person in the long line of owner-chairmen.The club will be in a better shape when I leave than when I started and if all in football followed this basic principle things wouldn’t be in the mess it is now.SUN BETS: BET £10 GET A FREE £30 BETCRAIG_BROUGH11 The financial gap between rich and poor clubs is growingThere are really big issues that I had no knowledge of and was ignorant about before I took over, so here are some changes I’d like to see within the game.I accept I’m new to the game, but I think that’s a positive because I have not yet been forced to conform to the script doled out by the so-called authorities.SKY BLUE SEND OFF Accrington Stanley's Jordan Moseley to be buried in Man City scarf1. Stretched-out finances - and it is getting worseTHE gap between the rich and poorest clubs grows ever wider. And the funding strategy employed by both the Premier League and the EFL exaggerate an already bad position.EFL funding states that for income over £67million the split is 90 per cent to the Championship, with six per cent and four per cent for Leagues One and Two respectively.I strongly object to this and would do even if our club was in the Championship. This will inevitably lead to PL2 as Leagues One and Two are decoupled from the gravy train.Craig_Brough11 Parachute payments need to be abolished immediately2. Ban parachute paymentsPARACHUTE payments distort competition.Those in the Championship that have not had the drop money, are completely disadvantaged by it.If the Prem wants to put around £250m each year into the Championship, give each club £10m rather than distort the second tier.Craig_Brough11 Clubs should be free to do business whenever they want in a season3. End the transfer windowTHE EFL board want to close our transfer window before the season starts, barring loans, to match the Prem without watching how it all pans out for them.Restricting transfers at our level is barmy and I have made this clear to the EFL. Why would clubs vote to restrict their opportunity to trade?Sales of players is a critical revenue stream for lower league clubs and rightly so.We take players in, work with them and if they are successful they move higher for which we are compensated.If a club in League One or League Two needs to sell a player and there is a suitor, they should be allowed to sell anytime. There doesn’t need to be a regulatory strait-jacket.Craig_Brough11 Clubs should be allowed to make use of emergency loans4. Bring back loansEFL clubs are no longer allowed to make emergency loans outside the transfer window after a recent rule change.This was disastrous to both clubs and players.The impact on Accrington was that we had to increase our squad to cover injuries and suspensions. This cover added £200,000 to our player budget cost.Lots of lads sit miserable on the bench and cannot get a game as they are blocked from moving to a club that would get them on the pitch elsewhere.CRAIG_BROUGH11 The amount of money received by agents should be capped5. Cap agent feesMANY agents are good. Sadly, some are not.There should be a cap on what an agent can get from players and clubs.There also has to be transparency.It should not be the press that finds out what an agent is paid as happened on the Paul Pogba transfer.All clubs should state on record what it pays or earns in relation to a transfer - and a penalty put in place for misrepresentation of facts.And I mean ALL costs, including expenses for intermediaries. Transparency stops corruption because both buying and selling clubs accounts have to match.Craig_Brough11 There needs to be more engagement between fans and those in charge6. Top dogs should engage more with fansI USE Twitter and I think it is the perfect communication strategy for chairmen.It allows fans into your inner thoughts and rationale, and gives them a chance to question your strategy.I have gained much knowledge from fans comments on social media.I know better what my job is and have saved money for the club by not doing some costly change that the fans neitherwant nor value.I spend matchdays at home with fans, not directors. They keep me grounded and tell me the score.Remember the club belongs to the town and it’s townsfolk. Chairmen are temporary.CRAIG_BROUGH11 Safe standing areas should be brought back to stadiums7. Revisit safe-standing regulationsAFTER the Hillsborough disaster, football authorities naturally acted aggressively to get change and stop any repeat.But many football fans like to stand and it is definitely possible to accommodate this whilst still having a safe stadium.We need to stop treating fans like we are still in the hooligan age. We have to move away slowly from overzealous regulations that can spoil the matchday experience.Craig_Brough11 Refs should receive more praise and more money for their hard work8. Refereeing standards.REFEREES have the most challenging, thankless task on the pitch and come in for much abuse, no matter what they do.But the standards are way too low. This is not just my opinion, it is shared by many.Referees need more pay and more training.They can and do make more impact on the outcome of a game than any player. Why are they paid less than players on the pitch?Refereeing needs to be a valuable and highly-paid vocation. The standards should be raised year in, year out.Craig_Brough11 Premier League clubs shouldn't be allowed to just snap up youngsters at will9. Prevent Prem hoarding of young talentYOUNG lads do not benefit from being locked in an U23 academy for years. They do not get real life playing experience that lower leagues deliver.The kids should start low and work up to the Prem. They should not be hoarded by big clubs that have no intention ofplaying them in their first teams.The current system of lower league clubs PAYING the Prem clubs to give their lads experience is abhorrent.THEY should be paying us or at the very least letting them out for free. They are killing a valuable revenue stream for us and charging us for the pleasure.The image of the Prem is one of greed and waste and they don’t do anything to help their image here. Quite why they need to take a few hundred quid a week off lower league clubs is beyond me.Craig_Brough11 More owners and chairmen need to start standing up for what's right in football10. Thou shalt not speak - no more, I say!VERY few owners and chairmen are prepared to publicly say what they really think about the football set-up.This is a real problem for the future of the game. Football authorities actually threaten funding if owners speak out.The rich clubs in the Prem run the game. They decide the agenda on academies, transfer windows, funding, TV money and the rest.The EFL has no option but to go along with them because they are the paymasters.Fans know this and continually tell me this. They are not stupid - they feel the EFL and its clubs bow to every whim of the top flight.Their feelings are not without merit.And if we do not want another situation where fans are boycotting their own clubs as in the Checkatrade Trophy, we had better start listening to them and giving them a voice.Full Saturday Premier League preview including Manchester United v Brighton and Liverpool v Chelsea"

There is nothing which cannot be found. As a dowser and world authority on Astral Projected Triangulation I locate at a corporate level, water, mineral deposits and oil for prospective companies.''I sell psychic readings for items such as gold in the ground, missing pets, or long lost relatives. All I need is a photo of said item sent to me together with a map of your area.''But the court heard Stott's persistent behaviour towards the mother and daughter caused them ''alarm and distress.''Cavendish Press4 He has been banned from contacting 65-year-old Miss Knight and Tyla for ten years under the terms of a restraining orderProsecutor Carl Gaffney said: ""The charges officially relate to events from 2008 up until June 2017 - but some went back further than that to 1985. Mr Stott had a brief liaison with Carrie Knight back in 1985 and he had fallen for her, so to speak.""He would send her letters about continuing their liaison to which she always declined. These feelings he had for her grew stronger as time went on.""He continued to send letters to her and her daughter. She resisted these letters politely but firmly. He explained that he had come to believe that he was the father of her daughter. This caused a great deal of distress not just to Miss Knight herself, but to the whole family.""He was incredibly persistent and this made her daughter aware of the history between them. Miss Knight sent him many messages saying he was not to contact her anymore and she told him he definitely wasn't the father.""The most disturbing aspect of all was that he wrote a book or short novella that came from his imagination, where the male protagonist portrayed a version of himself that he believed to be real, but wasn't.The most disturbing aspect of all was that he wrote a book or short novella that came from his imagination, where the male protagonist portrayed a version of himself that he believed to be real, but wasn’t""The contents of the book were written in such a way that anyone would know that he believed them to be true. There was talk of the protagonist who was attracted to a young woman who was of school age, there were spankings, beatings and sexual imagery.""The way he phrased it made it seem like a reality - when in fact it was his imagination. He sent this book via computer disk to Miss Knight's daughter for her to read and this was the final straw and the police were called.""He doesn't understand what he did was wrong. Whilst this may have been a mild form of harassment as he didn't physically approach them, this feels much darker and caused much distress to those involved. This was clearly a reality that he built for himself.""In mitigation Khadim Al'hassan, Stott's barrister, said: ""My client has no issue with non contact with the the complainant. Since his arrest he has not attempted to approach Ms Knight or her daughter.""Throughout that whole period of time he didn't think what he was doing was wrong. But he wants to close the chapter on that part of his life. I think he does need help with his thinking skills and his alcohol dependency. He only sent letters at Christmas and birthdays and such.Alamy4 Stott was sentenced at Manchester Magistrate's Court to a 12-month community order and was ordered to complete 80 hours' unpaid work''We need to get down to the bottom of what was the cause behind all this, as he does not know himself. He had lost his wife during that time and it massively affected the relationships with his family. He is now in a stable relationship with his partner who is sat in court, fully supportive of him today. She tells me 'he is a nice, caring man'.""He has also had issues with his tenant who has refused to pay his rent for the last 6-7 months, so that's has been an added bonus to the stress caused by these proceedings. Whilst this may be a disturbing set of events, such events that have lasted an incredibly long time, we need to get down to the bottom of why he sent those letters and and give him the help he needs.""Stott was sentenced to a 12-month community order and was ordered to complete 80 hours' unpaid work. He will also attend a three month alcohol treatment programme. He was also ordered to pay £385 court costs.District Judge Nicholas Sanders told Stott: ""I find this very disturbing especially the fact that you don't realise that what you did was entirely wrong. I'm hoping this order will give you the necessary time to reflect on your actions and examine where you will go from here.''As Stott was leaving the dock he said to the judge: ""Thank you sir for this lenient sentence, it's greatly appreciated.""But in statement Tyla said after the case: ''I didn't receive any support whatsoever from police and I felt like I wasn't being heard.

Apparently he is. But then so, ­probably, are you. I mean, who isn’t?A journalist has suggested we should remove Nelson from on top of his column in Trafalgar Square — the place named after his last, final victory over the awful French, of course.Photographers Choice - Getty15 You cannot judge historical figures by the standard of modern timeAfua Hirsch condemned our naval hero for having been a steadfast supporter of slavery. Afua is of Ghanaian descent.Ghana has its own long ­history with slavery. They were enslaving folk long before we came along and continued long after we’d banned it. But still.Is she right? Almost certainly. The majority of British people in the 18th Century were pro slavery.A few dozen years later the tide had changed and we ­abolished the practice.In the parts of Africa we hadn’t ­colonised, slavery ­continued unabated. Much as it did throughout the horrible Islamic Ottoman Empire.When these perpetually gobby campaigners start screaming at you about slavery, they don’t even tell you a tenth of the story. Either because they are ­ignorant of the facts or find them ­inconvenient.But more to the point, if we started tearing down the ­statues of famous Brits on account of their worst beliefs, we’d have no heroes left. No country would.Rex Features15 Afua Hirsch is a journalist who called for the statue of Nelson to be taken down from Trafalgar SquareYou can’t judge ­historical figures by the standards of our time.Winston Churchill, for example, was brought up to believe that the white man, especially the English white man, was ­superior.He regarded all of Africa and Asia as populated by ­savages.From today’s perspective, we know that he was largely wrong about that. He also said: “I hate Indians.They are a beastly people with a beastly religion.”But that is not why we remember him. Every man is better than his worst deed or opinion.We remember Churchill for saving ­Britain — and the world — from fascism. For being a brilliant leader.PA:Press Association15 Winston Churchill regarded the Indians as 'beastly' yet we still revere him for his leadership in World War IIJust as we remember Nelson for his military genius and, importantly, ability to whup the French.Our greatest leaders — but also our greatest artists, ­writers, scientists — will all have held opinions which today would seem shocking.That’s the thing about the past — they did things ­differently there.Look for nuggets of racism and sexism in the works of William Shakespeare and you’ll find ’em, sure enough. Because he was writing more than 400 years ago.AP:Associated Press15 Protests erupting in the US demanding Confederate statues should be torn down are just as repellent as demanding the statue of Nelson to be taken downDoes it mean he wasn’t a great writer? No, of course not.The white liberals and black activists are getting increasingly shrill. Demanding we expunge everything from our nation’s history which doesn’t accord with their own, absolutist mindsets.They are doing the same thing in the US, insisting that Confederate flags and statues be torn down.But the American civil war wasn’t ­simply about slavery. And — as ­Donald Trump said — many of the northern ­abolitionists had views which were just as repellent, from today’s perspective, as those which came from southern leaders.Reuters15 The statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee was covered in CharlottesvilleAFP or licensors15 Donald Trump said that many northern abolitionists held racist and repellent viewsSo do you wipe out EVERYTHING?You can’t rewrite and whitewash history.

119,I was treading on eggshells as I described the very specific problem of ‘some’ Muslim men and their attitude to white Western women,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4259021/i-was-treading-on-eggshells-as-i-described-the-very-specific-problem-of-some-muslim-men-and-their-attitude-to-white-western-women/,"16th August 2017, 8:58 pm","SOME Sun readers may have missed the concocted explosion of Labour and Islamic hysteria over a column I wrote on Monday about Muslim sex gangs.This fake fury was largely confined to a small circulation, mostly-online newspaper and a letter from a bunch of lefties dragooned by the Muslim Council of Britain.Stewart Williams - The Sun4 Sun columnist Trevor KavanaghMy offence was to write about the attitude of predatory Muslim men towards white women - what I called “the Muslim Problem”.I was instantly denounced for fomenting a Nazi-style “Final Solution” comparable only with the Jewish Holocaust. It was a ludicrous, offensive and perverse distortion of the truth.A letter calling for my dismissal signed by 105 cross-party MPs was led by Labour’s Naz Shah, the Bradford MP suspended last year for anti-Semitism.In a series of social media posts in 2014 she shared a graphic with the headline ""Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States” adding the message “problem solved” - and urged friends to back a poll criticising Israel saying “the Jews are rallying”.Jeremy Corbyn accepted her reinstatement after a few weeks, sparking criticism over his own alleged anti-Semitism along with that of his pal Red Ken Livingstone.Fake claims of Islamophobia are the price journalists risk today if we dare question the conduct of a minority hostile to the host community.PA:Press Association4 A letter calling for my dismissal signed by 105 cross-party MPs was led by Labour’s Naz Shah, the Bradford MP suspended last year for anti-SemitismAt the outset I want to state the vast majority of Muslims in Britain are decent, generous, hospitable and law-abiding men and women who add to the fabric of this nation.They have nothing whatsoever to do with the customs and primitive practices referred to in my article. Indeed they are as appalled as the rest of us by extremism.But it is impossible to write about Muslims without catching the eagle eye of MCB assistant general secretary Miqdaad Versi.I have been on the receiving end of his vigilance – he has had two IPSO adjudications against The Sun and recognises that as a Sun journalist and as a board member of the Independent Press Standards Organisation, where he is a regular complainant, I represent a particularly juicy target.So, as ever when writing about Islam this week, I was treading on eggshells as I described the very specific problem of “some” Muslim men and their attitude to white Western women.The article followed the trial and imprisonment of 17 mainly British-born men from the Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Indian, Iraqi, Iranian and Turkish communities who groomed, raped and abused scores of vulnerable young, mainly white, girls over many years.PA:Press Association4 On Monday, I paid tribute to Sarah Champion’s courageThey were among many gangs operating in Britain but police and local authorities turned a deliberate blind eye. It was left to the courage and tenacity of Times reporter Andrew Norfolk to bring them to book.I cited Rotherham Labour MP Sarah Champion who bravely broke ranks and identified the problem everyone else on the Left had shied away from.She told Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ve got now hundreds of men, Pakistani men, who have been convicted of this crime.“Why are we not commissioning research to see what’s going on and how we need to change what’s going on so it never happens again?”She added: “The far right will attack me for not doing enough, the floppy left will have a go at me for being a racist.“But this isn’t racist, this is child protection and we need to be grown up about this and deal with it.”The Sun asked Ms Champion if she would write an op-ed piece for the following day's paper, expanding on her comments.She happily agreed and filed an article that was approved by her office.Sarah was delighted. Her only request was for us to use a more flattering picture in future.In a message to our features editor the morning after, an aide said: “She is absolutely thrilled with it. However, she is mortified that you've used such an ancient picture of her - it is about five years old!”Presumably got at by Corbynistas, she has subsequently sought to distance herself from her own article and has now resigned for her “poor choice of words”.On Monday, I paid tribute to Sarah’s courage, saying: “Thanks to ex-Equalities chief Trevor Phillips and Labour MPs like Rotherham’s Sarah Champion, it is acceptable to say Muslims are a specific rather than cultural problem.""Northumbria Police4 Evil members of a child sex grooming network who abused girls as young as 14 in NewcastleI went on to say how one of the gang “starkly identified the gulf between some Muslim men and the white British women they regard as prey: “They are good for one thing, for me to f*** and use like trash.”That goes for the Albanian and Bulgarian child sex traffickers setting up shop across Britain.The abuse of women by Muslims, says Trevor Phillips, is “on an industrial scale"".“What the perpetrators have in common is their proclaimed faith. They are Muslims, and many of them would claim to be practising. It is not Islamophobic to point this out.”My mistake, apparently, was to describe this as “the Muslim Problem”.I can honestly say it never occurred to me that this could be interpreted as a play on “the Jewish Problem” and I will happily apologise to anyone who is thus offended.Perhaps this is because I have never believed there was a Jewish Problem. There certainly was a Nazi problem with the Jews. And there was the nightmare of “the Final Solution”.But the Jews have never been a problem as far as I am aware.Having visited many countries in the Middle East, I can vouch for the fact that Israel alone stands out as the only beacon of true democracy and I am a huge admirer of the Jewish state and its citizens.This fake outrage is more than simply a personal attack on me or upon the Sun newspaper. It is a pernicious attempt to stifle and smother free speech.The letter from the MPs fails to pinpoint a single mistake or error of fact in my article. The letter is nothing less than an attempt to gag not just me but anyone else who dares to venture an opinion which contradicts their narrow point of view.For the record, I vehemently deny being Islamophobic, even though - like a very large number of Muslims - I disapprove of Islam’s most medieval practices.Indeed, only two weeks ago, I wrote: “We often ask Muslims to stand up and speak out. So when they do so, we should applaud.""This weekend, 30,000 Muslims raised the Union Jack over a festival in Hampshire to demonstrate loyalty to the UK.Imam Ahmad Farhad says: ""The Prophet Mohammed taught loyalty to your country is part of your faith. We instil loyalty to your nation from a very young age.""Meanwhile, Turkish-born Seyran Ates is setting up mosques in Britain and Europe which are open to men, women, gays and believers of all faiths. People have been executed for less.These are small, brave steps. It’s difficult to imagine Islamist fanatics following suit. But it’s a start.Nor can The Sun be accused of Islamophobia. Thousands of our hardworking newsagents are Muslim and have our respect.Times journalist Clare Foges wrote this today without arousing adverse comment: ""Britain is a pretty liberal country. We respect people’s freedom to live as they please, within the law.“But when separateness grows to mean a scant regard for the laws and courtesies that frame life for most of us, we have a serious problem.""She was talking about Travellers. Otherwise, her words and mine could be interchangeable.* A previous version of this article said that the letter from the MPs conceded there were no grounds for referring the original column to Ipso for adjudication. The letter did not state that, and so the sentence has now been removed. We have also amended the article to make clear that the letter was not signed exclusively by Labour MPs, but also by some politicians from other parties."

In the US, nurseries have existed in old people’s homes for more than 25 years.And the effect on the group of 11 pensioners at St Monica’s was almost immediate.Tests carried out on the OAPs had shown one third of the group was depressed. Nine felt their life was “unexciting” and more than half said they felt “hopeless” about the future.A team led by ageing expert ­Professor Malcolm Johnson of Bath University set the pensioners and children a series of experiments aimed at improving their lives.Not known refer to copyright holder16 Resident Hamish shares afternoon tea with Eva and MillieNot known refer to copyright holder16 86-year-old Monica formed a close bond with four-year-old SolomonNot known refer to copyright holder16 (left to right) Michael, Noah, Pat and MillieThe results are extraordinary and moving. The experiments revealed that simply playing games with the kids, walking around the retirement home grounds and taking part in a sports day had a transformative effect.Lifelong bachelor Hamish, 88, a retired insurance manager, has an artificial leg after being knocked down by a lorry aged 14.During his four years at St Monica’s, he spent more than eight hours a day sitting in his chair.When the children first introduce themselves to the old folk in the ­programme, he pointedly stays seated.But when the experts bring in some duck eggs ready to hatch in ­incubators, the infectious excitement of the children makes Hamish unexpectedly animated.Four-year-old Millie forms a bond with Hamish, describing him as her “favourite person”.Not known refer to copyright holder16 Sheila and Eva draw together as residents were encouraged to interact with kidsNot known refer to copyright holder16 Residents Monica, Linda and Mary spend time with youngsters Solomon, Nelson and AmiyaWithin a fortnight, Hamish is rolling around on the floor pretending to be a lion while his young charges scream with delight. Slowly, he starts to forget he needs a stick at all.But one pensioner initially struggles to interact with the children.Zina, a retired council worker from Holland, was once fit and active and used to go hiking in the mountains with husband Bernard. The couple moved to St Monica’s when he was diagnosed with early dementia.Tests revealed she was the most depressed OAP in the group and “grieving” over her husband’s illness.But in moving scenes, the 77-year-old gives a small cry of delight when a little girl called Eva rushes over to ask for her help after the duck eggs start to hatch.Zina says: “To find a child’s hand in yours is one of the most moving things that can happen to you.To find a child’s hand in yours is one of the most moving things that can happen to you– Zina, 77MOST READ IN LIVINGTAKE A GOOD GANDER Only one in eight people can spot the fox hiding among the geese in this tricky optical illusion Sex Secrets Prostitute who earns £2,000 a week reveals the average penis size ... and how much she enjoys work NOT JUST SPOTS!

But I don’t know who that would be.”Yet within days she is smiling and playing with the youngsters who are keen to get her involved in the games.Over time the children also showed development in their behaviour, becoming more mature and thinking more about other people’s feelings.Not known refer to copyright holder16 Zina and Mary sit with SolomonNot known refer to copyright holder16 Monica and Hamish relax on the sofa while Dot and Ellie O play at their feetCutie Solomon was just three years old during filming and not ready for school.But after bonding immediately with 86-year-old Monica, he became more confident, talking for longer and ­mixing with different people.Monica, a widowed former secretary, said: “Some of them have really come out of their shells.“Solomon told his mum that ‘Monica was funny’ but apparently that’s a compliment.“Children either like you or they don’t. And if they don’t, you’ve had it! At one point I was sitting in one of the armchairs and he ran across the room and flung himself on me.

At the beginning, the grown-ups had to choose a child to do some art work with and I was frightened to death.“I sort of stood there looking like a village idiot and Amiya came up, took my hand and said, ‘You’re ­coming with me’.“I was very grateful to her for ­coming to my rescue because I was just frozen, really.

Most people probably don’t see their grandchildren enough.“So I thought this was a good idea and I was curious to see what would happen. It has been great fun.Little Amiya’s mum Chelsie Neville, 27, said she was sceptical about her four-year-old daughter taking part.She said: “I wasn’t sure if she’d enjoy it or if she’d get too tired, but she has loved every minute of it.“Amiya is a lot more confident and has become a lot more mature in such a small space of time. It’s amazing.“She has picked up some of the elderly lingo. She says things like, ‘Thank you, my darling’, which really makes me laugh. I don’t know what it is exactly, but she and Lynda just have this bond.Not known refer to copyright holder16 Nursery teacher Priyah, with Amiya and Eva“This has opened her eyes up more to the elderly and what their lives entail.“Whenever we’re out, she’ll say ‘hello’ to them all, blow them a kiss, wave at them. She loves them to bits. They’re a bit taken aback at first because ­little kids don’t normally pay much attention to people around them.“I feel like the two ­generations are on a ­similar path, in a way.“They’re the only generations that aren’t working and worrying about money and everything else. So I think that’s why they get on.”Old People’s Home For 4 Year Olds is on Channel 4 on Tuesday, August 1 and the following night, both at 9pm.Help is child's playNot known refer to copyright holder16 Gerontologist Professor Malcolm Johnson created the social experimentTHE leader of the experiment, Professor Malcolm Johnson, believes the show demonstrates how children can dramatically improve the lives of the elderly.The academic, who has spent decades researching and working with older people, said: “Those who are very old lose connections. People die, you become less mobile, you can’t get out to meet people.“When you get into what we call the fourth age, when you lose capability and the ability to sustain yourself, then you might be living at home. People think it is absolutely the best option but it’s not.“Retirement communities are the last lap.“They are the last place you will live before you die. Older people think about it every day.“Their lives have become containers of a multitude of losses. It’s not always fun.“If we can take away some of that depression and put living back in that space then that’s extraordinary.”"
124,Sajid Javid brands housebuilders who keep charging ground rent on homes they flog an ‘extortion racket’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4089403/housebuilders-rent-extortion-racket-sajid-javid/,"24th July 2017, 10:46 pm","COMMUNITIES SECRETARY Sajid Javid will today propose capping rip-off ground rents charged to over a million Brits as he declares war on fat-cat developers.The Tory big hitter will unveil a plan to clamp down on the “feudal” practice of housebuilders fleecing Brits trying to move up the property ladder.Getty Images1 A dream home can become nightmare because of the chargesHe wants to ban developers from selling new build homes as leaseholds.And he is also vowing to tackle spiralling ground rents.This involves proposals to set ground rents to “as low as zero” for new builds also intervening to slash “onerous” charges on the estimated million or so Brits already on leasehold deals.Typically, leasehold agreements are used for flats or properties with a shared space. But Mr Javid said more developers are using leases for new build homes – as a way to “guarantee an income stream”.Speaking last night the Cabinet Secretary said: “It’s clear that far too many new houses are being built and sold as leaseholds, exploiting home buyers with unfair agreements and spiralling ground rents.“Enough is enough.“These practices are unjust, unnecessary and need to stop.”MOST READ IN NEWSDYING WISH Single mum loses fight with cancer after asking family 'Look after my boys' ExclusiveROO'S FURY Wayne Rooney livid after bro filmed looking pally in pub loo with Tommy Robinson ZAPPED TO DEATH Toddler killed after putting phone charger in mouth while plugged into wall 'RAPE' RAP Oritse Williams' manager admits touching 'zombified' girl as 'star raped her' COT CLOTS Celebs' pics of babies sleeping in unsafe conditions 'fuelling cot death rise' WarningMOB JUSTICE Furious crowds strip female ‘shoplifters’ naked, batter them and cut their hair He added: “Our proposed changes will help make sure leasehold works in the best interests of homebuyers now and in the future.”In new consultation published today, the government will say that too often house buyers on a lease are forced to pay huge sums for even tiny alterations to their home.And they are hit by inflation busting increases to ground rent just years after moving in.In one case a family house is now “unsaleable” because the ground rent is set to spiral to £10,000 a year by 2060.In another a homeowner was told that buying the freehold on their property would cost £2,000 – only to find the bill came to £40,000.The Government believes around 10,000 leasehold houses were sold in 2016.Mr Javid said the problem was particularly acute in Greater Manchester and Lancashire but that the practice had begun to spread to other parts of the country.Consultation on the crackdown will last until the middle of September.It’s the latest move by the Department of Communities and Local Government to finally address the housing crisis.The Sun last week revealed that Mr Javid was preparing to unveil a new rule that would force NIMBY councils to take affordability into account when planning new homes.He wants to slap a new legal requirement on councils to greenlight thousands of new homes if the house to price to salary ratio goes above a certain level.The ""test"" has been debated intensely in No.10 for six months amid fears it could spark a rebellion on the Tory backbenchers by effectively capping prices..SCANDAL WILL STOPBy Sajid Javid, Communities SecretaryPop down the shops today – whatever you buy; once you’ve paid it belongs to you. It doesn’t matter if it’s a pack of wine gums or a wedding ring.It should be the same when you buy a home, but too many of the new houses built today are not sold on traditional freehold terms, but as leaseholds.It’s particularly bad in the north of England, where developers are selling new homes on a leasehold basis, and then ripping homeowners off once they’ve moved in.Every week I hear a new horror story: ground rents going up 3,000 per cent, enormous costs for buying out the lease, or paying big bills for permission to make improvements to your own home.This isn’t a clever business model, it’s an extortion racket. Enough is enough. If house builders aren’t prepared to stop themselves, I’ll make them.Today I’ve announced plans to ban the unfair and unjustifiable use of leasehold, and change the law so where a leasehold model does makes sense, it can’t be used to rip people off.In our manifesto we promised to end the leasehold scandal. Today we’re honouring that promise, so home buyers can be confident their dream home won’t turn into a nightmare. "

We have a global reputation for founding great start ups, and we want that to continue.”Pip Wilson17 Pip Wilson wants to see continued access to global talent for her business SOUTH WEST - CONTROL OF OUR SEASVOTED 53% to LEAVEAlamy17 Fishing is important to the Plymouth economyFor fisherman in the South West, Brexit is finally a chance to gain control of Britain’s waters once more - and Michael Gove’s announcement to withdraw from London fisheries convention will have delighted many.Strict EU rules about allowing vessels from a number of other countries to fish in each other’s waters means there are limits on how much of our own fish we can catch.The common fisheries policy sees fish stocks shared out - and the UK can only take between six and eight per cent of the total cod and haddock quota at the moment.Paul Trebilcock, chief executive of The Cornish Fish Producers Organisation, said fisherman in the South West wanted to see Brits get their fare share of access to the waters around the country - and of fishing quotas.He said: ""Currently down here in the south west we have 77% of shellfish landed by EU vessels. We need to address that.""And we really want the 12 mile area of sea around the UK to be for the exclusive use of UK, sustainable ships.""We want to make sure that the UK makes, implements and enforces the rules, not the EU. we recognise there may be some access for EU markets, but it’s our decision, not the EU's.""He welcomed Government movements towards the South West, and urged them to send a message to them that ""the UK is not going to let down fishing again"".And Jim Portas, CEO of ‎South Western Fish Producer Organisation added:  ""Owners of these boats can’t wait to throw off the shackles and have national control of the waters, and resources in them.""Paul Trebilcock17 Paul Trebilcock wants to see control of British waters returned to British farmers NORTH OF ENGLAND - CLOSE TO THE SINGLE MARKETVOTED 58% to LEAVEAlamy17 Sunrise over Roker lighthouse in Sunderland - which voted strongly to quit the EUManufacturing, steel works and other forms of industry have always had a natural home in the north of England - and their loud and clear voices in the referendum were calling out for change.The regions with the highest percentage of leave voters - like the Humber, Tees Valley and Sheffield - also have economies that have suffered the most in recent years.But many of their businesses are keen to remain in the single market - or at least as closely as possible to it.Stephen Gallagher, marketing manager of Chamber Member Canford Audio based in Washington, Sunderland, said: ""We aim to provide our international customers with service levels of an equally high standard, matching those enjoyed by our domestic clients. ""The nature of our customers’ businesses can often lead to urgent product requirements. ""We are actively developing our relationships with European customers and have a team set to travel to Germany next week to further our strategic goal to improve our overseas business.” NORTHERN IRELAND - NO HARD BORDERVOTED 56% to REMAINGetty Images17 Giant's Causeway in County Antrim, Northern IrelandBrexit throws up a difficult dilemma for Ireland - how will it cope with having Northern Ireland out, and the Republic inside the EU?Northern Ireland as a whole voted to stay, but Britain’s result means it’s coming out. However, 400,000 people’s jobs and €60bn of trade relies on the border, according to business figures.EU and UK officials have said it would be a priority to find a solution to hard-border being put up again, but it it highly likely there will be some form of customs control after Brexit.Pete Hannan owns Hannan Meats wholesale business in Moira, County Armagh, and says a hard border with the Republic would be a “catastrophe”.He wanted to see Northern Ireland remain open to business, tourists and investment to help boost its economy. And though he didn’t vote for Brexit and was uncertain about what it would mean, he was confident that after the horsemeat scandal, foot and mouth and BSE, his industry would learn to thrive, survive and adapt after we quit the bloc.He said: “The world isn’t going to end. It’s very important that we close no doors. We don’t want any restrictions on what we produce here or where we send it.“And we absolutely don’t want a hard border with our greatest trading partner.”Pete Hannan17 Pete Hannan says the Northern Ireland border is a huge concernSCOTLAND - GLOBAL TRADING OPPORTUNITIESVOTED 62% to REMAINGetty Images17 Glasgow wanted to Remain in the EU - but are keen to maintain a close relationship with the blocNicola Sturgeon’s been causing trouble for Theresa May after Scotland voted strongly to Remain last year - but it’s clear Britain’s leaving.The Scottish first minister wants to keep close ties to the EU and the single market - but her dreams of another independence vote after Brexit have been hit by losing a number of seats at Westminster in last month’s election.A national study showed that 90 per cent of people wanted to ensure free trade continued after we quit the EU in March 2019.Christopher Gallen, owner of Gray’s Deli in Glasgow, wants a level-playing field for Scotland, and a Brexit that allows top business to export on a global stage.He said: “If Brexit is good for Scotland, it would be good for our business - to provide opportunities and open new avenues.”His priorities include a strong economy, stabilising the pound, and the means to show off Scottish whisky, gin, shortbread and salmon to the world.“Our products are world class - if we can package it up and get it out there,” he said.“If the deals with the EU and other countries are good, we will definitely look to exporting overseas in future.”Christopher Gallen17 Christopher Gallen wants Brexit to open up trading links for Scotland WALES - HELP FOR FARMINGVOTED 52% to LEAVEAlamy17 Farming in Wales could be harmed by BrexitWales opted to quit the EU last year, despite the significant amounts of EU cash that gets funnelled over there.A key concern for farmers in the region is for the UK government to match the subsidies that they received under the EU’s common agricultural policy.Ministers have guaranteed the payments until at least 2022, but there are still concerns over environmental regulations and the effects of Brexit on farming communities.Glyn Roberts, President of the the Farmer’s Union of Wales, said he wanted to see a deal with the EU to secure exports of Welsh produce after we quit the bloc - because trade deals with other countries could take years.He said: “It’s all very well the possibilities of new trade with other countries, but at the end of the day, there are 500million people living in Europe, and they are our customers too.“If we can’t export there, it will be a devastating situation.“There has to be a balance between environment, economy and looking after our farming community.”He also urged talks to feature a transfer of the protected status that UK products have - like Welsh lamb, and Caerphilly cheese.17 Glyn Roberts wants to see protected status on Welsh food secured SOUTH EAST - SMOOTH CUSTOMS AND STRONG BORDERSVOTED 55% to LEAVENews Group Newspapers Ltd17 The port of Dover sees millions use it every yearFor the South East, 13 million passengers and £119billion worth of trade passes through the port of Dover every year, making it hugely important to the local economy.And 27 per cent of Brits were found in a recent YouGov survey to want to ensure Britain and trade freely with the EU without tariff barriers and customs checks.Any extra checks for people travelling, or goods passing in or out, could cause utter chaos.The shipping industry is keen to minimise any disruption and sort out any customs issues as soon as possible in the ongoing Brexit talks.Port of Dover Chief Executive Tim Waggott said: ""Maintaining fluidity at the Dover Straits to protect and promote UK-European land-based trade flows must be one of the key imperatives during the Brexit talks.""That means a tailored solution that maintains the rapid transit of goods through the crossings and the wider freight corridor post-Brexit.""And Guy Platten, CEO of the UK Chamber of Shipping, said he wanted Brexit to see smooth trade move between Britain and the UK, and urged EU negotiators to understand its importance.He said: “The importance of Dover to the UK economy cannot be understated.

YOU SHOULD KNOWHE DUP is pro-Brexit but will not accept any deal re- instating a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.THE party wants corporation tax cut from 19 per cent to 12.5 — well below the Tories’ aim of 17 per cent.ITS manifesto vowed to retain the triple lock on the state pension, which guarantees a yearly rise of at least 2.5 per cent. The Tories promised only a double lock. The DUP also wants to keep universal winter fuel payments for the elderly, which the Conservatives have said will be subject to means testing.ANOTHER DUP manifesto pledge was to scrap air passenger duty.THE TV licence fee should be scrapped — and the BBC radically overhauled.THE DUP opposes same-sex marriage. When its MP David Simpson voted against it in the UK Parliament in 2013 he said it was because the Bible talked about “Adam and Eve” not “Adam and Steve”.THE party is also opposed to abortion.ITS MP Sammy Wilson — the DUP’s former environment minister — is a climate change denier.THE party’s former education spokesman Mervyn Storey once called for creationism to be taught alongside evolution in science classes.A REVIEW of terror laws and a far-reaching defence shake-up are also among the party’s demands. It says these are needed because of “the emerging threats in the 21st Century”.And they highlighted a string of the DUP’s controversial views – from being climate change deniers to opposing abortion and gay marriage.It comes as Nigel Dodds, the DUP deputy leader, and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the party's chief whip, prepare to fly to London from Belfast to secure a deal.In 2013 DUP MP Adam Simpson voted against gay marriage because it said “Adam and Eve” in the bible, not “Adam and Steve”.A handful of MPs also called for the return of the death penalty in 2011.DUP leader Arlene Foster has also spoken out against a ‘hard Brexit’ – and wants to maintain the triple lock and winter fuel payments for pensioners.Soures claimed the DUP also wanted firm assurances that ex-squaddies and vets being investigated also a hated investigation into killings by the British army during the height of the ‘Troubles’ before confirming any ‘confidence and supply’ pact.PA:Press Association12 Theresa May delivering her speech outside No10 on FridayGetty Images12 Theresa May vowed she would stay in No10 - defying calls to step downGetty Images12 Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn managed to pull off a successful election campaignThe Sun in December revealed all 302 killings by soldiers during 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland are being investigated afresh – enraging the DUP and Tory Ministers.Any vets prosecuted could face life sentences while former paramilitaries have escaped sanction under the Good Friday agreement.One source said: “We don’t want to blackmail the Tories – but it’s something we’d like to see movement on. And we believe it would be a popular move throughout England.”Insiders revealed senior DUP figures first spoke with the Tories on Thursday – when it emerged Labour were doing far better than anyone expected.Tory chief whip Gavin Williamson was leading negotiations last night and into the weekend.David McCormick12 The DUP's Sammy Wilson is a climate change denierCrispin Rodwell12 DUP MP David Simpson voted against same-sex marriage in 2013Veteran Northern Ireland commentator Brian Rowan yesterday said the DUP would also be concerned to seek concessions on Brexit and the repercussions on business and trade in the province.And he said: “And I think another thing where they could find common ground is the question of ‘legacy’.“There is a lot of concern about legacy investigations involving soldiers and police officers and I think the DUP and the Conservative Party will probably be having a conversation around that issue.”Tory MP and former Army captain Johnny Mercer told the Sun: “We have to sort out Northern Ireland and end the exploitation of former UK servicemen and women.AP:Associated Press12 It is thought the DUP will demand a king's ransom for Northern Ireland“And sharing with the DUP may present opportunities to do that.”Theresa May wooed the DUP by making reference to the party’s full Conservative and Unionist Party name in her speech in Downing Street yesterday.She talked of joining with her DUP “friends” to “get to work” on Brexit.And she referred to the “strong relationship” between the two parties.“Our two parties have enjoyed a string relationship over many years.“And this gives me the confidence to believe that we will be able to work together in the interests of the whole United Kingdom.”MOST READ IN POLITICS ExclusiveSAJ'S MIGRATION BID Sajid Javid to scrap £30,000 minimum salary threshold for EU migrants ACID THREAT Nigel Farage should have had ACID thrown on him, Labour supporter says 'TOO LATE' Ofcom slammed for waiting until THIRD death before launching reality show probe LatestSHAKEDOWN 'Radicalised Remainer' who threw £5.25 milkshake at Farage charged with assault BORIS BOMBSHELL Boris Johnson is biggest threat to Jeremy Corbyn, Labour voters fear RevealedMILK MANIAC Nigel Farage milkshake attacker is a fanatical Remainer and Corbyn fan DUP leader Arlene Foster hinted at the price of any agreement first thing yesterday morning when she signalled she expected Theresa May could have to stand down completely.At a press conference flanked by her 10 MPs yesterday she said her party would be entering talks with the Tories to explore “how it may it be possible to bring stability to our nation at this time of great challenge”.She said: “Those who want to tear apart the Union that we cherish and benefit from so hugely have been sent a clear and resounding message.“In the days and weeks ahead, it is that Union that will be to the forefront of our minds. The Union is our guiding star.”Labour and Lib Dem figures leapt on the talks to point out how Theresa May was now forming her own ‘coalition of chaos’. And they made reference to the party’s controversial views on abortion and gay rights.For all the analysis - Penny Smith from 8am12Call talkRADIO on 0344 499 1000 Listen on DAB, via the talkRADIO app or online at talkradio.co.ukScottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson suggested she was opposed to any agreement by yesterday tweeting her speech about equal marriage at a Belfast ‘Pride’ event last year.However, last night Davidson confirmed she has demanded a “categoric assurance” from Theresa May that under any deal with the DUP gay rights would be protected in Britain.Ms Davidson said the Tories should be using their influence to advance gay rights in Northern Ireland - the only part of the UK where you can’t have same sex marriage.In a strongly worded statement she said: “There are a number of things that count to me more than party. One of them is country and one of the others  is LGBT rights.”Getty Images12 Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson has demanded 'categoric assurance' from Theresa May that the DUP will not force its gay right views on BritainEarlier this week Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was forced to say the party would not accept an endorsement from a group backed by three main loyalist parliamentary organisations.The Loyalist Communities Council had called for a maximum turnout by unionist voters.Sir Jeffrey countered: “We don’t accept support from anyone who is engaged in paramilitary or criminal activity.”Sinn Fein’s John O’Dowd claimed the Loyalists “use the UDA during the elections and the UDA use the DUP in government”.Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams poured scorn on the anticipated arrangement and said: “History will show alliances between Ulster unionism and British unionism has always ended in tears.“It is far better to look to our own place, to all of the people here, to deal with the people of this island, this part of the island as one community.”Hung PicturePA:Press Association12 DUP leader Arlene Foster with her party's newly-elected MPsFOR a party to get a Commons majority, its MPs must win 326 of the 650 seats — otherwise it’s a hung parliament.In that case, the leader of the party with the most seats can try to form a government. One option is a formal coalition, like in 2010 between the Tories and Lib Dems where they shared ministerial jobs and agenda.The other is a more informal approach known as “confidence and supply”.If the Tories fail to form an alliance, Jeremy Corbyn could try to strike a deal with the SNP, Lib Dems, nationalist parties from Northern Ireland and Greens.Another General Election is possible if a proposed government cannot win enough support for its Queen’s Speech which maps out a legislative schedule.THE RISKS OF A DEALTHERESA May has three main options for governing with the DUP, ranging from a full coalition to an informal arrangement that would see the parties haggle on each law. Most likely is a formal agreement with the DUP backing a Tory Queen’s Speech and Budget, with separate deals on new bills brought to Parliament.This would let the PM get the basic functions of government through Parliament, but she would face Commons battles on all contentious legislation.A coalition would mean at least one DUP Cabinet position.A looser agreement for deals to be struck on a bill-by-bill process would mean Mrs May risking being unable to get any legislation through Parliament as she lacks enough MPs to guarantee it passing.If the Tories failed to get a Queen’s Speech through, Mrs May would have to quit and give Labour the chance to form a government.Jeremy Corbyn would have two weeks to pass a Queen’s Speech or there would be another General Election."

But there is nothing we can do. She has totally f***ed us"".— Robert Peston (@Peston) June 9, 2017The Pound crashed nearly two per cent in a matter of minutes as traders reacted  in disbelief to the exit poll.Sterling had hit a two-week high when the polls opened on hopes of a Tory landslide.She acted quickly this morning to ensure she stays in power - after Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell started talking of getting into No10 by the back door with a potential left-wing coalition.The runners and riders who could replace the PMTheresa May looks likely to form a government but her position as PM looks less secure, here are those tipped to topple her, writes Alain Tolhurst.Boris Johnson (evens)The Foreign Secretary has long held ambitions for the top job, but was thwarted by his erstwhile running mate Michael Gove last year.Would relish another opportunity, and instantly became the bookies favourite to take over when the dreadful exit poll came out.A video of him refusing to say whether he would still support Theresa May this morning will hav done little to quell concerns in No10 he is plotting a coup.Amber Rudd (4/1)It nearly all went horribly wrong for the Home Secretary this election after a recount was required for her to keep her Hastings and Rye seat.She eventually held on with a wafer-thin majority of 346, keeping her in the hunt to turn her impressive campaign performances into a leadership bid.Stuck with a tough brief and being unable to attack her predecessor (as she happens to be her boss), she has proved a capable performer.Philip Hammond (14/1)The Chancellor came under fire earlier this year for his hated “white van tax”, and was forced to U-turn on the National Insurance rise.That was the first blot on the otherwise immaculate copybook of the man known as “spreadsheet Phil”, who has now held several top Cabinet posts.Like Mrs May a reluctant Brexiteer, he could take over if a steady hand on the tiller is what’s required.George Osborne (25/1)He may no longer be in Parliament but with his coruscating election coverage he is undoubtedly the Tory who had the best campaign.Taking out revenge on the PM for kicking him out of the Cabinet his Evening Standard front pages have been a constant thorn in her side.Counting against him is that he would need a friendly Tory to step aside to trigger a by-election so he can re-join the Commons – and his brand is still toxic among certain groups – but he still attracts a large following among Tory MPs.Courtesy of Sun BetsSWNS43 Supporters celebrate as Thangam Debbonaire wins Bristol West constituency for Labour We have a hung parliament - so what happens next?As the current Prime Minister and leader of the largest party in Parliament, Theresa May has the right to have first go at forming a government.She appears to have struck an informal deal with the Democratic Unionist Party to support a minority government when needed.To stay in power the PM will have to win a vote on her overall policy programme within two weeks, following the Queen's Speech on June 19.If she does make an arrangement with the DUP, she will almost certainly win that vote - but if she has not, she could lose it and her government would fall.Then Jeremy Corbyn would have a chance to strike his own deal with the smaller left-wing parties.This is unlikely to succeed because the total number of seats won by Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens is less than those won by the Tories alone.If neither main party leader could form a government, new elections would be held in the autumn.The DUP have pledged to support them in a ""confidence and supply"" deal - which is not a formal coalition, but an agreement only to help them on a vote-by-vote basis.A source told The Guardian: “We want there to be a government. We have worked well with May. The alternative is intolerable.“For as long as Corbyn leads Labour, we will ensure there’s a Tory PM.”Despite her strong exterior, she will now be facing serious questions about her leadership - especially after alienating many of her Cabinet and backbenchers over her close relationship to her two aides.A considerable amount of blame for the election strategy has landed on Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill today for running a cosy campaign which failed to communicate with her wider team.Despite riding high in the polls for months, the PM threw it all away with a gamble that has not paid off for her.The DUP has been opposed to Jeremy Corbyn's leadership ever since he took office, upset by his past associations with Republicans from the province.Back in November 2015 their Westminster leader Nigel Dodds blasted his top team in the Commons.He said: ""There has been no enemy of Britain’s they haven’t defended, no cause of this country they haven’t denigrated, no security service they haven’t scorned and abused.""These men are unfit to oppose and their opposition to action doesn’t stem from the sincere scruples I, or my colleagues, or the Foreign Affairs Committee share.""Speaking during a debate on airstrikes in Syria he said: ""It’s the petulant, putrid response of the irresponsible revolutionary bedsit they barely seem to have clambered out of.""No more time should be wasted on the opinions of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell.""And for Labour and the country’s sake, I hope Labour MPs waste no more time either. They have very little time left.""Mrs May was set to deliver a speech on the steps of Downing Street and reveal her next move, but this has been scrapped for the meantime as the Tories try to sort out the wreckage of a race they seemed set to win easily just a few weeks ago.AP43 Mr Corbyn appears to touch the breast of Labour's shadow foreign Secretary Emily ThornberryPA43 Ms Sturgeon stopped for a selfie with supporters - despite a poor night for her partyGetty Images43 After a turbulent night we have ended up with a hung parliamentEPA43 The SNP lost 21 seats in a bad night for the nationalist partyInstead of providing ""strong and stable"" leadership she has plunged the country's future into doubt, and having called the election to get a mandate for the tough Brexit talks in the days ahead, EU chiefs are likely to see her weaker than before.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, tweeted: “Brexit negotiations should start when UK is ready; timetable and EU positions are clear.“Let's put our minds together on striking a deal.”And Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council.

after being gunned down by cops.One of the twisted attackers was pictured wearing an Arsenal football strip from the 2011/12 season.Witness Erick Siguenza told BBC News that one of the gang screamed “This is for Allah” as he went on a stabbing rampage in the busy central London streets.The gang had metal canisters strapped to their chests which police chief Rowley confirmed were hoax suicide vests.Former intelligence chief Richard Kemp says it's time to 'take the gloves off' and calls for every cop to be armedFROM looking at what’s going on it looks likely the government wouldn’t have had intelligence.The reality is that even an attack which involves knives is hard for the government to get information about, because it doesn’t require much preparation.There is obviously a direct link to previous ISIS attacks that have been carried out, either at the direction of ISIS or being inspired by ISIS but also, the timing of these attacks is related to two things – one is Ramadan.During Ramadan we always expect to see a higher level of violence from ISIS and we’ve seen that around the world, and now in London.The other thing is the election; carrying out an attack during an election period gives ISIS fighters credit.It’s very likely the people involved will have been known and the way to deal with it therefore is to get rid of similar people before they carry attacks like these out in future.We can do that by deporting people who are not British citizens and who are known to be terrorists, by detaining those who are and by excluding those who are ISIS fighters returning from Iraq and Syria.I’m not confident the government will do this.I don’t know if any politician in the UK will do that – they will in due course, because if they don’t these attacks will continue and they’ll have to.But for right now, the most likely thing is we’ll see the threat level increase, more armed troops and police as an immediate measure.I doubt it would have made any difference if the national threat level had remained at critical.That being said, the elements of it being critical which included military forces and additional police should be reverted because it allows for quicker reactions.We need to consider that this level of threat is going to continue for some time.We should be convicting people involved in radicalisation. It’s time to take the gloves off and hit very, very hard now.We need to detain, export and exclude terrorists.We also need to have every cop in this country armed, which gives us a greater chance of having an immediate response.There was very quick response here, but that’s due to proximity to the scene, which unfortunately doesn’t apply everywhere.Following the rampage four explosions - confirmed as controlled blasts by the police - were heard outside The Sun offices near London Bridge between 1:23am and 1:49am.At least two cops were injured including a British Transport Police officer who was stabbed in the face by the sick extremists - the officer's injuries are not life threatening.Another of the cops injured was a rugby player who armed with just a baton took on the three knife-wielding terrorists as he battled to help innocent victims.Met police have confirmed that the attacks in London Bridge and Borough Market were ""terror incidents"", with Amber Rudd adding that a connection to the Manchester Attack is unlikely but can not be ruled out.51 Officers are pictured treating a woman believed to have suffered a fit in London BridgeWe pay for your stories!

This is what you should do to vote in today's general election The final seven days of the campaign will see the PM mount an all-out assault to persuade UKIP, Labour and even Lib Dem Brexiteers to defect over to her.That even means treating the fast approaching poll on June 8 as a re-run of last summer’s referendum vote, the PM will insist.Speaking in the North East – which voted overwhelmingly for Brexit – Mrs May will tell Leavers it is “time to act on their decision” and “deliver their will”.She will argue: “We are now 12 months on from the EU referendum.PA:Press Association5 The PM will try and persuade Ukip, Labour and even Lib Dem Brexiteers to defect over to her“And in one week’s time, they have the opportunity to affirm that decision and secure that brighter future by voting for me to continue as Prime Minister.“We can fulfil the promise of Brexit together and build a Britain that is stronger, fairer and even more prosperous than it is today.“Because the promise of Brexit is great, the opportunities before us enormous”.As well as making the country “a great, global trading nation once again”, Brexit is also a chance for a major national renewal internally.The PM will say: “As we come together behind this great national mission, we will build a more united country as our shared values, interests and aspirations bring us together”.Reuters5 May came under pressure for failing to appear on the leaders' debateShe will also say that means “making the most of every talent and ensure no person or community is left behind”.Allying her personal ambitions with the vision, Mrs May will insist that is “what motivates me to do what I do and put myself at the service of ordinary working people”.Brexit will again become the central issue in the election campaign today, as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also makes at speech on Britain’s future outside the EU today under a Labour government.Later tomorrow, Mrs May will ram home her plea by campaigning in a Midlands seat always traditionally held by Labour, and now with a 9,000 majority.The PM went on the defensive by visiting South West Tory-held marginals in Plymouth and Bath yesterday.PA:Press Association5 Jeremy Corbyn will also make a speech on Britain’s future outside the EU today under a Labour governmentBut she batted away claims that meant she was running scared after polls showed the race with Labour tightening.Mrs May also faced questions for the first time over whether she will resign if the Tories lose seats next Thursday, after a rogue poll predicted voters could deliver a hung Parliament.Dodging the question, she insisted: “There is only one poll that matters and that’s the poll that takes place on June 8 and when it comes to that poll people have a very clear choice and that choice is about who is going to be the Prime Minister”.The Tories were given a boost last night when the Financial Times became the first national newspaper to give the party its endorsement.The paper for business bosses has previously switched between Labour and the Tories in past elections, but it declared last night: “Faced with such uncertainty at home and abroad, Mrs May is the safer bet”."

Such devices are extremely difficult to get right.""Getting all that to work in the right order and at the right time is very technical. The skills needed are not something that can be acquired easily and I would think it is highly unlikely that the suicide bomber is the bomb maker.""Getty Images16 Hundreds of tributes have been laid at the site of the attackSWNS:South West News Service16 Armed police outside Manchester Piccadilly train station during rush hour this morningRaffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at Royal United Services Institute, says the security forces will be trying to find out if Abedi made the nail bomb himself or if he was given it by an expert bomb-maker.He said; ""A device has been successfully detonated. It is not a pressure cooker device, so he has not just attached something to it to make it blow up, it is an explosive device which takes some skill and training with chemicals.""So the concern is whether someone gave it to him and there is a bomb-maker out there or whether the attacker was trained and built the bomb himself.""They will be looking into whether that knowledge came from outside sources or whether it is still out there.""We know it was a shrapnel bomb and it was in a bag he put down on the ground. We can draw from the fact it works and went off when he wanted to demonstrates a certain level of skill and sophistication, something you don't see in a pressure cooker bomb.""Security services are today probing if Abedi, whose parents came to the UK from Tripoli in the early 1990s, had links to two infamous ISIS recruiters.An investigation is under way into his possible ties with fellow Mancunian Raphael Hostey, also known as Abu Qaqa al-Britani.Abedi was believed to be a family friend of Hostey, who persuaded hundreds of Brits to head to Syria and fight for ISIS. He was killed in a drone strike in May last year, aged 24.Describing him during the trial of another radicalised Brit who had hoped to travel to Syria, a judge said of Hostey: “He has become an inspirational figure, encouraging others to travel and join in with Jihad.”It's reported Abedi  been in contact with Hostey in the run up to his death and another well-known ISIS figure Abdalraouf Abdallah.Abdallah, 23, was jailed for five and a half years in July after being convicted of trying to help other Manchester-based wannabe jihadis to join ISIS.Abdalraouf, who like Abedi, was the son of Libyan dissidents, travelled to Libya in 2010 on a gap year and joined an Islamist extremist group.During one anti-Gaddafi rally, he was shot and paralysed and left confined to a wheelchair.On his return to Manchester he began encouraging friends and associates to join ISIS.Killer Abedi, 22,  is thought to have returned to the UK from Libya as recently as this week.It was also claimed last night that he had travelled by train from London to Manchester on Monday in advance of the attack.This has raised suspicions that he may have met co-conspirators or been supplied with his explosive device by an as-yet-unidentified bombmaker.He was not, however, one of the 350 returning jihadis on the MI5's watchlist.Social Media16 Raphael Hostey, also known as Abu Qaqa al-Britani, was an ISIS recruiterA team including 30 armed officers raided the suicide bomber’s home in the Fallowfield area and police were seen recovering a book called Know Your Chemicals.Abedi born in Manchester and grew up in tight-knit Libyan community that was known for its strong opposition to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi’s regime.His older brother Ismail had been a tutor at Didsbury mosque’s Koran school.One imam said last night said that Salman Abedi, who wore Islamic dress, had shown him “the face of hate” when he gave a talk warning on the dangers of so-called ISIS.The imam of Didsbury Mosque, Mohammed Saeed said Salman stopped going to the mosque in 2015 as he objected to anti- ISIS comments.He said: ""Salman used to come to the mosque occasionally, he wasn't particularly friendly towards me because he didn't like my anti-ISIS sermons.""He didn't like what I was saying and showed me the face of hate. He came to the mosque less and less after that.'""Born in 1994, the second youngest of four children, Abedi’s parents were Libyan refugees who fled to the UK to escape Gaddafi.His mother, Samia Tabbal, 50, and father, Ramadan Abedi, a security officer, were both born in Tripoli but appear to have emigrated to London before moving to the Whalley Range area of south Manchester where they had lived for at least a decade.Today neighbours described the family as very traditional.""The family is super religious,"" one neighbour, who did not want to be named, said.

by accidentally discovering a way to halt it spreading.The anonymous ""hero"" found that by registering a simple website name for less than a tenner, he caused the malware to ""exit"" every time it infected a new machine.Follow our guide to check you're not at risk from the superbug and find out how to protect your computer.It comes as the NHS was slammed by a top minister for failing to protect computers from the massive cyber attack.Europol is working with countries hit to rein in the threat, help victims and track down the perpertrators.Hundreds of operations have been cancelled and patients turned away from A&E at hospitals across the UK, while Sunderland's Nissan plant was hit last night.Home Secretary Amber Rudd today slammed the NHS and said it was ""disappointing"" it had failed to update its systems, which she claims Heath Secretary Jeremy Hunt had ordered health trusts to do.Some NHS trusts are understood to be still using the outdated operating system Windows XP, which Microsoft stopped supporting in 2014.Others may have failed to install a ""critical"" software update in March which would have protected them against the virus, experts warned.EPA23 Home Secretary Amber Rudd, pictured outside Downing Street last week, is due to attend a Cobra meeting after slamming the NHS for failing to update its systemsHackers using malware ""stolen from the NSA"" crippled 45 NHS trusts and caused disruption across at least 45,000 computer networks in 99 countries in the unprecedented global attack yesterday.The tools used to carry out the hack - dubbed a superweapon - are thought to be a surveillance tool developed by the US's National Security Agency to spy on terrorists and enemy states.The ""exploit"", called EternalBlue, was stolen and dumped online by the sinister Shadow Brokers last month.A Brit tech blogger has been praised as a ""hero"" after he managed to halt the spread of the virus by accident.But he urged people to update their operating systems to ensure they are protected, amid fears the virus could still cause chaos.Prime Minister Theresa May thanked NHS staff for working overnight to make sure patient records hadn't been affected.The massive security breach has sparked concerns over countries hoarding intelligence for offensive purposes instead of alerting tech companies to potential flaws.The NHS is predicted to reel for weeks with delays and disruptions.Home Secretary Amber Rudd told Sky News that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had ordered trusts to move off XP, which most had done.She said no patient data had been stolen, but the government didn't yet know who launched the attack or whether it was directed by a foreign government.Malwaretech23 A map shows the spread of the virus, which has now infected computers in 99 countriesShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the virus wasn't directly targeting NHS and ""feels random"".Just a day before Friday's attack a doctor gave a chilling warning that hospitals ""will almost certainly be shut down by ransomware this year"".Ms Rudd will chair a Cobra meeting at 2.30pm this afternoon.Dr Krishna Chinthapalli, a neurology registrar at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, made the prediction in an article in the British Medical Journal.How a Brit tech blogger accidentally found a way to stop the virus spreadingA BRIT blogger has been dubbed an “accidental hero” after he found a way to halt the global spread of the WannaCry virus.The 22-year-old, who runs malwaretech.com, registered the domain name which the virus tries to contact when it infects a new target.The virus has a security feature – which experts suspect is an emergency stop button included by the hackers – which means it only spreads if it can’t connect with that address.If it does connect, it shuts itself down immediately, reports thedailybeast.com.But the hacker didn’t register the domain name for the address, so MalwareTech swooped in and registered it himself for just £8.29.He has since been praised for dramatically slowing the spread of the virus, although he warned others hackers only need to change some code before they can start again.He tweeted: “I will confess that I was unaware registering the domain would stop the malware until after I registered it, so initially it was accidental.""He urged people to patch their systems to protect themselves.Ryan Kalember, of Californian security firm Proofpoint, told The Guardian: ""They get the accidental hero award of the day.""The Home Secretary said she expected NHS trusts to modernise systems after the attack, which has affected 45 NHS organisations.In December, 90 per cent of NHS trusts were reportedly still using the ageing operating system Windows XP - which Microsoft stopped supporting in 2014.Ms Rudd said: ""Windows XP is not a good platform for keeping your data as secure as the modern ones, because you can't download the effective patches and anti-virus software for defending against viruses.""She said the CQC does cyber checks on hospitals, adding: ""I think that after this experience, I would expect them all to move forward with modernising.""Ms Rudd insisted the UK is a world leader in cyber security, saying: ""So far, all we have seen is patients inconvenienced, some hospitals, some doctors making changes to their daily life.""But the fact is no data has yet been accessed and the NHS are brilliantly managing to weave through this disruption.""And for those computers running newer systems, Microsoft reportedly provided a free software update to provide protection in March.Ross Anderson, of Cambridge University, told The Guardian the “critical” software patch may not have been installed across NHS computers.Sky News23 Anthony Brett, who was expecting to have an operation to treat his cancer, but was frustrated to find it had been cancelledHe said: ""If large numbers of NHS organisations failed to act on a critical notice from Microsoft two months ago, then whose fault is that?""He told The Telegraph it was the ""sort of thing for which the secretary of state should get roasted in Parliament.""Europol said today the global cyber attack was on an ""unprecedented level"".It comes a day after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order targeting the government's vulnerability to cyber threats.A major operation has been launched by the National Cyber Security Centre in response to the massive attack.Twitter23 Trusts across the country were affected by the large scale attackAmong the patients affected was Anthony Brett, 50, due to have a stent put in his liver for cancer treatment at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London on May 12, who was told his records couldn't be accessed.He said: ""There are so many corporations out there they could be getting money from, but to do it to the NHS that does so much good for people, it's just disgusting.""They should be hung drawn and quartered.""And a 61-year-old man due to go under the knife for major heart surgery after months of waiting was left distraught when it was cancelled at the eleventh hour due to the hack.WHICH TRUSTS ARE AFFECTED?A LIST of NHS trusts who have fallen victim to the attack so far:Northumbria HealthcareNorth Cumbria HospitalsMorecambe Bay HospitalsBlackpool HospitalsSouthport HospitalEast Lancashire TrustBarts HealthEast and North HertfordshireDerbyshire Community HealthUniversity Hospitals North MidlandsNorth Essex Partnership University FTLondon North West Healthcare TrustYork HospitalsEast Cheshire TrustAintree University HospitalsThe Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Hospitals TrustLiverpool Community TrustUnited Lincolnshire HospitalsJames Paget University Hospital FTBasildon And Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation TrustMid Essex Hospital Services NHS TrustColchester Hospital University NHS Foundation TrustGeorge Eliot Hospital NHS TrustWrightington, Wigan And Leigh NHS Foundation TrustCheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation TrustNottinghamshire Healthcare NHS TrustBurton Hospitals NHS Foundation TrustBirmingham Community Healthcare TrustSherwood Forest HospitalsIpswich HospitalWest Herfordshire HospitalsBarnsley HospitalCentral Manchester University HospitalsAs well as the computer admin systems, services crucial to front-line work including X-rays, test results and doctor's bleep systems were affected.However, there are no reports of the hack compromising vital systems such as life support machines.Some NHS trusts were unable to carry out emergency MRI and CT scans as doctors reverted to using pen and paper amid the chaos.NHS England declared a major incident in the wake of the attack.One doctor tweeted minutes after the attack: ""Massive NHS hack cyber attack today. Hospital in shut down. Thanks for delaying emergency patient care & endangering lives. A******s.""Who are the Shadow Brokers and what is EternalBlue?The Shadow Brokers are a group of hackers who emerged last August when they leaked some of the US NSA’s hacking tools online, sparking alarm worldwide.These included “exploits” used to take control of networks through firewalls, anti-virus software Microsoft products.One of these tools is EternalBlue, which targets a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows.The cyber gang stole the tool - which the NSA developed to spy on terrorists and enemy states - in April.The bug was dumped online just after Donald Trump ordered an airstrike in Syria, leading some to believe the Shadow Brokers have links to the Russian government.EternalBlue is the exploit which has been used to cripple the NHS and other computer systems in 99 countries.The hackers used EternalBlue to spread a ransomware virus called WannaCry, which is known as a computer “worm” because it replicates itself to rapidly spread between computers. Trust staff: we are aware of the national cyber attack - DO NOT open any emails that have “Clinical Results” in the title or similar.— East Kent Hospitals (@EKHUFT) May 12, 2017EPA23 Emergency vehicles have been diverted as operations have been postponed in the wake of the attackStaff described computers going down one by one as the devastating attack took hold, as experts now say they warned of vulnerabilities in the systems for months.Prime Minister Theresa May said yesterday evening the massive cyber attack was part of a wider international attack.She added there was no evidence patient data has been compromised.Earlier in the day, the same ransomware hit Telefonica - the owner of O2 - and other huge organisations in Spain.Nissan's Sunderland plant has been hit by the attack, while Renault confirmed its French sites had been forced to cease production.Cyber attacks have been reported in 99 countries had been reported, including Italy, Portugal, Russia, Vietnam, Kazakhstan and Taiwan.Intelligence services in Romania said they intercepted an attempted cyber attack on a government institution likely to have come from the cybercriminal group known as Fancy Bear.And Russia's Interior Ministry also came under attack, as well as courier firm FedEx.China's Xinhua news agency said some of its schools and universities had been hit.Even Germany's main train operator Deutsche Bahn appeared to have been attacked as images of a train timetable with the hacker's warning message appeared on social media.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt was briefed by the National Cyber Security Centre as Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon chaired a resilience meeting following the attack.Scotland has seen 11 out of 14 health boards affected by the attack where those behind it demanded a bitcoin ransom in what is believe to be the biggest ransomware outbreak in history.Computers in thousands of locations were locked by a programme that demands payment of $300 (£230) in bitcoin -

Cyber hack software that has crippled the NHSRansomware is a virus which takes over a device (or computer) and freezes its files.Hackers use it to hold the recipient to ransom, asking for money in return for access to their documents.The ransomware is spread by accidentally clicking a bad link.It’s often shared in an email, or in some cases hackers could booby-trap a website they know employees will visit, like a government portal.In the case of the NHS, the virus could block access to patient data or operation schedules.As hospital bosses are left frantically trying to access the corrupted files, hackers will step in to ask for money in return.Professor Alan Woodward, visiting Professor of Computing, University of Surrey, said: “The flaw it appears to be exploiting means that it acts as a ‘worm’ i.e. once inside a network it seeks out and affects any susceptible computer it can find on the network.""The only sensible way to tackle it is to ‘pull the plug’ so that it can’t spread any more until you can isolate the affected machines and work out a remediation plan.""Security experts always advise against paying a ransom, as hackers will often destroy the files anyway.Criminal gangs are known to send out thousands of these emails, called phishing scams, in the hope that just a few will click on the link.To protect yourself, visit the Action Fraud websiteColchester Hospital warned A&E is only open for ""critical or life-threatening situations requiring medical attention, such as loss of consciousness, heavy blood loss"".A Barts spokesman said it was experiencing ""major IT disruption"" and delays at all four of its hospitals, The Royal London, St Bartholomew's, Whipps Cross and Newham.He said: ""We have activated our major incident plan to make sure we can maintain the safety and welfare of patients.""We are very sorry that we have to cancel routine appointments, and would ask members of the public to use other NHS services wherever possible.""We have activated our major incident plan to make sure we can maintain the safety and welfare of patientsBarts spokesmanA source at Whipps Cross Hospital in London said: “It’s madness. We’ve had to cancel appointments and operations.“We can’t get blood results or even do X-rays.""Members of staff at The Royal London Hospital were told not to touch their computers following the attack, one employee said.Handwritten signs at the hospital's entrance in east London warned patients of the situation: ""The emergency department has no IT facilities, there are significant delays occurring.""Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust, which sees 4,000 patients a day across Derbyshire and parts of Leicestershire, said all of its IT systems had been ""shut down"".East and North Hertfordshire NHS also confirmed they experienced a “major IT problem, believed to be caused by a cyber attack”.Why would you cyber attack a hospital and hold it for ransom?

If there is money to be made by crippling a machine, they will do that.”23 A number of hospitals are reporting problems with their IT systemsMorrison said hackers typically attack a hospital by including a virus in a spam email, either as a link or attachment.Speaking at the King’s Fund Annual Conference in Central London, he added: “This is malware that infects you, encrypts as much information as it can, and then demands [money] to free it.”Security consultant Tony McDowell said Russian hackers were the likely “prime suspect” and accused them of “posturing”.Twitter23 The hackers have been slammed on social media for targeting the NHSTwitter23 The attack affected patients who were turned away from A&EMr Inkster told Sky News the full story will take some time to emerge.But, he said: ""This highlights a number of points, one is just how vulnerable patient data has become,"" he warned.""It's one most valuable commodities on the internet.""Secondly to be blunt, there are some real issues with NHS trust cyber security many trusts, in excess of 40 are using Windows XP software, which have not been supported by Microsoft two to three years.""He said in the aftermath, patients deserve to know more about what is done with their medical and personal information.We pay for your stories!

Reading these on ideas for the husband right now”.Even though the group has attracted a backlash, it’s yet to be shut down.If users are offended by the page, the moderators warn them to ignore it or get permanently blocked.Facebook8 One member even proudly claimed that she had been arrested for domestic violenceThe rules read: “BGA is a group designed for a specific audience.“We want BGA filled with truly entertaining, shocking, R rated pics/stories, hilarious dark humour and offensive content.“If you see something you do not agree with or something that offends you, you have two choices — Ignore it and scroll by or get blocked from BGA permanently.”Facebook8 One paranoid user admitted to violent acts... before remarking that there might be members of the police lurking on the groupWhen one internet user complained to Facebook, they were allegedly told that the group didn’t breach the Community Standards guidelines.The Bad Girls Advice member told news.com.au: “Thanks for your report — you did the right thing by letting us know about this.“We looked over the group you reported an, and though it doesn’t go against one of our specific Community Standards, we understand the group or something shared in it may still be offensive or distasteful to you.Facebook8 Others used the forum as a way to find their friends new sexual partnersIt added: “We want to help you see less of things like this in the future.“If you want us to look at something specific in this or another group, you can report that exact content (ex: photo) instead of the entire group.”It’s not the first time that sickening Facebook groups have been exposed online.The Sun recently revealed that trolls gathered on a vile “banter page” to share memes about slavery, rape and abortion."

Two blacked-out people carriers pull up to our studio door, spilling an entourage of at least six, including a big, burly security guard.Fabulous11 Will.i.am is the only Voice UK judge to have been on the series since it started in 2012But The Voice UK judge, who’s on our screens for the final of the ITV show tonight, is in no hurry to emerge.Mixed messages slowly feed back – “he’s asleep”, “he’s on the phone” – before Will, 42, finally appears. It’s certainly worth the wait.During our interview, even the simplest of questions can elicit a conversational tangent about anything from sushi to space travel.Rex11 Will is enjoying his new home at ITV alongside fellow judges Jennifer Hudson, Tom Jones, Gavin Rossdale (left to right)Earlier this year, Will made the move over to ITV with The Voice UK when it was poached from the BBC for £335million, making him the only judge to have been on every series since the show’s launch in 2012.Will is clearly enjoying his new home alongside Tom Jones, Jennifer Hudson and Gavin Rossdale, as he’s already confirmed he’ll be back in the chair next year.“I had a blast on the BBC, but ITV is really doing a job at making it theirs.”MOST READ IN FABULOUSBOT'S UP DOC I covered medics, my baby and the wall with a huge poo explosion during labour ROYALLY SWEET The Queen paid tribute to Meg when out with Kate by repeating wedding outfit THICK AND FAB ‘Slim Thick’ is THE body shape celebs are striving for this summer FEELING BLUE Woman turns into Smurf when bath bomb dyed her skin blue after just 5 minutes MYSTIC MEG May 22: Love choices will happen in a rush as you feel pressured by your looks BARELY THERE Fashion Nova launches plastic strap bikinis leaving NOTHING to the imagination In 2016, a three-page list titled “Tips for maximizing your interview time with will.i.am” went viral (“Questions should be one sentence… straightforward” and “Avoid asking questions that will require repeating information already shared”).Thankfully, there aren’t any pointer sheets handed out on Will’s first Fabulous cover shoot today – although it soon becomes clear that some topics are strictly off-limits.Take, for instance, whether he’s looking for a relationship.Fabulous11 Will.i.am's love life remains a bit of an enigma as he refuses to discuss it“Um,” he replies, “I go to [posh London sushi restaurant] Nobu every Tuesday and I love that yellowtail jalapeño. It means I love sushi. Yeah, I’m cool.”Before we get a chance to push for clarification, his manager interjects – no more questions on the subject.William James Adams Jr was raised in the Estrada Courts housing projects in the poor East LA neighbourhood of Boyle Heights by single mum Debra, along with two brothers and a sister.Poverty remains rife and education levels low there – crime rates are 47% higher than the national average with 13 murders over the past year.Fabulous11 Will.i.am was brought up by single mum Debra in an impoverished east LA neighbourhood“Gangs, guns, warring between the gangs, cops warring with the gangs, cops shooting kids, kids shooting cops. It was bad. But my mum kept us safe.”Keen to give her son the best start in life, Debra encouraged Will to be unique and refused to send him to the local Theodore Roosevelt Senior High.Instead, from the age of seven he made a four-hour-round bus trip to attend schools in the upmarket Brentwood area, which focused on science and technology.It was while attending John Marshall High School that he became best friends with Allan Pineda Lindo AKA apl.de.ap (who Will simply refers to as “Apple”), later forming The Black Eyed Peas.Gangs, guns, warring between the gangs, cops warring with the gangs, cops shooting kids, kids shooting cops. It was bad. But my mum kept us safe.Will.i.amAnother potential obstacle that Will overcame as a child was possible attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).“I believe whoever came up with ADHD was just trying to sell medicine. I think it’s called: ‘You’re creative and you can focus on more things’.“Maybe the school system needs to be a little more flexible for all different types of learning needs. Those that don’t fit in that box, there’s no other box for them, so doctors say: ‘You have ADHD,’ and try and tame the mind to be like the other minds.“Every person I know, who’s a little ‘off’, is the most creative. Their hyperactivity means they’re capable of taking on a bunch of things at once. Thank god my mum never put me on [anti-hyperactivity drug] Ritalin.”Fabulous11 Will.i.am is grateful for his ADHD and credits it for his creativity and ability to work harder than anyoneHe adds: “I’ve learned how to work the ‘H’ in ADHD to my benefit. I can work longer hours than anyone on this planet. It so happens that my work is around creativity so I can go and go and go. I could work 20-hour days.“The ADD part, well that means I’m a good multitasker. I know there’s a difference between ADHD, like I have, and borderline chemically imbalanced. But there’s a way to balance your own chemicals without chemicals.”It’s at this point he reveals for the first time that he’s battled depression: “I knew something was wrong with me. My grandma and my uncle helped me. Depression, anxiety, panic attacks – I’ve had those. Those are bad.”However, that’s as far as he’ll go on the subject.I’ve learned how to work the ‘H’ in ADHD to my benefit.Will.i.amAsking him when he suffered from depression elicits an: “I don’t like to talk about that kind of stuff. Some people, when they talk about it, they are induced. Just the idea of thinking about it can bring on [an episode]. I might go: [Shouts and waves his hands around] ‘Wah!’ [Long laugh] ‘He’s throwing bricks in here!’”What is clear is that his early life gave Will a drive to succeed.Aged 11, he started dreaming big and became determined to pull his family out of poverty.He formed what was to become The Black Eyed Peas in 1992, when he was 17, alongside apl.de.ap, now 42, and another childhood friend, Taboo (Jaime Luis Gomez), 41, and in 2003 they recruited Fergie (Stacy Ferguson), 42.Getty11 Will.i.am formed what was to become The Black Eyed Peas when he was 17, alongside apl.de.ap (centre right)Their first major hit came soon after, with Where Is The Love? featuring Justin Timberlake spending six weeks at No.1 in the UK.They racked up four UK No.1 singles before going on a hiatus in 2011.“I moved my mum out the ghetto when I was 23,” he smiles.“That was always my dream. That’s your gasoline and electricity. Or else what are you doing it for? OK, you’re doing it to get rich – you’re getting rich for what? Just to have it? Then you’re going to be spending it on bulls**t and have a mouth riddled with gold. All of that’s cool, but it was never my thing.”But Will’s generosity didn’t stop there.Fabulous11 Will moved his mum out of the getto when he was 23 and the rest of the family when he was 30“I moved my entire family out of the ghetto when I was 30. I had to make that happen. My aunties, uncles, brothers, my grandma… There was about 30 of us. I moved them all out.”The star has a strong bond with his mum, who raised him alone and adopted four children – two girls and two boys – as well as having her own four.“She was an anchor, but my mum’s mum was her anchor. My grandma was a dominant force in all of our lives. She was my date to the Grammys.”He certainly doesn’t seem fussed about never knowing his father, maintenance worker William Adams Sr, who left before Will was born.“My mum’s awesome. She’s like my dad, too. Every Father’s Day I say: ‘Happy Father’s Day, Mum.’ My uncle’s been like a dad. My ‘Duncle’.”In a celebrity world full of temptation, these strong female role models taught Will to have respect for women.“I’m very sensitive. I’m respectful but I’m a man still. I’m still a dude! But I’m not like [gruff voice]: ‘Hey girl!’ I don’t know how to be that way, even if I wanted to. A guy is never really a good boyfriend. A girl makes a guy a good boyfriend.”While it’s clear Will’s main woman is his mum, his love life remains a bit of an enigma.He’s previously spoken about an ex-girlfriend he dated for eight years and who inspired the band’s Top 10 hit Don’t Lie, and he has also been linked to Natalie Imbruglia and reality star Casey Batchelor.Planet11 Cheryl collaborated with Will.i.am on his Top 10 solo single Heartbreaker and supported Black Eyed Peas on tourAnd back in 2011 Will discovered what it was like to be in the company of one of the world’s most desirable women, when he was hired to manage the then Cheryl Cole.The pair had formed a close friendship after she collaborated with him on his Top 10 solo single Heartbreaker in 2008 and later supported The Black Eyed Peas on tour.He was brought in to launch her career Stateside, but instead found himself picking up the pieces when Simon Cowell fired her from The X Factor USA. By 2013, Cheryl had fired Will.They were seen together less and less and their relationship appeared strained, with the star kept in the dark when Cheryl married Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini in 2014.EROTEME11 Will was hired to manage the then Cheryl Cole - but she fired him in 2013Tellingly, when asked if he’ll visit Cheryl – who is now with One Direction’s Liam Payne – now she’s given birth, he says: “I’ll see [the baby] on a magazine somewhere.”As to whether they’re still best friends: “Er, I think when you’re close to somebody you’re always close, but I think we’re just… We’re gravitating to new things. Of course we’re still friends. I don’t know where she hangs out – she doesn’t hang out so much any more. I’m happy for her though. When’s her baby due?”Creating a family is on Will’s wish list.However, it’s a distant dream at the minute, with his time being taken up on i.am+, the tech company he founded in 2013, and roles on The Voice UK, The Voice Kids and the Apple reality TV series Planet of The Apps, alongside fellow entrepreneurs Jessica Alba and Gwyneth Paltrow.I think when you’re close to somebody you’re always close, but I think we’re just… We’re gravitating to new things.Will.i.am“Right now, I’m just focusing on completing the dream. What do I want [when I’m aged] 50 to 60 to be like? How do I want to live 50 to 70? I wanna live and I want to be able to do whatever and make sure my kids’ kids don’t have anything to worry about.”Through his i.am.angel foundation, Will is giving back and has raised over £400,000 in financial aid for college students in Boyle Heights.In 2012, he also teamed up with The Prince’s Trust to give £500,000 to schemes with a focus on technology for disadvantaged youngsters.This desire to give back has also meant Will has been inspired by his mum to adopt in the future.“Yeah, that’s on the path. My best friend Apple was adopted. He was sponsored from five and brought to America [from the Philippines] when he was 14. I’m one of the first people he met and we’ve been friends ever since.”Getty11 Will refuses to address rumours there's a new Black Eyed Peas album in the pipelineDespite working with the likes of Britney Spears, Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga – and rumours of a fifth solo album and new Black Eyed Peas album in the pipeline, which he won’t address today – Will’s music career seems to be firmly on the back burner.“I don’t really do music so much,” he shrugs.“From 1995 to 2010, I made music six days a week, 9am-5pm; from 2010 to 2012, five days a week; 2012 to 2015, three days a week; 2015 to 2017, I make music one day a week. My dream is being an entrepreneur – that’s my new music. I have a groove and there are 150 people who work for that groove. It feels like I’m an adult, I go to work and have real problems to solve.”Rex11 Will.i.am is spending less time on music and more on his entrepreneurial endeavoursSo far he’s created a smart watch called Dial and foto.sosho, a fashion accessory/iPhone case that turns your phone into a high-powered camera with a built-in app to edit and share pictures quickly.The seven times Grammy Award winner is going where the money is. And it’s paying off.These days, Will lives in a nine-bedroom house in LA, set over three storeys complete with a studio and a Bentley in the drive.“Music is not sustainable. Only the lucky ones can sustain it for the rest of their life. You have to switch gears.“[With] an album you don’t make no money. Money is what pays for s**t and that’s how you take care of your family. I want to send more kids to college and help more folk in underserved communities.“A lot of people think: ‘But Will, you’re rich.’ Yes, but eventually that’s going to go away. If you have desires of helping folks, unfortunately you need money. I’m not money-driven, I just want to make sure my energy is being put in places where there’s sustainability and I can live a cool, awesome, relaxed, creative, problem-solving life from 50 to 90.“If I want to go to outer space, I want to be like: ‘Hey, let’s go!’ because by the time I’m 50, space travel should be normal. I want to do some crazy, wild s**t.”If anyone will fulfil their space-travel dream, it’s sure to be someone as out of this world as will.i.am.The Voice UK final is on ITV tonight.

Nor was it an attempt to do harm to the European Union or any of the remaining member states.  On the contrary, the United Kingdom wants the European Union to succeed and prosper.  Instead, the referendum was a vote to restore, as we see it, our national self-determination. We are leaving the European Union, but we are not leaving Europe – and we want to remain committed partners and allies to our friends across the continent.Earlier this month, the United Kingdom Parliament confirmed the result of the referendum by voting with clear and convincing majorities in both of its Houses for the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill.  The Bill was passed by Parliament on 13 March and it received Royal Assent from Her Majesty The Queen and became an Act of Parliament on 16 March.Today, therefore, I am writing to give effect to the democratic decision of the people of the United Kingdom. I hereby notify the European Council in accordance with Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union of the United Kingdom’s intention to withdraw from the European Union.  In addition, in accordance with the same Article 50(2) as applied by Article 106a of the Treaty Establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, I hereby notify the European Council of the United Kingdom’s intention to withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community. References in this letter to the European Union should therefore be taken to include a reference to the European Atomic Energy Community.This letter sets out the approach of Her Majesty’s Government to the discussions we will have about the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union and about the deep and special partnership we hope to enjoy – as your closest friend and neighbour – with the European Union once we leave.  We believe that these objectives are in the interests not only of the United Kingdom but of the European Union and the wider world too. It is in the best interests of both the United Kingdom and the European Union that we should use the forthcoming process to deliver these objectives in a fair and orderly manner, and with as little disruption as possible on each side.We want to make sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and is capable of projecting its values, leading in the world, and defending itself from security threats. We want the United Kingdom, through a new deep and special partnership with a strong European Union, to play its full part in achieving these goals. We therefore believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the European Union. The Government wants to approach our discussions with ambition, giving citizens and businesses in the United Kingdom and the European Union – and indeed from third countries around the world – as much certainty as possible, as early as possible. I would like to propose some principles that may help to shape our coming discussions, but before I do so, I should update you on the process we will be undertaking at home, in the United Kingdom.As I have announced already, the Government will bring forward legislation that will repeal the Act of Parliament – the European Communities Act 1972 – that gives effect to EU law in our country.  This legislation will, wherever practical and appropriate, in effect convert the body of existing European Union law (the “acquis”) into UK law.  This means there will be certainty for UK citizens and for anybody from the European Union who does business in the United Kingdom. The Government will consult on how we design and implement this legislation, and we will publish a White Paper tomorrow.We also intend to bring forward several other pieces of legislation that address specific issues relating to our departure from the European Union, also with a view to ensuring continuity and certainty, in particular for businesses.  We will of course continue to fulfil our responsibilities as a member state while we remain a member of the European Union, and the legislation we propose will not come into effect until we leave. From the start and throughout the discussions, we will negotiate as one United Kingdom, taking due account of the specific interests of every nation and region of the UK as we do so.  When it comes to the return of powers back to the United Kingdom, we will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.But it is the expectation of the Government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration. Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union The United Kingdom wants to agree with the European Union a deep and special partnership that takes in both economic and security cooperation.  To achieve this, we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU. If, however, we leave the European Union without an agreement the default position is that we would have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms.In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened.  In this kind of scenario, both the United Kingdom and the European Union would of course cope with the change, but it is not the outcome that either side should seek. We must therefore work hard to avoid that outcome. It is for these reasons that we want to be able to agree a deep and special partnership, taking in both economic and security cooperation, but it is also because we want to play our part in making sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats.And we want the United Kingdom to play its full part in realising that vision for our continent. Looking ahead to the discussions which we will soon begin, I would like to suggest some principles that we might agree to help make sure that the process is as smooth and successful as possible. We should engage with one another constructively and respectfully, in a spirit of sincere cooperation.  Since I became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom I have listened carefully to you, to my fellow EU Heads of Government and the Presidents of the European Commission and Parliament.  That is why the United Kingdom does not seek membership of the single market: we understand and respect your position that the four freedoms of the single market are indivisible and there can be no “cherry picking”.We also understand that there will be consequences for the UK of leaving the EU: we know that we will lose influence over the rules that affect the European economy.  We also know that UK companies will, as they trade within the EU, have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part – just as UK companies do in other overseas markets. We should always put our citizens first.  There is obvious complexity in the discussions we are about to undertake, but we should remember that at the heart of our talks are the interests of all our citizens.  There are, for example, many citizens of the remaining member states living in the United Kingdom, and UK citizens living elsewhere in the European Union, and we should aim to strike an early agreement about their rights. We should work towards securing a comprehensive agreement.We want to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic and security cooperation. We will need to discuss how we determine a fair settlement of the UK’s rights and obligations as a departing member state, in accordance with the law and in the spirit of the United Kingdom’s continuing partnership with the EU.  But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU. We should work together to minimise disruption and give as much certainty as possible.  Investors, businesses and citizens in both the UK and across the remaining 27 member states – and those from third countries around the world – want to be able to plan.  In order to avoid any cliff-edge as we move from our current relationship to our future partnership, people and businesses in both the UK and the EU would benefit from implementation periods to adjust in a smooth and orderly way to new arrangements.  It would help both sides to minimise unnecessary disruption if we agree this principle early in the process. In particular, we must pay attention to the UK’s unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland.  The Republic of Ireland is the only EU member state with a land border with the United Kingdom.  We want to avoid a return to a hard border between our two countries, to be able to maintain the Common Travel Area between us, and to make sure that the UK’s withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland.We also have an important responsibility to make sure that nothing is done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland, and to continue to uphold the Belfast Agreement. We should begin technical talks on detailed policy areas as soon as possible, but we should prioritise the biggest challenges. Agreeing a high-level approach to the issues arising from our withdrawal will of course be an early priority.  But we also propose a bold and ambitious Free Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union. This should be of greater scope and ambition than any such agreement before it so that it covers sectors crucial to our linked economies such as financial services and network industries.  This will require detailed technical talks, but as the UK is an existing EU member state, both sides have regulatory frameworks and standards that already match.  We should therefore prioritise how we manage the evolution of our regulatory frameworks to maintain a fair and open trading environment, and how we resolve disputes.  On the scope of the partnership between us – on both economic and security matters – my officials will put forward detailed proposals for deep, broad and dynamic cooperation.We should continue to work together to advance and protect our shared European values.  Perhaps now more than ever, the world needs the liberal, democratic values of Europe.  We want to play our part to ensure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats. As I have said, the Government of the United Kingdom wants to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic and security cooperation.  At a time when the growth of global trade is slowing and there are signs that protectionist instincts are on the rise in many parts of the world, Europe has a responsibility to stand up for free trade in the interest of all our citizens. Likewise, Europe’s security is more fragile today than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Weakening our cooperation for the prosperity and protection of our citizens would be a costly mistake.The United Kingdom’s objectives for our future partnership remain those set out in my Lancaster House speech of 17 January and the subsequent White Paper published on 2 February. We recognise that it will be a challenge to reach such a comprehensive agreement within the two-year period set out for withdrawal discussions in the Treaty. But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU. We start from a unique position in these discussions – close regulatory alignment, trust in one another’s institutions, and a spirit of cooperation stretching back decades.  It is for these reasons, and because the future partnership between the UK and the EU is of such importance to both sides, that I am sure it can be agreed in the time period set out by the Treaty. The task before us is momentous but it should not be beyond us.  After all, the institutions and the leaders of the European Union have succeeded in bringing together a continent blighted by war into a union of peaceful nations, and supported the transition of dictatorships to democracy.  Together, I know we are capable of reaching an agreement about the UK’s rights and obligations as a departing member state, while establishing a deep and special partnership that contributes towards the prosperity, security and global power of our continent."

All my family were devastated. I don’t want to replicate those emotions.“As a local lad, as a fan of the club you play for, the emotions are always magnified.”7North News and Pictures7 Home-town hero Gibson is idolised by the Boro faithfulNorth News and Pictures7 Gibson knows what damage relegation will do to the communitySince that May day eight years ago, Gibson has gone on to fulfil his dream of climbing through the Riverside ranks and helping Boro return to the top flight, which they did last year.And while his uncle recently said, “nobody will have died and the world will keep spinning” if the club are relegated, Gibson is in no mood to play down the importance of survival.Gibson, an unused sub in the Three Lions’ 2-0 victory over Lithuania on Sunday, said: “We gave everything for seven years to get back here.“We sacrificed a hell of a lot — blood, sweat and tears.“And we know the positive impact it has on the town.“We have definitely seen an upturn in the town’s fortunes — it is thriving at the minute.“So we’ve got to make sure now that we stay here and don’t undo all that hard work — not just for ourselves, but for all the people in the town.”Getty Images7 Gibson is wanted at Manchester City and Chelsea this summerIf all of Middlesbrough’s players shared Gibson’s spirit and passion, you doubt they would be second-bottom, five points from safety.He is a credit to the club on and off the pitch — and they will miss him hugely when he surely moves on to one of the big boys in the near future, with Chelsea and Manchester City both keen.Last week, Gibson surprised two young fans in Redcar after Boro club partners CLS Sports and charity Smile for a Child revamped their back garden with astroturf and safe-play equipment.Cohen Cartwright, seven, and his four-year-old brother Indie both suffer from a rare, life- limiting disability.And Gibson admitted: “It was a real thrill to see the smiles on their faces. It made their day and it will change their lives.“I remember how excited I used to get to see a first-team Middlesbrough player. I still remember getting one of my trophies off Stewart Downing when I was a young lad. So if I can give that same feeling back to fans, that is fantastic.”Gibson has made the transition from Championship to Premier League with ease and looks a natural leader, often wearing the captain’s armband.He is clearly also a strong voice in the dressing room — one which ex-boss Aitor Karanka lost the respect of, costing him his job 12 days ago.But the local lad insists he had no say on the Spaniard’s sacking, even with his family links in the boardroom.Gibson smiled: “No, that’s way above my pay grade. As a home-grown lad, you can have a good influence in the dressing room.“But we have got a good group of people who all believe in each other and really believe we will turn our fortunes around. We have never lost a game because of a lack of fight and that won’t start happening now.”Getty Images7 Under-21s star Gibson was called up to the seniors by Gareth SouthgateReuters7 The Boro defender replaced the crocked Chris SmallingGibson appreciates the influence Karanka had on his game, having only started seven times for Boro before the former Real Madrid defender was appointed in 2013.He admitted: “My career took a massive upturn under the guidance of Aitor. He did a fantastic job for the club, the town and we will for ever be grateful for that.”But now Gibson is fully behind caretaker coach Steve Agnew, who was his reserve-team boss five years ago.He said: “Steve’s demanding, a tough guy.“He’s a fantastic coach and knows the way he wants to play.“He spoke about drip-feeding those ideas to the lads. That doesn’t happen overnight.“You don’t automatically become Barcelona because you’ve a new manager. But the way he wants to play is free-flowing, expansive, creative.“We believe in him, we will back him and we will fight tooth and nail for him.”Gibson is confident Agnew’s appointment can give Boro the lift they need going into the final ten games.They lost their first match under him — 3-1 at home to Manchester United — but visit Swansea on Sunday before dates with Hull and Burnley.Gibson added: “We have ten cup finals on our hands.“We are really looking forward to putting right what has already gone wrong and fixing where we are in the table.“Any change with regards to the manager, most clubs get a reaction and that’s what we need.“We have to use that to gain momentum and to make sure the place is buzzing.”Tweet @dpcoverdale"

I didn’t want to but he persisted. I had been drinking and was very tired – and I truly regret it.The guy is acting as though everything is fine and it was just one of those things but I feel so guilty about it.Getty Images12 I feel terrible about sleeping with himHow I can face my sister? I am terrified she or someone else in the family will find out. They will think I did it on purpose to get at her.It happened after a family party. We were celebrating my sister-in-law’s win on the Lottery. It was not an enormous win but we all thought it was a good excuse for a party.Everyone was there and there was plenty to eat and drink, plus music and a bit of dancing.Alamy12 I am terrified my sister or someone else in the family will find outI am 21 and single. My 24-year-old sister and her boyfriend, who is 29, were there. They had a bit of a tiff over something and she went home.The boyfriend and I followed on an hour or so later and he suggested that I stay there in the spare room. This sounded like a good idea as it was about two in the morning by then.He was very attentive. I thought he was just being kind but after I had taken my dress off and got into bed, he came back and got in with me. He kept trying to kiss me. He kept saying he knew what I wanted.I told him to leave me alone many times and kept saying no, but he persisted and in the end I gave in.Getty Images12 I am also frightened of finding myself alone with him in case he tries it on againI just couldn’t resist any more. I was exhausted and I’d been drinking — but I wasn’t so out of it that I can’t remember what happened.I did have a bit of thing going with him years ago, before my sister started going out with him. I only saw him for a couple of months and decided he was not the one for me.I feel dreadful now. I worry my sister will find out and think it must have been all my fault. She is bound to feel I encouraged him the moment she was out of sight.At the very least she would think I should have fought harder.I am also frightened of finding myself alone with him in case he tries it on again.DEIDRE SAYS:  He is the one who should be feeling guilty. It sounds as though he pressured you so much that it was rape. It certainly wasn’t fully consensual sex.Talk in confidence to Rape Crisis (rapecrisis.org.uk, 0808 802 9999). It will reassure you and help relieve your guilty feelings, as well as advise you about what to doHe deserves you to report him to the police and for your sister to realise what sort of man she is with, but I can see that will take courage and could cause a family rift.Even if you don’t feel able to do that, tell this guy that if he tries anything on with you again you will go to the police. That should be enough to make him leave you alone in future.MOST READ IN DEAR DEIDREDEAR DEIDRE Sex with my husband was out of this world — now he only fancies his 50 pigeons DEIDRE'S PHOTO CASEBOOK Andy's girlfriend wants to have a baby but he's secretly cheating SOME LIKE IT HOT I've been having sex with my lover for years but I just don't fancy her CHILDHOOD TRAUMA I was abused as a child and nightmares ruin any time I spend with my son IS IT AN EXCUSE?

I tried to make amends but she is still resentful and still keeping me apart from our daughter.I think nothing will save our marriage. I packed my bags last week but my wife persuaded me to stay.She can be very manipulative and promised to change but nothing is different.DEIDRE SAYS:  Your marriage never really got off the ground as your wife is so closely bonded with her mum and maybe never saw her dad behaving like an active father.Tell your wife your marriage can survive only if she treats you as a full partner and father to your daughter, and her mum accepts she is grandma and not co-parent.Organise counselling together with Relate (relate.org.uk, 0300 100 1234) but also take the initiative.

I don’t know why.I was bullied at school and that has made me very quiet with other people.I would so like to find someone who would give me the chance to speak to them without ending up feeling insulted or rejected.Everyone I know is in a relationship and some are even cheating on their partners. Meanwhile, I cannot even find one.DEIDRE SAYS:  You have plenty of time to overcome your fears.Look for activities you can join in which appeal to both sexes and give you a shared interest to talk about – for example, a sport or maybe doing some voluntary work.Then ask them questions about themselves – everyone loves talking about themselves.My e-leaflet on Shyness and Social Anxiety will help.Do I pick him or my family?Dear DeidreI HAVE a lovely boyfriend and our little boy adores him but my family hate him.I could not wish for a better partner and father to my child. We have been together for three years. He is 28, I am 22.Getty Images12 My family hate my boyfriendHis ex has said awful things about him – all of it lies. I once had a row with my boyfriend which ended badly. As a result, my family and friends say they will not talk to me ever again if I stay with him.He has asked me to marry him and I agreed on condition that my family do not know. So we argued about it and he withdrew the offer. If I stay with my boyfriend, I will lose my family.But if I stay with the family I love, I will probably lose him.DEIDRE SAYS:  What do you mean by a row that “ended badly”? Do you mean he hit you? If so, no wonder your family and friends are worried and you need to be sure he really has changed. Has he had help with anger management?If you are sure he is the right man for you, be firm with your family. Insist that they cannot run your relationship and your little boy needs his dad.Girlfriend dumped me because I'm poorDear DeidreMY girlfriend dumped me because I couldn’t afford to take her to a posh restaurant.We met online and had been together for five weeks when she said her birthday was approaching.12 She said that having a nice meal out would be great for her birthday but I couldn't afford itI’m 48 and have a job that I love, but it’s not well paid. She is 44.She said that having a nice meal out would be great for her birthday and suggested a particular restaurant.I phoned to book a table and the cheapest deal was £160 for two. That is way out of my league financially.I told my girlfriend that I just couldn’t stretch that far but she said I should have booked it anyway.She dumped me and now I feel used. I thought she was the one for me.DEIDRE SAYS:  No one that mercenary and callous was ever going to make you happy. Try to see what happened as a lucky escape.Loving relationships are not about how much you can spend, so forget about her and move on.121212"

And our resolve will never waiver in the face of terrorism.And we meet here, in the oldest of all Parliaments, because we know that democracy, and the values it entails, will always prevail.Those values – free speech, liberty, human rights and the rule of law – are embodied here in this place, but they are shared by free people around the world.A terrorist came to the place where people of all nationalities and cultures gather to celebrate what it means to be free. And he took out his rage indiscriminately against innocent men, women and children.Mr Speaker, this was an attack on free people everywhere – and on behalf of the British people, I would like to thank our friends and allies around the world who have made it clear that they stand with us at this time.What happened on the streets of Westminster yesterday afternoon sickened us all.While there is an ongoing police investigation, the House will understand that there are limits to what I can say.But having been updated by police and security officials let me set out what at this stage I can tell the House.At approximately 2:40pm yesterday, a single attacker drove his vehicle at speed into innocent pedestrians who were crossing Westminster Bridge, killing 2 people and injuring around 40 more.In addition to 12 Britons admitted to hospital, we know that the victims include 3 French children, 2 Romanians, 4 South Koreans, 1 German, 1 Pole, 1 Irish, 1 Chinese, 1 Italian, 1 American and 2 Greeks.And we are in close contact with the governments of the countries of all those affected.The injured also included 3 police officers who were returning from an event to recognise their bravery. Two of those 3 remain in a serious condition.Mr Speaker, the attacker then left the vehicle and approached a police officer at Carriage Gates, attacking that officer with a large knife, before he was shot dead by an armed police officer.Tragically, as the House will know, 48-year-old PC Keith Palmer, was killed.PC Palmer had devoted his life to the service of his country. He had been a member of the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command for 15 years, and a soldier in the Royal Artillery before that.He was a husband and a father, killed doing a job he loved.He was every inch a hero. And his actions will never be forgotten.I know the whole House will join me in sending our deepest condolences to his family – and to the families and friends of all those who have been killed or injured in yesterday’s awful attacks.I know also that the House will wish to thank all those who acted with such speed and professionalism yesterday to secure this place and ensure we are able to meet as we are doing today.Mr Speaker, at 7:30 last night, I chaired a meeting of the government’s emergency committee COBR and will have further briefings and meetings with security officials today.The threat level to the UK has been set at ‘severe’ – meaning an attack is highly likely – for some time.This is the second highest threat level. The highest level ‘critical’ means there is specific intelligence that an attack is imminent.As there is no such intelligence, the independent Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre has decided that the threat level will not change in the light of yesterday’s attack.Mr Speaker, the whole country will want to know who was responsible for this atrocity and the measures that we are taking to strengthen our security, including here in Westminster.A full counter-terrorism investigation is already underway.Hundreds of our police and security officers have been working through the night to establish everything possible about this attack – including its preparation, motivation and whether there were any associates involved in its planning.And while there remain limits on what I can say at this stage, I can confirm that overnight the police have searched 6 addresses and made 8 arrests in Birmingham and London.Mr Speaker, it is still believed that this attacker acted alone, and the police have no reason to believe there are imminent further attacks on the public.His identity is known to the police and MI5, and when operational considerations allow, he will be publicly identified.What I can confirm is that the man was British born and that some years ago, he was once investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism. He was a peripheral figure.The case is historic – he was not part of the current intelligence picture.There was no prior intelligence of his intent – or of the plot. Intensive investigations continue.And as Acting Deputy Commissioner Rowley confirmed last night, our working assumption is that the attacker was inspired by Islamist ideology.Mr Speaker, we know the threat from Islamist terrorism is very real. But while the public should remain utterly vigilant they should not – and will not – be cowed by this threat.As Acting Deputy Commissioner Rowley has made clear, we are stepping up policing to protect communities across the country and to reassure the public.And as a precautionary measure, this will mean increasing the number of patrols in cities across the country with more police and more armed police on the streets.Since June 2013 our police, security and intelligence agencies have successfully disrupted 13 separate terrorist plots in Britain.Following the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review, we protected the police budgets for counter-terrorism and committed to increase cross-government spending on counter-terrorism by 30% in real terms over the course of this Parliament.And over the next 5 years we will invest an extra £2.5 billion in building our global security and intelligence network, employing over 1,900 additional staff at MI5, MI6 and GCHQ and more than doubling our global network of counter-terrorism experts working with priority countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.Mr Speaker, in terms of security here in Westminster, we should be clear first of all that an attacker attempted to break into Parliament and was shot dead within 20 yards of the gates.If his intention was to gain access to this building, we should be clear that he did not succeed.The police heroically did their job.But as is routine, the police together with the House authorities are reviewing the security of the Parliamentary estate, co-ordinated with the Cabinet Office, who have responsibility for the security measures in place around the government secure zone.All of us in this House have a responsibility for the security and safety of our staff and advice is available for Members who need it.Mr Speaker, yesterday we saw the worst of humanity, but we will remember the best.We will remember the extraordinary efforts to save the life of PC Keith Palmer, including those by my Rt Hon Friend the Member for Bournemouth East.And we will remember the exceptional bravery of our police, security and emergency services who once again ran towards the danger even as they encouraged others to move the other way.On behalf of the whole country I want to pay tribute to them for the work they have been doing to reassure the public, treat the injured and bring security back to the streets of our capital city.That they have lost one of their own in yesterday’s attack only makes their calmness and professionalism all the more remarkable.Mr Speaker, a lot has been said since terror struck London yesterday. Much more will be said in the coming days.But the greatest response lies not in the words of politicians, but in the everyday actions of ordinary people.For beyond these walls today – in scenes repeated in towns and cities across the country – millions of people are going about their days and getting on with their lives.The streets are as busy as ever.The offices full. The coffee shops and cafes bustling.As I speak millions will be boarding trains and aeroplanes to travel to London, and to see for themselves the greatest city on Earth.It is in these actions – millions of acts of normality – that we find the best response to terrorism.A response that denies our enemies their victory. That refuses to let them win. That shows we will never give in.A response driven by that same spirit that drove a husband and father to put himself between us and our attacker, and to pay the ultimate price.A response that says to the men and women who propagate this hate and evil: you will not defeat us.Mr Speaker, let this be the message from this House and this nation today: our values will prevail.And I commend this statement to the House. "

It can’t afford to be out of touch with Brexit voters and towns and villages beyond the great cities where the Corporation is based.Getty Images4 The MPs claimed the corporation can't afford to be out of touch with its Brexit-voting viewers in towns and villages away from the big cities where it's basedMOST READ IN NEWSDYING WISH Single mum loses fight with cancer after asking family 'Look after my boys' ExclusiveROO'S FURY Wayne Rooney livid after bro filmed looking pally in pub loo with Tommy Robinson ZAPPED TO DEATH Toddler killed after putting phone charger in mouth while plugged into wall 'RAPE' RAP Oritse Williams' manager admits touching 'zombified' girl as 'star raped her' 'LOVED LIFE' 'Free spirit' student, 21, dies in hotel after 2 bottles of Prosecco & cocaine COT CLOTS Celebs' pics of babies sleeping in unsafe conditions 'fuelling cot death rise' WarningMOB JUSTICE Furious crowds strip female ‘shoplifters’ naked, batter them and cut their hair PARENTS' WORST NIGHTMARE Boy, 4, found dead by his mum after being electrocuted by lamp ExclusiveULTIMAYTE BETRAYAL Theresa May faces new coup after second EU referendum gamble backfires TILL TOLL Shoppers could soon be charged 1p to use automatic tills “This is especially the case when Local BBC News websites are putting such pressure on local newspapers, who are much more likely to reflect the character of their community than the nearest outpost of the sprawling BBC.”Mr Knight also tore into the broadcaster for allowing itself to be bullied by the SNP, and challenge the party’s “ramshackle record” in office in Scotland.The letter – backed by Tories, Labour and unionist MPs from the DUP - will be seen as a huge warning shot ahead of the critical talks to come.4 Tory MP Steve Baker called for the BBC to treat Brexit with impartiality, claiming he's fed up of its 'sneering tone of voice' on the subjectBrexit-backing Tory MP Steve Baker said: “I am fed up with the sneering tone of voice which is often used by the BBC when discussing Brexit.“We are leaving the EU and it is time the BBC dealt with it and started treating the issue impartially and on behalf of its whole audience, including the millions who voted to leave.”A BBC spokeswoman said: “The BBC is covering the political and financial events following the referendum vote in a responsible and impartial way.“The BBC is also one of the great exports of this country and makes a significant contribution to the UK creative sector.”BBC letter In fullDear Lord Hall,RE: BBC Coverage of BrexitBrexit is the most important political challenge facing our country. Bearing in mind the new Royal Charter’s first ‘Public Purpose’ is to impartial news, as national broadcaster the BBC has a special obligation to ensure that it reflects available evidence and the balance of argument on the subject as fairly as possible.We believe the BBC has fallen far short of this high standard. No doubt the BBC often nurtures first-class journalism but its position depends on trust. If politicians and the public don’t view it as an impartial broker, then the future of the BBC will be in doubt.When Sir David Clementi, the incoming Chairman of the BBC, gave evidence to the Culture, Media, and Sport Select Committee in January, he insisted that the Corporation’s treatment of Brexit after the referendum had walked “a good path down the middle” – despite acknowledging that fewer viewers than ever now trust its coverage. We know many Leave-voting constituents have felt their views have been unfairly represented. This phenomenon is weakening the BBC's bond with the 52 per cent who voted Leave and all who wish to make a success of the decision made.In particular, the Corporation’s focus on ‘regretful’ Leave voters, despite there being no polling shift towards Remain since the referendum, has led some to believe it is putting its preconceptions before the facts. Meanwhile, the posturing and private opinions of EU figures are too often presented as facts, without the vital context that they are talking tough ahead of the exit negotiations.It particularly pains us to see how so much of the economic good news we’ve had since June has been skewed by BBC coverage which seems unable to break out of pre-referendum pessimism and accept new facts. Some of the signatories of this letter shared many of the concerns about the economic impact of Brexit, but all are delighted to find forecasts of immediate economic harm were at best misplaced. So-called ‘despite Brexit’ reporting may be expected of a partisan press, but licence fee-payers have the right to expect better.The BBC has a much larger market share than any newspaper – it runs the most-used news website in the country, on top of its television and radio coverage. This, as well as viewers’ belief in its neutrality, means that BBC bias can have a substantial effect on national debate. BBC coverage also shapes international perceptions of the UK: we fear that, by misrepresenting our country either as xenophobic or regretful of the Leave vote, the BBC will undermine our efforts to carve out a new, global role for this country.We are therefore asking you to take steps to correct these flaws in the BBC’s coverage of our EU exit at the earliest moment.Yours etc.,Julian Knight MPCo-signed byConservative:Nigel Adams MP, Richard Bacon MP, Steve Baker MP, Graham Brady MP, Julian Brazier MP, Henry Bellingham MP, Lady Victoria Borwick MP, Andrew Bridgen MP, Conor Burns MP, David Burrowes MP, Sir William Cash MP, James Cleverly MP, David T C Davies MP, Nadine Dorries MP, Steve Double MP, James Duddridge MP, Richard Drax MP, Iain Duncan Smith MP, Charlie Elphicke MP, Nigel Evans MP, Michael Fabricant MP, Suella Fernandes MP, Mark Francois MP, Marcus Fysh MP, Chris Green MP, Adam Holloway MP, Sir Gerald Howarth MP, Bernard Jenkin MP, Andrea Jenkyns MP, Daniel Kawczynski MP, Pauline Latham MP, Ian Liddell Grainger MP, Sir Edward Leigh MP, Jack Lopresti MP, Jonathan Lord MP, Tim Loughton MP, Craig Mackinlay MP, Kit Malthouse MP, Scott Mann MP, Jason McCartney MP, Karl McCartney MP, Nigel Mills MP, Anne Marie Morris MP, David Nuttall MP, Owen Paterson MP, Chris Philp MP, Will Quince MP, John Redwood MP, Jacob Rees-Mogg MP, Paul Scully MP, Grant Shapps MP, Henry Smith MP, Royston Smith MP, Desmond Swayne MP, Michael Tomlinson MP, Anne-Marie Trevelyan MP, Andrew Turner MP, Martin Vickers MP, Theresa Villiers MP, Will Wragg MP, Lord Hamilton, Lord CallananLabour:Kate Hoey MP, Kelvin Hopkins MP, Graham Stringer MPDUP:Nigel Dodds MP, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP, Gregory Campbell MP, Ian Paisley MP, Gavin Robinson MP, Jim Shannon MP, David Simpson MP, Sammy Wilson MP, Lord Maurice Morrow, Lord Wallace BrowneUKIP:Douglas Carswell MPCC: Sir David Clementi, Incoming Chair, BBC Unitary Board"

And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation.And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit.Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.All the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding -- 250 years since the day we declared our Independence.It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children?I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit -- and so many other places throughout our land.We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross -- and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.And we've spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds --- families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus -- as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first ... because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land.Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop.And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises.Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government. We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential Federal workers.We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials --- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job‑crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines -- thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs -- and I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.With the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation.We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth -- and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. We want all Americans to succeed --- but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism.According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home --- from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe -- and to keep out those who would do us harm.As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS -- a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court -- from my list of 20 judges -- who will defend our Constitution. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined.We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers.Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes -- but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing.I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it's good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me -- without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.They weren't even asking for change. But I am.I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE.The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the ""abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people.""Lincoln was right -- and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others --- have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families --- including immigrant families --- enter the middle class.I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws.If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program --- the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country --- twice. And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States -- financed through both public and private capital --- creating millions of new jobs.This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American, and Hire American.Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare.Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State -- it is unsustainable and collapsing.One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges --- leaving many Americans with no choice at all.Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?We now know that all of those promises have been broken.Obamacare is collapsing --- and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice --- it is a necessity.So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government.Thirdly, we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.Fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance -- and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines --- creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to finally get it done? On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people.My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5.On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old -- and a sophomore at Notre Dame.Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter.But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.In fact, our children will grow up in a Nation of miracles.But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the souls --- of every American child.Education is the civil rights issue of our time.I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work.We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.This is not acceptable in our society.Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.But to create this future, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women of law enforcement.We must build bridges of cooperation and trust --- not drive the wedge of disunity and division.Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters -- and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.And we must support the victims of crime.I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. The office is called VOICE --- Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback. But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands --- Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis --- were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna: I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica: I want you to know --- we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and --- if they must --- to fight and to win.I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.Our veterans have delivered for this Nation --- and now we must deliver for them.The challenges we face as a Nation are great. But our people are even greater.And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William ""Ryan"" Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero --- battling against terrorism and securing our Nation.I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, ""Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies."" Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom --- we will never forget him.To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism.But our partners must meet their financial obligations.And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations.Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people --- and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations.Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light.Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.And streets where mothers are safe from fear -- schools where children learn in peace -- and jobs where Americans prosper and grow -- are not too much to ask.When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans.This is our vision. This is our mission.But we can only get there together.We are one people, with one destiny.We all bleed the same blood.We all salute the same flag.And we are all made by the same God.And when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us.We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears ---inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past ---and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and --Believe in yourselves.Believe in your future.And believe, once more, in America.Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States.We pay for your stories!

My wife is heavily pregnant as well, she doesn't need the stress of it""It's the same for other families as well.

It's something that needs addressing.""WHAT IS THE NATIONAL CHILD MEASUREMENT PROGRAMME? The National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) measures the height and weight of children in reception class (aged four to five years) and year six (aged 10 to 11 years) to assess overweight and obesity levels in children within primary schools. This data can be used at a national level to support local public health initiatives and inform the local planning and delivery of services for children.The NCMP was set up in line with the Government's strategy to tackle obesity and to inform local planning and delivery of services for children, gather population-level data to allow analysis of trends in growth patterns and obesity, increase public and professional understanding of weight issues in children and be a vehicle for engaging with children and families about healthy lifestyles and weight issues.Children's heights and weights are measured and used to calculate a Body Mass Index (BMI) centile.

Pictured, Emma, Sophie and Thomas with new baby Matilda“Doctors didn’t question me. I may have only been 25, but I was in a long term relationship and had three kids.“They warned me it was near impossible to reverse but I didn’t ever want to reverse it.“After I was sterilised, it was like a weight off my mind.“I was glad I did it. In fact, right up until the day I met Paul, I was glad I did it.“Then, when I fell for Paul, I would have done anything to undo the decision.”In the summer of 2012, three years after breaking up with her ex, Leanne started talking to Paul Drummond, 33, on dating app, Plenty of Fish.At first, Leanne was apprehensive about getting involved with him.She wasn’t looking for a meaningless one night stand and as Paul was younger than her, she wasn’t sure they would want the same things.Leanne added: “I had three beautiful children, Emma, now 19, Sophie, now 17 and Thomas, now 15.“Paul didn’t have any kids. I’d presumed if I did fall in love again, it would be with someone who also already had kids.“Because there was no way I’d be able to have any more children.”What is sterilisation? (From NHS Choices)Female sterilisation is effective in 99 per cent of cases.The operation is performed under general anaesthetic and involves cutting, blocking or sealing the fallopian tubes.It is very difficult to reverse and the NHS are reluctant to offer it to any women under the age of 30.There is no guarantee that you will successfully conceive after reversing sterilisation.Leanne was left feeling unsure whether or not Paul wanted kids and worried that if he did, she would be unable to give him any.But, after flirting for a while, Leanne couldn’t stop thinking about Paul and in December 2012 finally plucked up the courage to meet up with him at a local pub.Leanne said: “We talked for hours and it felt so effortless. We agreed to meet again the next night and shared our first kiss.”The pair grew closer and closer and Leanne decided that she needed to ask her new man the question she’d been dreading - did he want kids?She added: “I wanted to be honest from the off because there was no point getting emotionally attached to someone I couldn’t have a future with.“I asked if he hoped to have children of his own one day and his eyes lit up as he said he definitely would.“I had to break it to him that I’d been sterilised. It was too late.”Leanne remembers Paul looked deeply saddened by her confession and she wondered if this would put an end to their short-lived romance.RELATED STORIESGRITTY SCRIPTS Call the Midwife stars open up about their toughest ever storylines in series six 'THEY'RE THE BOMB!'

The state I was in was unreal.""I thought I was going to lose my daughter when I heard that word, methadone.""The worst thing was the doctors saying to me that if I'd have given her those next two spoonfuls it would be completely different.""The only reason I did not give her any more was because she was so sleepy.""It is still in my head about what if we gave her more. We would have lost her.""Ruby-Mai's dad Ralph added: ""What happened was awful. It was not until he came back a second time that we knew.""As soon as I knew what had happened I rushed up the stairs, got her in the car and got her to hospital.""Ruby-Mai, who has since made a full recovery, said the incident had left her scared to take medicine.She added: ""It was really weird. At first I didn't know where I was until I saw that I was on a hospital bed.""I was all dizzy and I felt all funny. Mum said that grandma came on the day but I can't remember anything.""I am scared to take medicine now because I took the wrong medicine and it made me really poorly.""But I am back at school now and I am enjoying it.""SWNS:South West News Service4 The incident has resulted in little Ruby-Mai being scared of taking medicineRuby-Mai's parents are now considering taking legal action against the pharmacy.Matt Goode, a lawyer for ABR Solicitors, said: ""I have never heard of anything like this before.""It is more startling because methadone is used for people with a heroin addiction.""They normally administrate to the patient directly in the pharmacy.""The fact that these parents have been given the whole bottle of methadone is horrendous.""It is just madness. You have given a child a Class A drug.""Manor Pharmacy has now written to the family explaining the mix-up and NHS England has launched a full investigation.The letter states: ""I am contacting you regarding the incident involving the dispensing of Ruby-Mai's prescription in which she was supplied with Methadone 1mg/1ml oral solution rather than the Trimethoprim 50mg/5ml oral solution prescribed by her GP.""I would like to begin by apologising on behalf of the company for the distress and inconvenience this incident has caused Ruby-Mai and yourselves.""Incidents such as these are always taken seriously and investigated in full to try to find out what happened, what we can learn from it and what we can do differently to reduce the likelihood of it happening again.""I felt it was important to contact you at the earliest opportunity to let you know an investigation is underway and that this incident has been reported to all appropriate external agencies who I will update as my investigation continues.""In a statement, Manor Pharmacy added: ""We confirm that an incident occurred at one of our pharmacies, in which a nine year old girl received medication intended for another patient.""We apologise unreservedly to the patient and her family for this error. This is an isolated incident.""Nevertheless, we will learn from it and take steps to minimise the risk of a similar incident happening in the future.SWNS:South West News Service4 Doctors told Donna that her daughter could have died if she had given the nine-year-old a second dose of the drug""An internal investigation is already underway and the outcome will be shared with the family as soon as possible.""Oliver Newbould, locality director for NHS England North Midlands, said: ""NHS England has been made aware of a potential drug dispensing error at the pharmacy.""Such incidents are very rare and a full investigation is underway by the pharmacy.""NHS England will ensure that as a result of this investigation, appropriate actions are taken and any lessons to be learned are shared.""Nottinghamshire Police is also investigating this incident and said officers received a report of a nine-year-old girl being prescribed methadone by mistake instead of antibiotics.A spokeswoman for the force said: ""The girl was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre after ingesting the drug but has since been discharged.""Enquiries are ongoing and Nottinghamshire Police is liaising with other agencies under local authority child protection procedures.""A spokeswoman for Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust added: ""A patient was admitted to the Emergency Department at Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust after being supplied the incorrect medication by a pharmacy in the community.""As part of our internal processes we have reported this incident to NHS England for review.""We pay for your stories!

He genuinely wanted relationships with them.""The irony is, as is often the case in this type of offending, the defendant was keen to impress his partners and would buy them presents with their own money, such was his state of mind at the time.”We pay for your stories!

I was angry and shocked by the diagnosis and constantly asked, ‘Why me?’ But I had to get on with everything for the kids.“My best friend Alison Campbell, who was there when I was diagnosed, was amazing and a real source of support. I don’t know what I would have done without her.""Cancer Research7 Nina, pictured with tattoo artist Shane Sunday, admitted she couldn't imagine ever finding love againThree years later, in order to try to boost her self confidence, Nina came up with the idea of getting a tattoo to mark her scars.She planned it would run from her thigh, across her abdomen, round her back and up to her reconstructed left breast.Nina reasoned: ""Being single, I thought, ‘If I can’t look at my breast, why would anyone else ever want to look at me?'""But when my dad also died of cancer and my godparents were then also diagnosed with terminal cancer shortly after my dad’s death, I thought enough is enough.""I knew I had to celebrate my life and commemorate those who I had lost.""Her idea was to tattoo the parts of her body that she didn’t like to look at, and she came up with a design which featured sunflowers and poppies running up one side from her thigh, over her ribs, up to her reconstructed breast and spilling over onto her back.She explained: ""I thought it might help me like myself a bit more, perhaps start dating and feeling comfortable with someone again.Carrie Davenport7 Nina, pictured outside the tattoo parlour she now co-owns with Shane, told how she thought the inking would give her a confidence boost""People always ask me, ‘Why a tattoo?’ I had been on dates and on dating sites but you have to feel comfortable with someone to show them your body, especially considering how I felt about my own. So the tattoo was empowering for me.""After looking around online, the work of local tattoo artist Shane 42, caught Nina's eye.She visited the married dad-of-two's parlour for a consultation in 2013 and he brought her idea to life.Nina told how she was very nervous, but Shane totally put her at ease.She said: ""I showed him my scars on our first appointment. I almost expect people to gasp, but there was no reaction from him other than immediately starting to think creatively about where this sunflower could go, or where this poppy could be placed.""Cancer Research7 Nina admitted it was an uphill struggle bringing up her three children on her ownDuring their long inking sessions, Nina and Shane got on like a house on fire.She admitted: ""Because of the nature of where the tattoo was, I was always half-naked in his studio, so my self-consciousness was completely taken away.""He has only ever shown complete admiration for my body.""Related Stories'BREASTFEEDING SAVED MY LIFE' Mum discovers 'blocked milk duct' is actually aggressive breast cancer while feeding her baby top check for cancer New breath test could save thousands of lives a year by spotting deadly cancers early ExclusiveCANCER TEEN'S BUILDER MISERY Teen cancer victim living in house with no heating and leaking roof after builders 'drank £11k of parents' money in the pub' CANCER HEROINE DIES Blogger Hannah Lyson, 20, loses cancer battle days after being honoured with Hero of Heroes award ExclusiveJez's jam Two failed marriages, gambling, a cheating wife & now ex is furious over secret affair with nanny... is it time Jeremy Kyle was a guest on his OWN show?

People voted in their millions to leave the European Union and embrace a brighter future for Britain.This is the year we start to make it happen.steve@steveback.com8 PM Theresa May set out her plans for Brexit this weekThat is why, earlier this week, I set out the Government’s 12 negotiating objectives for Brexit, so that everyone has the clarity they need about our direction of travel as we prepare to trigger Article 50 before the end of March.But those 12 objectives are just part of my Plan for Britain. Because last summer’s referendum was not just a vote to leave the European Union. It was a vote to change the way our whole country works.A vote to build a stronger, fairer Britain that works for everyone, not just the privileged few. A Britain – and a Brexit – that works for ordinary working people.Reuters8 The PM wants to make Britain strong for British workersThe plan I have set out this week will build that better Britain.We will make Britain stronger by taking back control of our own laws.So the rules that govern your life will be made in Britain not in Brussels.We will strengthen the precious union between the four nations of our United Kingdom. And we will work to maintain the Common Travel Area with the Republic of Ireland.PA:Press Association8 A post-Brexit Britain will be independent, self governing and globalReuters8 We are leaving the single market and stopping freedom of movementWe will make Britain fairer for ordinary working people by getting control of the numbers coming here from the European Union.We will continue to attract the brightest and best to work or study here and we will always welcome individual migrants as friends.But by leaving the single market and ending freedom of movement, this process will be managed properly.So we will be the ones to decide who gets to come here and when.Getty Images8 We will shape the UK into the country we want it to beWe will make this a Brexit that works for ordinary working people by ensuring that every worker enjoys the rights and protections they deserve.Indeed, under my leadership, not only will the Government protect the rights of workers’. We will build on them. And we will guarantee the rights of EU citizens living here, and the rights of British nationals in other member states, as soon as we can.related storiesFARAGE CASH PROBE EU to investigate Nigel Farage over £450,000 donation from Arron Banks BAD BUS-INESS Poorer Brits 'giving up jobs or college places due to cuts in bus services' CARE CAP CALL Dominic Raab will put £100k lifetime cap on OAP care costs if he becomes PM FINAL STRAW Plastic straws, coffee stirrers and cotton buds will be banned from next April PROBATION FAIL Probation service still fails victims of rape and violence, inspectors find 'TOO LATE' Ofcom slammed for waiting until THIRD death before launching reality show probe ExclusiveSAJ'S MIGRATION BID Sajid Javid to scrap £30,000 minimum salary threshold for EU migrants BORIS BOMBSHELL Boris Johnson is biggest threat to Jeremy Corbyn, Labour voters fear ACID THREAT Nigel Farage should have had ACID thrown on him, Labour supporter says ‘WE’LL SELL MANY MORE HATS’ Trump unveils new ‘Keep America Great’ 2020 slogan at US rally We will also use this moment of national change to build a truly Global Britain, reaching out to old friends and new allies alike.We will build a new trading relationship with our partners in Europe, but we will also be free to do new trade deals with countries from outside the EU too. And we will continue to co-operate with our friends and allies in Europe in critical areas such as science and technology and the fight against crime and terrorism.Taken together, this will amount to a new and equal partnership between an independent, self-governing, Global Britain and our friends and allies in the EU.But this whole approach to Brexit is just one part of my wider plan to shape the country we want to be when we have left the EU.So we will use this moment of change to build a stronger economy and a fairer society that works for ordinary working people by embracing genuine economic and social reform here at home.Our Modern Industrial Strategy, which we will publish next week, will lay the foundations to build a more prosperous and more equal Britain.We will spread wealth and opportunity across every community. And we will help young people to develop the skills they need to do the high-paid, high-skilled jobs of the future.Getty Images8 We will continue to force alliances with other countries and reach out to old alliesWe will create a fairer society by breaking down the barriers of privilege and making Britain a great meritocracy where success is defined by work and talent, not birth or circumstance.This will include going further in reforming our schools and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to thrive in a post-Brexit Britain.And we will build a more united nation by forging a shared society and putting the values of responsibility, fairness and citizenship at the heart of everything we do.PA:Press Association8 Theresa has a bold plan to make our country succeed for everyoneThis is a bold, ambitious plan to deliver the change we need.It is about the ends not the means – delivering the change that people voted for, by making this a country that works for everyone, not just a privileged few.But making this a reality will depend on another essential ingredient of our success as a nation. The strength and support of 65 million people willing us to make it happen.So as Sun readers I urge you to support this plan and to help us bring our country back together.This is a time to stop fighting the battles of the past and look to the future.8 Theresa May delivered a Brexit speech that outlined how we would leave the European UnionIt is a time to be bold, confident and ambitious about seizing the opportunities that Brexit can bring.One of our greatest strengths as a democracy is the respect we show to one another as fellow citizens.This includes the way we respect the results of a vote. Those who win act magnanimously. Those who lose, gracefully respect the outcome. All of us come together.So let us do so. And let us build the brighter future that we all want to see - for ordinary working people in our country today and for every generation to come."

175,What does 2017 have in store for your family and wellbeing? Mystic Meg holds the keys to living a happy life and a healthy New Year,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2520162/2017-family-wellbeing-healthy-lifestyle-mystic-meg/,"2nd January 2017, 9:14 pm","IN today’s final part of her look at what 2017 has in store for you, MYSTIC MEG focuses on family and healthy living.7 Mystic Meg gives her tips for your family and wellbeing in 2017ARIESMarch 21 to April 20FAMILY: Your key  theme is achieving balance,  in responsibility and emotions. But most of all, 2017 asks you to set limits on your time, help, home and understanding. Family bonds that have slipped into silence can shine again. You have a sparkle that helps you bring up difficult subjects and help others to talk about them. Teams that cross generations, old pet photos and a story you’ve been told since childhood can all lead to family-linked luck. A rescheduled event will work so well this time.LIVING WELL: You tend to rush at life, leaving you with a lot of pent-up energy  and prone to headaches. So change pace. Start by setting a fixed bedtime and sticking to it. You hate   routine so mix and match activities,  maybe even choosing  what you do by rolling a dice. Get outside, breathing deeply, feeling the sun. Ring-fencing a few minutes daily “me time” to let your mind wander free can reboot mental energy and help re-frame problems.Getty Images7 Family fun . . . special family luck links to your address when you were bornTAURUSApril 21 to May 21FAMILY: The way to take a family forward is openness – on all sides. There are things you do not share but  in 2017 you can change this and build family bonds on a basis of what is real, rather than what is acceptable, or easy. Jupiter helps you to then stick with changes, and sensing this will help others  relax and rebuild trust. Special family luck links to your address when you were born, old school or college work and a parent’s favourite jewellery.LIVING WELL: Taurus’ love of fine dining can swell your waistline but you can find some  easy answers  by making health substitutions. Incentives help you put in the exercise hours but make them non-food, such as a long bath. Home workout DVDs are perfect for you. Strengthen willpower by choosing a  mantra and repeating it every day. If you need to say “No” to others, then first rehearse with  role-play.Getty Images7 Wheely good . . . embrace your positive energy and go for it in the gymGEMINIMay 22 to June 21FAMILY: Mercury’s 2017 drive to end a time of secrets is especially relevant to your family life.  Keeping  information or advice may feel like power but you must let this go to experience true strength. Best times are from March 13 to June 6. Conversations that usually stay on the surface go deeper, thanks to Mars, for about six weeks in summer. Special luck circles a schooldays souvenir, relatives who share initials, and a valuable find in the garden.LIVING WELL: You  constantly buzz with ideas. In 2017 you  harness this restless energy. Using music to pep up or slow down is part of it, but you can be your own best friend, offering kind emotional support. This enhances willpower so you achieve health goals faster – yes, even giving up that habit you hate! Nuts and seeds make quality Gemini snacks so keep a supply handy. Avoid late-night screens to ensure better rest.CANCERJune 22 to July 22FAMILY: With Jupiter gold in your family zone for most of 2017, start setting ambitious targets. By October you can have achieved them all. If relatives have secretly longed to work or  perform together, this can happen – and it’s also a prime year for expanding families, whether by new births, marriages or bringing generations together. In the summer money, time or love can be much more fairly divided. Sharing vehicles, three-word texts, food-related contests and initial “L” are super-lucky.LIVING WELL: Boosting your metabolism by eating little and often and snacking on fresh fruit and veg can increase energy. Get worrying under control and your tummy can start feeling calmer. Engaging in group activities with a  purpose, like walking for charity or joining in a gardening scheme, motivates you,  but you also benefit from  solo goals. In 2017 you can find balance, plus inner peace. You have Saturn  fit-not-quit willpower until December, so use it.Getty Images7 Stretch it out . . . fusing your physical, emotional and spiritual selves together is such a positive health moveLEOJuly 23 to August 23FAMILY: Dedicate early 2017 to focusing on all the positives in family life, accepting occasional flaws. Utilise Jupiter’s communication gifts. When the golden planet highlights domestic bliss from October, you’ll be first in line. A transformation moon in February nudges you to expand a  family role, while dividing a weighty task between relatives over  summer eases stress. Mercury asks key questions in October, Mars pushes bold promises in December.  Two-part names, a driving job and a wedding souvenir put the  family on the road to riches.LIVING WELL: Resist the temptation of the  latest quick fix diet and concentrate on long-term changes. Get up earlier for yoga or factor in walking all or part of the way to work. Fusing your physical, emotional and spiritual selves together is such a positive health move. Protect your back and consider ways to stand more, sit less. Then you’ll be ready to say yes to some exciting charity challenges in the autumn.Phone Meg’s live psychics on 0905 005 8102 (£1.50 per min + your phone providers access charge. 18+ only) or to pay by credit/debit card call 08000 356 684 or mobile users call 020 7111 6406.Text a psychic.

SP: Inveroak.com, PO BOX 10015, CM1 9HH.VIRGOAugust 24 to September 22FAMILY: All kinds of plans can bear fruit, both in practical and emotional terms. But don’t let focus on tomorrow stop you enjoying today. Celebrate bonds, especially those between generations.  You may think ideas for a family-style business, based on health foods, are  too difficult, but you can make it happen. With  generous Jupiter in your money zone until October, family fortunes  link to handwritten documents, discovering family living in some style in Canada, and a talent for music.LIVING WELL: Tackling tension, in  mind and body, is  key to a  feelgood 2017. Start  with a breakthrough decision around the middle of this month regarding more relaxation, simple treats and  daily  quiet contemplation to counteract  overworking. Mercury sharpens smart thinking, so by Autumn it will be second nature. August and September are super-sexy months of physical intensity when  love is genuine. Say yes to outdoor community classes. Getty Images7 Surprise! . . . keep up with communication as sudden family news will be so excitingLIBRASeptember 23 to October 23FAMILY: Take a key role in family discussions, as Jupiter stays by your side. You have a  lightness of touch that keeps love and respect uppermost and solves even the most stubborn issues. From January to June, keep up with communication as sudden family news will be so exciting. In July and August put competition between relatives to work. By December, when Saturn occupies your domestic chart, you’ll embrace its calming effect! Separate groups which  share equipment, dancing together, answering number questions and a pale blue door are all Libra-lucky.LIVING WELL: Any exercise for  mind and  body is good for you. Pilates is perfect,  but so is freeform dancing in the house with  headphones on. February has a start-again health moon so it’s the perfect time for you to sign up for a  fitness revamp. Early June and late September are spot on for some deep thinking and then making plans that benefit the whole family.RELATED STORIESMYSTIC MEG When do you need to act to make 2017 a good year for your wallet?

You recognise, respect and encourage other people’s talent. By  autumn your family life can  be transformed positively, while Saturn reinforces values. If a family’s divided  it can unite again in 2017 with April and September key. A poem read aloud, a wedding and meeting someone who looks exactly like you add so much luck to your life.LIVING WELL: Aware you’re a binger? Eat little and often instead and carry wholefood bars or bananas for a  snack attack.  From March 1  to May 16, Mercury pops in and out of your wellbeing zone and plans may start tiny but can grow  fast, especially if linked to a big fitness or diet challenge, maybe even a marathon. The strength of eclipse power in your chart means if you put your mind to something  your body will follow. By August 21 you can be on a  new  fitness track. Autumn finds you learning to set limits and from November  energy hits a high.Getty Images7 Ready to workout . . . Saturn acts as your personal trainerSAGITTARIUSNovember 23 to December 21FAMILY: This can be the year you take that step outside a family circle to pursue your personal dreams, and a group gains strength as a result. There is support there, but you need to make the first move. Late February, when Mercury and a powerful moon energise your family zone, is a great time. Summer  promises a mix  of fun times and big decisions, the deepest talking happens outdoors. Saturn instils you with patience, especially in  autumn. Property documents, favourite furniture and a song a family always sing together can link to luck.LIVING WELL: Saturn acts as your personal trainer, plus you sign up for exercise classes. Build in ample variety to diet or exercise to help motivate yourself and be sure to warm up well. In March and April, Mars promotes a way of life that transforms your future so take the plunge. Jupiter shines a light on your most secret self from October 10 so mentally you’re ready for changes and challenges.CAPRICORNDecember 22 to January 20FAMILY: You have  deep inner strength that helps you stop avoiding family challenges or confrontations, and see them through. You, and those close to you, deserve a more open, rewarding life and this is your time to get it. The 12th of any month – and places where special family pictures have  been taken – are  well aspected. Red vehicles, celebrity biographies, unusual pets and flower names also bring your family luck. Through March and April, Mercury helps you  get to the truth.LIVING WELL: Shake off workaholic tendencies by building  downtime into every day. Even just meditating for ten minutes, or listening to one special song while you breathe deeply can refresh mind and body. An April Mars energy boost  can last the year,  channel it into a structured fitness goal – maybe aimed towards an autumn event. Using smaller plates can lead  to weight loss without even realising! Being  surrounded by the right smells is so important.AQUARIUSJanuary 21 to February 18FAMILY: This year’s two most intense moons occur in your chart of closest bonds, in February and August. Hidden dreams, truths and desires can flood out within a family,  leaving the future so fresh. March, April and May focus attention on a shared financial or legal document, and from June to September someone on the outskirts of a family  can be accepted. In December, a last-minute change of date can reunite relatives. TV contests, adding up birthdates, big sisters and “G” names spell luck.LIVING WELL: You should start 2017 by finding and keeping a centre of focus  for you, chosen by you.  Investing in your  wellbeing will stop you getting bored. By  August you should see a  difference,  then the eclipse revs up energy  and you can take changes up a gear. June 21 marks an emotional turning point when you  protect your  mind and heart. A book by a celebrity can give positive pointers. Mint, as a colour, perfume, taste or tea is so uplifting.Getty Images7 Embrace love . . . good family vibes become great by May/JunePISCESFebruary 19 to March 20FAMILY: Good family vibes become great by May/June, when a shared big date is finally fixed, and communication or co-operation is super-strong. You may have had enough of “M” but don’t burn  bridges . . . yet. Offering one last chance, with a summer deadline, can work magic. Mars brings an April surprise, and on November 22 everyone else who matters  can start to see what you see. You have the  emotional confidence to promote and support others. Recreating shared journeys, getting outside together and handmade gifts or food can invigorate family life.LIVING WELL: You are perfectly placed to boost confidence, make major changes and  settle into the best version of yourself. Key is self-belief, you have it, so 2017 will be  Your Year. Food-wise, go for little and often. Plan new health goals around dates that end in “1” and from May to November try getting up earlier to workout body, mind – or both."

starting with a new system of oaths for all public officials as well as new immigrants.The PM should lead a push to define and spread ""a common sense of what it is to be British and what our common values, rights and responsibilities are"".Dame Louise - who also runs the Troubled Families programme – also writes: “It isn’t racist to say that the pace of change from immigration in recent years has been too much for some communities, such as Barking in East London or Boston in Lincolnshire.“People are understandably uncomfortable when the character and make up of a town change out of all recognition in five or 10 years.""What I say in my report today is that, whatever the level of immigration now or in the future, we need to do better at helping people adapt to life in the UK when they arrive and helping all of us who are already here to get to know each other better"".Alamy10 The government has been criticised for not being 'robust' enough for managing the crisisAmong a long series of recommendations that Dame Louise makes to ministers to tackle the integration is also to enforce an “expectation” for everyone living in the UK to speak good English – as The Sun revealed on Friday.Her exhaustive 198 page report – which saw her team interview more than 800 people nationwide – also shines a light on the miserable plight of women in some Asian Muslim communities.Louise Casey: It is not racist to say change is too muchOfficials have ignored women for too long who are forced to suffer “coercive control, violence and criminal acts of abuse, often enacted in the name of cultural or religious values”, she insists.Too many public institutions have “ignored or even condoned regressive, divisive and harmful cultural and religious practices, for fear of being branded racist or Islamophobic”, the Casey Review itself finds.As well as failing the vulnerable victims in the communities, “more often it has played straight into the hands of extremists”, it adds.Times Newspapers Ltd10 Louise Casey calls for the government to instil a far deeper sense of British valuesStark new racial divides are also unearthed.In some areas of Blackburn, Birmingham, Burnley and Bradford, as much as 85% of the population is Muslim.In the 10 years between 2001 and 2011, the number of Muslims in Britain almost doubled, going up by 72% - or 1.2 million – to a total of 2.8 million.And in 2015, a total of 511 schools across 43 different local authority areas nationwide had 50% or more pupils from Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic backgrounds – the two heritages which see the most segregation.Some enclaves are so locked out of mainstream interaction that warped views develop, such as the belief that the UK is an Islamic state and 75% of UK is Muslim.The correct figure is 4.8%.Ghettos are also growing among other ethnic groups, the Casey Review found.More than 6,000 people of Roma or Eastern European descent now live largely in just one single council ward in Sheffield.Related storiesYOU MOZ BE JOKING School music lessons must 'swap Mozart for Stormzy' to improve grades 'WE MADE ONE FOR £1' Poundland trolls BT over its incredibly boring new logo SNAPCHAT KILLERS Teen knife thugs who filmed dying victim, 16, on Snapchat are unmasked BELT TRAGEDY Mum, 58, exempt from wearing seatbelt dies after flying out of car in crash UK FORECAST Sunny spells across UK but light showers in northern areas of England and Wales LONDON FORECAST Dry across London with warm, sunny spells and maximum temperature of 22C DYING WISH Single mum loses fight with cancer after asking family 'Look after my boys' ExclusiveTEACHERS' PET School hires 'therapy dog' to help snowflake teachers unwind during exam time ExclusiveSTANDED GENTRY Mum's one-night stand with aristo led to Lad of the Manor's £50m inheritance ExclusiveLIVE STREAM Apple workers snapped going for cheeky wee behind house during map survey At the same time as damning leaders’ response to the pace of change, Dame Louise insists she isn’t “anti-immigration” and says Britain has benefited hugely from it, as well as the diversity it has brought.She also calls for “more of a spirit of unity, compassion and kindness that brings people together under our common British values of tolerance, democracy, equality and respect.”The report will come as a personal embarrassment to PM Theresa May, who was in charge of immigration policy as Home Secretary for six years.Getty Images10 It was commissioned by David Cameron in July 2015, but delayed for months amid fears it will embarrass ministersBut spreading the blame far and wide, the Casey Review finds: “For generations we have welcomed immigrants to the UK but left them to find their own way in society, while leaving host communities to accommodate them.“As some communities have become more segregated, the increased pace of immigration has added new pressures, leaving long-standing communities struggling to adjust.“Too few leaders in public office have dealt with this key issue, perhaps hoping it might change or worrying about being labelled racist; or indeed fearing that they will lose the support of minority communities.“As a nation we have lost sight of our expectations on integration and lacked confidence in promoting it.”It adds: “We need leaders at all levels – in Government, in public sector and faith institutions, and in communities – to stand up and be more robust”.EPA10 Communities Secretary Sajid Javid referred to the report as 'a valuable contribution'Despite making attempts to solve the problem, the last Labour as well as current Conservative governments allowed action plans “to be diluted and muddled”, the report found.Communities Secretary Sajid Javid last night dubbed Dame Louise’s work “a valuable contribution” and pledged to study her findings closely.Mr Javid – who is of Asian Muslim heritage – added: “Our country has long been home to lots of different cultures and communities, but all of us have to be part of one society – British society.”The Casey Review was also welcomed by senior opposition politicians and charities last night.Getty Images10 Labour's Chuka Umunna said the crisis has been 'swept under the carpet for too long'Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration, said: “The fact people live parallel lives in modern Britain has been swept under the carpet for far too long.“A lack of integration deprives people of jobs and opportunities, increases isolation, ill health and anxiety. Above all, it is sapping our communities of trust.”Jon Yates, director of social integration charity The Challenge, dubbed the report “brave and timely”.He added: “Unless we act urgently our country is in danger of becoming a less integrated and more divided place.""We must not repeat the mistakes of the past by watering down or ignoring its recommendations.10CASEY REVIEW RECOMMENDATIONSDame Louise Casey makes a series of hard hitting recommendations to ministers to tackle the integration crisis and instil more Britishness.The main ones are:* All holders of public office – from MPs to council workers – should be made to swear a new oath to uphold fundamental British values and put their importance on a par with honesty and integrity.These are defined as: democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs.* Everybody living in Britain must be able to speak good English as “a shared language is fundamental to integrated societies”.The government must stump up significantly more cash than the current £20m to fund council classes, as well as lessons in how to tackle cultural barriers.* School curriculums should be rewritten to include more specific teaching of British values, such as tolerance, democracy and free speech.PA:Press Association10 Theresa May was in charge of immigration policy as Home Secretary for six yearsBritish laws and history should also be promoted better in classrooms, and how well schools do that should be part of their performance assessment by Ofsted.* Encourage children from different ethnic and religious to mix better in schools and neighbourhoods.The need for young people to integrate with each other should be engrained in them as soon as possible and not left to later in life.* New immigrants should swear an oath to uphold British values as soon as they arrive in the UK and not wait until they gain British citizenship, up to 10 years later.Has immigration changed your town for the better or worse?10BETTER CALL PAUL with Paul Ross today from 9am on 0344 499 1000 Listen on DAB, via the talkRADIO app or online at talkradio.co.ukThey should also be left in no doubt of what the expectations on them to integrate as early as their visa application to come.* Councils should monitor neighbourhoods closely so any integration concerns are spotted early and acted on.Measurements of tell tale factors should be documented, including hate crime and poor standards in English language.* An action plan should be drawn up by ministers for all councils to improve community cohesion in their areas.It should include how to break down barriers, freeing women from being trapped at home and boosting access to adult learning, for example in IT skills."
179,Laura Trott opens up about married life with fellow Team GB cyclist Jason Kenny and struggling with the weight of public expectation,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2304266/laura-trott-married-life-team-gb-cyclist-jason-kenny-public-expectation/,"4th December 2016, 12:15 am","LAURA Trott grins as she describes 2016: it was the year she won double gold in Rio then capped her year off with marriage to fellow Team GB cyclist Jason Kenny.“I couldn’t get a better year and getting married to Jason was the best day of my life. Better than any Olympic medal. I loved every minute of it,” says Laura of the September wedding she organised single-handedly ahead of Rio.Fabulous10 Laura Trott became Britain's most successful sportswoman ever after winning double gold in RioSuperwoman is a word that springs to mind.“The Olympics can take over your life,” adds the 24 year old.“That’s all you think about for 18 months [so] it gave me another focus. On rest days, I made my own invitations, the place names and the menus. It took forever!”The groom, meanwhile, had just one job – driving his bride from the ceremony at the church to their reception venue, a 17th-century house in Cheshire where 61 guests dined on sausage and mash, Laura and Jason’s favourite dinner.“Jason wanted 10 minutes [for] just us two straight after the wedding,” says Laura.“He told me he wanted to get an old-style car so when [I saw it] I was like: ‘What is that?’ There, at the back of the church was this bright green Lamborghini!”Wedding cars aside, cycling’s golden couple are anything but flash.Instagram10 Laura married fellow Team GB cyclist Jason Kenny in SeptemberThey live in a “shabby chic to the extreme” cottage near Knutsford, Cheshire, where Jason, 28, proposed on Christmas Day 2014 during an episode of EastEnders.“We’re so far away from diamonds and glitter and I couldn’t be any further away from [being] the perfect wife!” Laura says.She has, however, stuck to tradition by taking Jason’s surname.“I’m still getting used to being Mrs Kenny. Some really old man rode up beside me the other day and said: ‘Are you Laura Kenny?’ I was like: ‘Laura who? Oh, that really is me!’” she laughs.Her four-week honeymoon in Europe with Bolton-born Jason and their dogs Pringle (Laura’s favourite crisps) and Sprolo, gave Laura precious time to recover following her double-gold triumph in Rio.With another two golds to her name from London 2012, she is now Britain’s most successful female competitor in any sport.Success, however, brings a heavy weight of public expectation, which Laura struggles with.“Trying to get back into it with the pressures and everything that the Games in London 2012 brought for me – people expecting you to win – was hard. I was only 20. I don’t think I would have quit, but I did stop enjoying it for a time.”She admits that pre-race anxiety is her biggest weakness and she suffers so badly that she “can throw up with nerves”.It’s possibly why, when asked to pinpoint her fondest memory from Rio, Laura focuses on Jason’s glory.Rex Features10 Laura after winning gold in Rio this summer“Seeing Jason cross the line and get his third gold was probably my best moment. I had no control over it, I was like…” Laura stops to inhale deeply.“I can’t believe he’s just won three gold medals.”The couple vowed to “act like team mates” in the velodrome, but immediately after Jason’s third win they shared a tearful trackside embrace. It was reminiscent of the moment they were caught on camera at London 2012 exchanging a kiss behind David Beckham while watching beach volleyball.Her journey from unknown cyclist to sports idol has given Laura responsibility as a role model to young girls, which she takes very seriously.“If a group of girls came here now and said: ‘I want to get out on the bike,’ I’d think: ‘Job done,’” she says.It would be a poignant achievement considering Laura found herself a target for bullies when she first took up cycling aged 10.“Cycling wasn’t cool,” she says.“There wasn’t a Sir Bradley Wiggins or a Victoria Pendleton and the so-called cool kids used to shout at me because I’d be wearing a helmet. Girls drop out of sport because they don’t feel feminine. I can have really long hair and wedge it under my helmet and show them that it can be done.“I haven’t got the biggest boobs in the world and I would rather have the thighs that I’ve got than be unhealthy and really skinny because of it. It’s about acceptance. Embrace what you’ve been given.”National champion at 12, Laura was on the Olympic Development Programme by 15 and competing in her first Commonwealth Games in Delhi three years later alongside her sister Emma, now 26, who also used to cycle professionally.Rex Features10 Laura and Jason cosying up behind David Beckham at London 2012So it was perhaps inevitable that Laura would end up representing Great Britain at London 2012.Success, of course, requires dedication.Laura trains six days a week, riding her bike for up to four hours at a time.Her immediate future is undoubtedly exciting.Laura and Jason have released a book together, The Inside Track, plus there’s a host of endorsement offers on the table.Next month, she will race at the Senior National Madison Championships and then, fitness levels depending, take on next year’s World Championships.Jessica Ennis-Hill has also helped her realise she can juggle her career and be a mum.“Until Jess did what she did, I never thought that having kids and being a sports person was even possible,” says Laura.So how would she feel if she discovered she was pregnant?“I’d be happy because I’ve always wanted kids. I’d just deal with it,” she says.As for Tokyo 2020, Laura hopes to be selected, but knows she can never rest on her laurels.“Just because I’m Olympic champion now doesn’t mean I’m going to be good in four years. Every time I step on that podium I think: ‘How did I get here?’ Because for me it’s not a job, it’s just fun, which makes me so lucky.”Laura Trott and Jason Kenny: The Inside Track is out now (£20, Michael O’Mara).Jade JonesTaekwondo champion, 23Fabulous10 Jade Jones, 23, was just 19 years old when she won gold at London 2012The evening before our shoot, double Olympic gold winner Jade strolled to her corner shop.“The cashier said: ‘You’re that girl who kicks people in the head!’ I’m recognised a lot more since Rio,” says Jade, whose nickname – The Headhunter – was born from the way she targets opponents’ heads rather than their bodies.Jade was 19 when she won at London 2012, and her defence of the 57kg weight class title in Brazil saw her departing with another gold, becoming the first British athlete to win multiple Taekwondo medals.The journey from London to Rio wasn’t easy.Following her first gold she “lost the love” for the sport she discovered as a boisterous eight year old after her grandad enrolled her into the local martial arts club.“The only thing I had worked towards was London 2012, so when it was finished it felt strange, like an empty feeling,” says Jade.When she announced to her mum Jayne at 16 that she wanted to quit sixth form and become a professional fighter, she was given a year to prove herself.Getty Images10 Jade lost her love for Taekwondo after London 2012 but stuck with it and defended her title in BrazilPA10 Jade after winning gold in Rio 2016: She has had to make personal sacrifices to prioritise trainingWithin two months, she was part of the Olympic Academy and the following year qualified for London 2012.She trains four to five hours a day and as for a social life, forget it!“My friends have always been understanding,” she says.“I wouldn’t say [not drinking] was a sacrifice [but] now I’m older I realise I’ve never been on a girlie holiday – I can’t go on benders all the time.”Dating is also difficult.Single for two years, Jade’s training means she has little time to meet anyone.What qualities would the lucky guy need?“They’d have to be fit, healthy and have some sort of goal in their lives. And they need to know that Taekwondo is a priority.”Jade is shortlisted for the BBC Cymru Wales Sports Personality of the Year award.

In Rio, she went down in history as the only British boxer in 92 years to retain an Olympic gold. Openly bisexual, she is proud to be a role model for the LGBT community and is dating a “high-profile US athlete”.A Google search reveals her to be boxer Marlen Esparza, 27.“We’ve been together eight months,” says Nicola, revealing a tattoo on her hand.“It’s the Chinese symbol for love.

180,After tragic loss of 75 passengers on Colombian Flight 2933 I’ll never ignore the safety demo again,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2291688/after-tragic-loss-of-75-passengers-on-colombian-flight-2933-ill-never-ignore-the-safety-demo-again/,"30th November 2016, 2:24 am","THE loss of 75 passengers in the crash of Flight 2933 in Colombia is life-changingly horrific for those with loved ones on board.But for those of us enviably unconnected to it, this latest, catastrophic failing of a mode of transport we all take for granted is, like all plane crashes, disturbingly compelling in its detail.Getty Images11 The 75 passengers on board died in the crashThanks to the proliferation of social media, we see poignant photos of those who ultimately perished smiling on board before take-off, reminding us of the many times we have taken flights with our families and friends.We place ourselves in the minds of those poor, lost souls and hope they knew nothing of their imminent fate, and we marvel at the revelation that a handful of passengers were pulled alive from the wreckage.We ask ourselves: How? Why?Reuters11 Rescue crew work at the wreckage of a plane that crashed into the Colombian jungle with Brazilian soccer team Chapecoense onboardWere they simply the “lucky” ones sitting in an area of less impact, or did they do something that the others didn’t?Time, eyewitness reports and forensic investigation will eventually tell and I sincerely hope the grieving relatives get the answers they so desperately need.In the meantime, this fascination is precisely why so many Hollywood movies have been made about plane crashes and the human behaviour they elicit.Getty Images11 A film is being made about Captain Sully's miraculous landing on the HudsonThe latest is Sully, the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger, who expertly piloted stricken Flight 1549 into New York’s Hudson River at 150mph — thereby saving the lives of all 155 passengers.Starring Tom Hanks, it dramatises the events of January 2009 when, just minutes after take-off from LaGuardia Airport, the plane hit a flock of Canada geese and both engines failed.Dramatic indeed but, unusually, the fact that everyone survived gave a rare insight into what went on inside the plane too.Twitter11 Pilot Miquel Quiroga is pictured with some of the footballers before the plane took offIn the book Miracle On The Hudson, by Bill Prochnau and Laura Parker, it states that out of 155 passengers, only 25 had watched the safety demonstration and just 12 had read the printed instructions.When “Sully” came on the Tannoy to say: “This is your captain, brace for impact,” most did so initially but some decided to lift their heads and peek during the final seconds and this contributed to more than 30 passengers injuring their heads on impact.And bearing in mind that the plane was about to land in a river, only two passengers put on the life jacket beneath their seat. Presumably, the rest were simply in a blind panic.Horrific images of Colombia air crash show the extent of the wreckageWhen told to evacuate the plane via the emergency exits, those in first class were able to do it quickly, but mid-plane a bottleneck formed around the wing doors and at the damaged rear passengers found themselves stuck, with water rising to their chests.Reuters11 Colombian air force helicopter retrieves the bodies of victims from the wreckage of the planeOne stripped to his pants and was agile enough to vault over several rows to reach the first-class exits.

Mastectomy parties are becoming increasingly popular in the UK, while bakeries are taking more requests for boob-shaped cakes.Stewart Williams5 Bye bye boobs party helped Charli on the way to happinessWhen mum-of-two Charli Crowe was told she would have to lose a breast to cancer last December, her instinct was not to run away and hide. Instead, she had a knees-up for her friends and family.Here, Charli, 28, who lives in Norwich with husband Gary, 36, a full-time dad, and their daughters Summer-Rose, four, and three-year-old Lillie-Mae tells her story.She says: ""The music was pumping, glasses were filled with bubbly and all around me my closest friends and family were bopping around the living room surrounded by balloons and streamers. Yet it wasn’t my birthday or an anniversary — this was a party to say goodbye to my left breast. 5I had decided to hold a “mastectomy party” because I am, by nature, a party girl. I love having a good time. I’m always the first one on the dance floor and the last to leave.I don’t want anyone to remember me as “the girl with cancer”. I want them to remember me, if it comes to that, as the fun-loving girl.When I was first told I had cancer in November last year after finding a lump in my left breast, it felt like a death sentence. But my attitude was that I was going to fight it.""I was given the date for my ­surgery — December 18 — and decided I was going to say goodbye to my boob in style. I started posting on Facebook and set up my own page, detailing my fight against the disease.5One lady shared pictures of her mastectomy party and I thought, “That’s it”.""I asked if anyone locally could help, and a lady from the 7 Surrey Street Cafe in ­Norwich, Lyn McAlister, offered to make some special boob-shaped cupcakes. I bought balloons, streamers and a banner. I got a fab new party dress as well, and I was ready to celebrate. Some people might find it very odd to be celebrating losing a breast, but it helped my mental attitude so much.Of course, there have been tears and a lot of stress and heartache along the way, too.My nan died from breast cancer when I was 19, so I knew the gene was in my family.I had been to the doctor’s a year earlier with another lump but that turned out to be a harmless cyst.I breezed in to see the doctor, thinking this would also be harmless.

Fearne Cotton and Tom Fletcher highlight breast cancer symptoms for CoppaFeel Afterwards the doctor sat me down and said: “We’re 90 per cent certain that it is cancer.” My world fell apart. It was two days before my 28th birthday. I thought: “I’m too young. I keep myself fit swimming and doing fitness classes.”So many things run through your head: What about my children? How will my husband cope? Gary looks after the girls full-time, as he has health issues of his own, being diabetic and epileptic.I was in floods of tears. The diagnosis was confirmed and I was told there were five cancer ­“masses” within my left breast and it was grade two cancer, which is quite aggressive. Surgery was arranged for the next month.I could have spent the intervening weeks sitting in a chair feeling sorry for myself. But my instincts were to fight — I started taking lots of pictures detailing my treatment and set up my Charli’s Fight Facebook page.5I started getting lots of emails and messages from other women with cancer, saying how much I was helping them. Their support meant so much to me.We decorated the house with masses of balloons, a banner and streamers, and bought lots of wine. I invited friends and family — my Uncle Rob came all the way from Wales.When he walked in, there were a few tears but the mood of the party was upbeat.We had drinks at my house and danced around the living room for a couple of hours then we went for a meal at TGI Friday’s, kicking off with a round of cocktails on the house.After that we went clubbing and danced until the small hours.I was definitely a little bit tipsy and had a fabulous time with all my friends and family around me. We had said goodbye to my boob in style.The party marked a turning point for me — I was going to face the future with courage, whatever it might hold.We went months without sex and at times we were barely talkingThe surgery went well and I was in hospital for just one night before being told to go home and rest.In January I met with my oncologist, who recommended a course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy — quite aggressive treatments but they wanted to make sure they mopped up any lone cells.I had six sessions of chemo, starting in February — one every three weeks. That was not fun — it was the worst experience of my life.I called a halt between the last of my treatments as I couldn’t face them. I was so ill I had to be helped from the bed to the toilet. All my hair fell out and I felt so sick and weak.It definitely affected my relationship with Gary.5From being a couple with a good sex life, we went months without sex and at times we were barely talking.Cancer puts such a strain on your ­relationship. I wanted to be upbeat and fight it but there are so many worries. It was so stressful.I finished the chemotherapy in July then started radiotherapy, which made me much less ill but burned me all down one side of my body.Gary didn’t want to make love to me because he thought he would hurt me, and if he accidentally caught me turning over in bed it was agony. We are much closer now but it has taken time to adapt.In August I had an MRI scan which showed all the cancer had gone. I’m about to start taking the cancer drug Tamoxifen and I’ll be on that for about ten years.I don’t think cancer can ever be a positive experience but I have learned so much. Throwing a mastectomy party did me the world of good. It signalled that I am still here, still fighting and not prepared to give up on the fun-loving woman I am.""POSITIVE ATTITUDE IS THE KEY TO RECOVERYDANY BELL, is  the treatment and recovery programme lead at Macmillan Cancer Support.She says: “Every woman will experience their cancer diagnosis in a different way and mastectomy parties may not be for everyone.“But throwing a party shows a  strong, positive attitude and here at Macmillan we have done  lots of research into how having a strong mental attitude and the support of friends and family will have a significant impact on recovery rates.“Anxiety and depression can be the worst side effects of cancer, and emotional well-being is so vital to recovery and survival.“Throwing a party to say goodbye to your breast is a very positive way of approaching surgery. We’re also learning that more women find strength  and support online, via Facebook  and Twitter.“We offer an online community and helpline at Macmillan so women do not feel alone.“I never cease to be amazed by the courage women exhibit when they are told they have cancer. Throwing a party  gives you something positive to focus on, and having a few  drinks with  friends will not do you any harm.“We’re obviously not advocating heavy drinking before surgery, but a few social drinks as a means of relaxing can be beneficial, in moderation – and a bit of dancing will do you no harm at all.”"

187,"After the fourth anniversary of April Jones’ abduction and murder, her sister Jazmin opens up about life without her",https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/1971926/after-the-fourth-anniversary-of-april-jones-abduction-and-murder-her-sister-jazmin-opens-up-about-life-without-her/,"16th October 2016, 12:14 am","EVERY morning, for just a few seconds before she opens her eyes, Jazmin Jones forgets her sister April isn’t in the bed opposite any more.“We shared a bedroom for three years and in my mind she’s still there, tucked up with her teddies,” says Jazmin.Fabulous8 There were 11 years between Jazmin and April and she loved being a big sister“The moment I realise her bed is empty, it hurts. I’ve learned to live with the pain, but it doesn’t go away.”On October 1, 2012, five-year-old April was abducted in her hometown of Machynlleth in Powys. Five days later, local man and father of six Mark Bridger, 50, was charged with her murder, despite the fact no body had been found.Forensic evidence, including spots of blood in Bridger’s home and bone fragments in the log burner there were later found to be hers. In 2013 he was convicted of April’s murder, and given a whole life sentence. Aged 16 when her younger sister was killed, Jazmin, who is now a barmaid in her hometown, had to grow up overnight.“I was a normal teenager, hanging out with friends at a youth club after college,” she remembers. “But when Mum phoned sobbing that April was missing, my entire life changed. At first I didn’t understand. Mum just kept saying: ‘She’s gone. Someone’s taken her.’ “I ran home to our house which was filled with police, while Mum was out in her car searching for April. It all hit me then and I felt sick.”Fabulous8 April was five years old when she disappeared and was last seen getting into a carApril had been playing near her home on the Bryn-y-Gog estate just after 7pm when her friend saw her get into a four-wheel-drive vehicle, which then drove away.When April’s mother Coral, now 44, sent 10-year-old Harley to fetch his sister, he found her friend alone next to April’s abandoned bicycle.It was Harley’s screams as he raced home gripping April’s bike that raised the alarm she’d been snatched. Coral made a desperate 999 call to report her daughter’s disappearance, and within minutes an enormous police operation had swung into action, informing the public a child was missing.Officers from Dyfed-Powys Police, along with hundreds of volunteers from the area, began to comb the town. Jazmin joined in the hunt.“I couldn’t sit and wait – I had to try to find her,” she says. “I began knocking on doors and searching alleys. The streets were filled with people shouting April’s name. The night began with me hoping she’d gone to a friend’s, but as dawn broke, I knew she must have been abducted. I was terrified.”With 11 years between her and April, Jazmin adored being a big sister.Fabulous8 Jazmin still wakes up expecting to see her baby sister curled up in bed next to her“When April was born, I vividly remember Mum and Dad bringing her home from hospital and being instantly besotted. I helped feed and change her, and when she was two we began sharing a bedroom. By then I was a teenager, but I didn’t mind taking part in April’s imaginary tea parties or letting her try on my clothes and shoes. “As her big sister, I always wanted to look after her, so when she went missing I felt completely helpless.”The day after April’s disappearance, police arrested Mark Bridger after April’s friend described his car. An alcoholic, he was a former abattoir worker who lived alone in a cottage just a few miles from the Jones’ house. Single after several failed relationships, he was a paedophile with a vast collection of child pornography on his computer.“When the police first told us his name, it rang a bell, but I couldn’t place it,” says Jazmin. “Then, when I saw his face on the news, I froze. “I instantly recognised him from seeing him around town and remembered he’d tried to befriend me on Facebook a year earlier, but I’d rejected him. Now he was accused of being involved in my sister’s disappearance.”Bridger was a trusted figure on the estate and had known April’s dad Paul, 48, from when they both dated local sisters years before.Fabulous8 Mark Bridger, a paedophile who lived alone, was arrested a day after April's disappearanceFor the next two days, Jazmin’s parents made emotional pleas in the media, revealing April suffered from a mild form of cerebral palsy and needed medication. Hundreds of police officers, the coastguard and volunteers scoured farmland, outbuildings and waterways for the five year old.“I couldn’t bear to be at home,” admits Jazmin. “The house was filled with family, friends and police, with the news on in case there were any developments. Mum and Dad’s emotions swung from despair to anger to confusion. “I had to get away, so I’d creep out early in the morning and go to a friend’s house until late at night, hanging out and pretending life was normal for a while. Mum and Dad understood how I felt and allowed me to go, provided I called every few hours to tell them I was safe.“I’d hide my emotions for fear of upsetting my parents, but I just knew April wasn’t coming home. I’d heard about Maddie McCann, Ben Needham and Sarah Payne. There’s been no happy ending for their families – I instinctively felt we were about to join them.”On October 6, 2012, Bridger was charged with murder, child abduction and perverting the course of justice.The Sun8 Jazmin and April's parents, Coral and Paul, made several heartfelt pleas in the mediaHe denied murdering April, but admitted to police he was probably responsible for her death. He claimed he’d hit her with his car, but couldn’t remember what he’d done with her body because he’d been drinking.“Mum, Dad and I sat with a police liaison officer, taking in the news that they firmly believed Bridger had killed April,” recalls Jazmin. “I don’t remember any of us crying because we were just too stunned that this monster had been living among us. The thought that we’d never get her body back to say goodbye was incomprehensible.” Within days of Bridger being charged, Jazmin returned to Coleg Ceredigion Aberystwyth to continue her media studies course. “Some people were surprised, but Mum and Dad understood I needed normality,” she says.“At college I could escape from the chaos for a few hours. Of course, there were pitying stares and people whispering as I walked down the hall. The whole town was traumatised by what had happened, but it was awful to be someone no one would ever want to be – the sister of a murdered little girl.”In 2013, Bridger stood trial at Mold Crown Court and pleaded not guilty to murder.Getty Images8 The cottage where April's DNA was found has since been demolishedAs a result, Coral and Paul endured weeks of horrifying evidence about what police believed had happened to their daughter: that she was sexually assaulted, then killed – possibly by smothering – before being dismembered and her body scattered in the area around Machynlleth. Jazmin only attended court on the final day of Bridger’s trial to hear the verdict. “Mum and Dad spent Monday to Friday in Mold for the trial, while family cared for us at home,” Jazmin remembers. “When they came home at the weekends, they tried very hard to put on a brave face, but I could see the toll the evidence had taken on them. On that last day I wanted to be there to look Bridger in the eye, to scream: ‘Why her? Why April?’ But he showed no emotion or remorse. When I heard the word ‘guilty’, I felt relief but no closure, as we still didn’t have April’s body.”It emerged after his trial that while on remand Bridger had apparently confessed to a prison chaplain that he may have flung April’s dismembered body parts in a river after murdering her. Yet despite officers searching land and water for 28 weeks following her abduction, no part of April’s body, other than the bone fragments in Bridger’s log burner, were ever found. In April 2013, the largest police search in UK history was formally called off.“I’d accepted that we were never going to get April back, but it was so hard giving up the last shreds of hope,” says Jazmin.NI8 Despite instigating the largest police search in UK history, only 17 bone fragments were ever found of April's bodyRELATED STORIES Exclusive'Their deaths weren't in vain' 10 years after five Ipswich prostitutes were brutally murdered, here's the legacy left behind Exclusive'They ruined me' A PTA mum had DRUGS planted in her car as part of a vile plot after a simple playground misunderstanding ExclusiveObsession, conspiracies and murder Woman posed as a CIA agent to trick her PARENTS into killing her Facebook friends Exclusive'When it's quiet, the flashbacks come' Ten years on, Natascha Kampusch discusses the horror of being imprisoned Exclusive'I found his gun at age six thinking it was a toy' Woman on the trauma of discovering her dad was a BANK ROBBER In September 2013, the family were finally able to have a funeral after a 10-minute inquest where the coroner issued the death certificate. “It was almost exactly a year since April had disappeared before we could bury the 17 fragments of bone, which was all we had,” says Jazmin. “Mum, Dad and Harley went in a funeral car to the church, but I decided to walk behind the hearse. I wanted to go on that last journey with my little sister and see the hundreds of people who’d lined the streets, wearing pink ribbons in memory of April. I felt proud she’d united a whole town and touched so many hearts. But there was still no closure, because we hadn’t properly laid her to rest.”Four years on from April’s death, Jazmin has had intensive counselling to help with her grief. “At first I didn’t want any, even when my parents and Harley had it. It wouldn’t bring April back,” she admits. “But three years ago I began drinking heavily several times a week to help wipe out all the emotions I was keeping bottled up. Mum and Dad gently tried to talk to me about my drinking. At first I refused to discuss it, but I eventually agreed to therapy and it really helped. We talked a lot about my anger, my frustration that it was April who was snatched, and how much I missed her.Fabulous8 Jazmin at April's grave: She is determined her sister's death won't be in vain and she, with her family, have launched a petition to introduce April's Law“Earlier this year, I met my boyfriend Scott [28, a cleaner] who’s been a huge support. We all take one day at a time. Christmas, April’s birthday and the anniversary of her disappearance are very hard, but we keep photos of her all over the house. Life has to go on, otherwise the pain would break you.”Jazmin is determined her sister’s death won’t be in vain and last month, along with her family, launched a petition calling for “April’s Law” to be introduced by the government. “Currently, sex offenders can be on the register for as little as five years, depending on their offence and age. Under April’s Law, they’d stay on it for life,” explains Jazmin. “We’re also calling for internet search engines and service providers to be forced to filter out pages containing or promoting child pornography, plus tougher sentences for those caught with indecent images of children – they can be as lenient as a fine or community service.”Jazmin adds: “I have to face a future without April. I’ll never know what sort of woman she’d have grown up into. I’m an adult now, but she’s forever five. I don’t want her to be forgotten, so if other families can be spared this pain, thanks to April’s Law, that will be my legacy for her.”You can support April’s Law by signing the petition here."

Their presence at the last ever party at Space is a testament and acknowledgement to the enduring love that is held across the dance community for the two British DJ legends who started the first Terrace parties at Space all those years ago and embodied the heady 90’s in the same way as the most legendary of hedonistic rock and roll stars.3 Peezee and BlockoMuch of the antics and stories around Brandon and Alex's adventures have gone down in dance music folklore, like the time Alex stole a bus full of commuters from outside Pacha Ibiza and took them on a magical mystery tour to San Antonio or when Blocko rocked up on stage at a memorable Brit Awards in 2000 and Ronnie Wood threw a drink over poor Brandon who had been assured by his pals that he was the winner of the award Ronnie was presenting.A surge of nostalgia in the scene has been evident over recent years as the next generation hear vintage dance music for the first time and a myriad of incredible contemporary DJs mix the old with the new. The resurgence of Clockwork Orange in recent years has been a catalyst for looking back in Ibiza and Brandon and Alex have been at the forefront of that too this summer.We caught up with them both on the phone last week and they shared memories of how it all started on the Terrace at Space, Clockwork Orange and their excitement at playing at Space Ibiza for one last dance this weekend.This is what we could print.So let’s start at the beginning. Tell us about when you met and how the terrace got underway at Space Ibiza all those years ago?Alex: I was already a resident DJ at Amnesia. I’d been to Space a few times and loved it. It was so crazy, it was unbelievable, it was full of the freaks! At that time it was inside only, one building inside with about 5 bars. It was a very different layout to what it is now. I fell in love with it. When I finished work at Amnesia at silly o’clock there was still somewhere for me to go and party. From then on I was always in Space, I loved the place. I got to know everyone in there. The music at that time was quite industrial but it had a mixture of the Balearic flavours. House was just really coming through. Anyway, José who owned Amnesia decided to sell the club and put me in touch with the new owners who are still the current owners. They wanted to go in a different direction which I didn’t think I could be part of. I’d been on the island 3 years and had been really successful over there and other clubs were interested in me, plus I was doing well back home too. I was just stepping onto the international stage too so I really wanted to push forward. José then introduced me to the guys at Space.I’d gone to the island with my friend James Mitchel who was one of the key guys behind the rave scene with the Back To The Future and Sunrise events. He’d fallen out with his bird and I said to him why not come and spend the summer with me in Ibiza? So he was my sidekick when I went to meet the owner of Space, Pepe Roselló at the club. In those days each bar in the club was rented by a private entity. So we went in with the idea of renting one of the bars inside. Anyway, I got on with Pepe like a house on fire and I told him I loved the club, he said he loved my work at Amnesia, what I had done with the music policy and would I be keen to introduce that to his club. I said of course and that I really wanted to push things forward. Remember this is decades before MP3 so you really needed to know your stuff and have the contacts to be able to get the right records that other people just couldn’t get their hands on. My sound was based on the English underground as well as what was coming through commercially. Commercial music at that time was not considered cheesy. I championed both.I became resident DJ at Space along with two Spanish DJs. The club ran from midnight till 10am the next day depending on how full the club was. From midnight it was a bit more of a commercial sound, then at 4am we closed for an hour and then we would open up for the freaks! Sometimes the parties would go on till the next day till we had to close for an hour again. My residency initially was inside the club.So then I said to Pepe would James and I be able to take one of his bars, but he said all the bars inside were gone. So what came next was exactly how the Space Terrace came about. We went and sat outside the offices and sat in an area outside the club which was the Terrace, it was where the staff used to put their coats, there was a bar surface and a coffee machine. James and I were thinking maybe we should look for another bar somewhere else. Then a bunch of amazing looking women paraded by who were going for the PR jobs at the club. I looked at James and said ‘we have got to stay here’! We looked around and I said 'why don’t we do it here!' I thought I could play all the light fluffy stuff outside during the day instead of the heavier vibes inside and that we could make it an alternative to inside the club. James loved the idea and we decided to call it The Terrace Bar. The original name of the bar was the Full Moon Terrace Bar which we shortened. We met with Pepe again later and we asked him if we could set our bar up out there and run something alternative. Pepe laughed and said of course we could. I don’t think he was convinced that it was going to work. I had already been calculating in my head what I was going to do, speaking to all my big DJ mates from around the island and getting them to come down and do an alternative set for me. I wanted it funky and light hearted. I got the likes of Carl Cox, Sasha, Sven Vath, Mark Spoon, Cosmic Baby in to do it. Basically a flavour of the international DJs of the time and a lot of my English friends.We plumbed the bar in out there, painted it white and decorated the Terrace. We did a deal with Pepe saying we could open pre-party so at 10pm and we started pre-parties for people rocking up at Space early. We did this for one season and were initially struggling with it. With my residency it was long, long hours, 7 days a week. I was sleeping at the club between sets, working behind the bar, a proper one man band and it was exhausting. It was full on and a proper learning curve. The second season which was 1992 we got a better sound system on the terrace and it started to gain a reputation and began to grow and grow from there. The inside of the club was doing really well and I was very much part of that but I decided to go in all guns blazing that second season on the terrace. With me inviting all my friends and the DJs I knew to come and play it became a bit of a social but an alternative social that everyone wanted to be a part of.3With the huge amount of work and crazy hours I realised I needed some help with it all, it was getting madder and madder and I thought to myself who is the only other person that could deal with it and there was only one other person, and that was Blocko. I had to call in the cavalry. So I put out a couple of feelers to see where he was and whether he was on the island. As luck would have it he was on the island but I had gone out on a bender and had ended up in Pacha. I was stumbling around outside afterwards off my cake and getting on different motorbikes, none of which were mine. I was getting Italian fellas coming up to me asking me what I was doing as they were their motorbikes. I was saying 'sorry mate, I’m looking for my moped!' So I got a few slaps. Anyway, I thought right, I’ll leave my moped there and I walked to the bus stop which was about 300 metres from Pacha’s main entrance. There are loads of freaks hanging around outside and I was feeling a bit paranoid. Anyway a bus pulled up and the driver has got off the bus to grab a croissant. I looked up and thought to myself, ‘this is my bus’! So I jumped in and drove it from Pacha to San Antonio with a bus full of people who were on their way to work! So after a few bumps and scratches and going over a few mini roundabouts I managed to get there, where to a big sigh of relief to all the passengers, I jumped off. I then bumped into ‘not well Danielle’ who told me Blocko was looking for me and told me where I could find him.So I turned up at Blocko's apartment, slagged him and his mates off, got a load of fruit and veg that they had stocked up on to keep them healthy at the start of their trip from the fridge and started throwing it all round the room, had a punch up with a couple of his mates and then the Guardia Civil turned up, arrested me and took me off. They knocked seven shades of shit out of me and then threw me out without charge!  They thought I was Diablo, the devil! It could have been a lot worse though. Anyway, then I went back to find Blocko and turned up at Cafe Del Mar looking all dishevelled and beat up. So I said to Blocko that I needed him to help me out at Space and he was up for it. I took him down to Space the next day. Once Blocko jumped on board it went through the roof and the madness started. It was proper multicultural and everyone partied hard.Brandon: I originally went to Ibiza in 1990 with Charlie Chester and got absolutely ridiculous out there with a few other pals. I then met Alex later back in the UK at a gig and we kept in touch and became firm friends. He told me what he was up to in Ibiza and to make sure that I came over. So me and my mate Baggy, who was my long time friend in my club FUBAR which I used to run with Lisa Loud at Milk Bar in Leeds, had been to Ibiza before and said we should go and get involved over there. So off we went. We arrived in the May and we stayed in this apartment block in San Antonio.Next door to us was this geezer called Matt and he said that Alex was looking for me and that he had heard I was on the island. Alex was awol after nicking a bus full of normal bods and driving them from Pacha to San Antonio. Next thing he turns up at my door swearing, shouting and screaming. He’d been out all night and he started calling us all the names under the sun. Then he disappeared as he got arrested by the Guardia Civil. Anyway, the next night he comes back battered and bruised to where we were down at Cafe Del Mar having a drink and he says to me to come to Space the next day and bring my records. He said I would love it there. So the next morning I went to Space with my 5 boxes of records and walked in and went oh my God look at this place! When I arrived Alex ushered me over behind the bar and introduced me to Pepe Roselló straight away and we played for the rest of the day, about 8 hours. It was incredible and Alex said to me I was in and that we would do it every week. That same week Space set me up out there and I became part of the woodwork straight away. James Mitchel and Alex were the guys who came up with the idea of putting music out on the Terrace. They didn’t know at that time what it would turn into but what a great vision it turned out to be. I had the good fortune to be able to play every week there for the next 6 years. I then needed to be carried home from Ibiza at the end of the 96 season!Alex: We got got a wheelchair for him one year!Brandon: Lots of promoters saw what me and Alex were doing and obviously wanted a piece of it. The club had started opening every day and all the big DJs of the time would come down and join us there. It was a unique experience back then with the open air Terrace. I think it lost a certain magic when they put the roof on the Terrace but it still remained unique, it was the only after hours club in the world for a long time. Pepe realised a loophole that you only needed to shut the club for an hour before you could reopen. There were a lot of factors which made it absolutely fantastic.3You guys are playing Space Closing. It must feel good to be playing there and to be acknowledged for your huge contribution to what Space became?Brandon: It is an honour to be playing the last ever closing party. I was thinking that they just can’t shut this club forever without us because no matter what anyone else has done over the years, we did the first bit and that’s it, that’s the history.Alex: It came a bit out of the blue. We were pretty upset that we had been left out of the previous stuff and there didn’t appear to be any recognition of our contribution.They had a big celebration for their 25th birthday a couple of years ago and we were left out of that which we didn’t really understand at the time but we never left Space on bad terms. But the response we have had to us playing the closing has been amazing. People that haven’t been to Space since we started it on the Terrace are going to be there.I’ve got to take this opportunity to say thanks to Pepe at Space. I was just a young kid back then and he gave me the opportunity to grow. He gave me the opportunity to help build one of the biggest clubs in the world in those early days. I have so much respect for him and love him. He is an amazing and charming man and the island would not be what it is without him. Unfortunately Space is going to go now and it’s heartbreaking not just from a selfish point of view but also for the younger generation who won’t now see what it was all about. Everyone went to Space back in the day and took something away from it. The influence of that club has been massive.What can we expect from you guys at Space Closing?Brandon: Well I don’t know how long we are going to be allowed to play, there are a lot of DJs playing! So I think our set will most likely be short, sharp and to the point. We will be picking out some choice big Terrace tunes. We want to play stuff that we are remembered for but perhaps we will go slightly leftfield too but generally I’m thinking of pulling out big records that will resonate with everyone.Alex: Just about everyone who over the years has partied with me from around the world has been in touch and said they're gonna be there. It's gonna go off! They know what to expect from Peezee and Blocko and for all the newcomers, hold on to your hats it's gonna be a fast ride!The last couple of years has seen a big resurgence in Clockwork Orange which you guys have been a big part of over the years. How have the recent parties been and how do they compare to the old days?Brandon: I have to give it to the boys. The parties are so well attended in Ibiza and London. Back in the day, it was myself and Clara Da Costa that sat down when she was in taking over the promotions at Es Paradis in '94 and I said you have to get Clockwork out here, they're smashing it in London. Clara had heard the good things coming from London and she got them out there. They had 5,000 people attending every week, it was the place to go. Since Danny and Andy brought it back the last 3 years in Ibiza it has just been getting better and better. People have been embracing these moments of sheer fun. Don’t forget that Clockwork was a very big movement back in the day. Today you have the parents who went to Clockwork back in the day bringing their kids to the parties. It’s lovely to say that after 25 years you can still play the classic music in Ibiza at Clockwork and just have it right off!Alex: It’s a beautiful thing. They went about it in the right way. We have had a resurgence of interest in us as DJs and retro nights have been doing well for a few years now. Danny got a whiff of it and wanted to give it another go and he works so hard directing everything and it’s been a great success again. I love those boys. As Brandon says, it was us that introduced them to Clara Da Costa at Es Paradis for their first Ibiza gig. Danny and Andy reminded me of myself and Blocko. They had the hunger for it and were funny characters. It is a joy to continue to work with them.Can you give us a memory from Space and those heady times that will live with you forever?Brandon: I’ve got some real good ones! Haha! But here’s a clean one. One Sunday, I was pretty well oiled for want of a better term and I was feeling the love of Space so I was throwing all my records out to the crowd for them to keep. As I was playing them I was just throwing them out to the crowd. It got to the end and people were shouting ‘one more, one more’ and I didn’t have any records left as I’d given them all away so I had to ask for some of them back!Alex: It was just non stop 24/7. For me and Brandon it was our destiny. I don’t think many other people could have coped with it and there are so many memories or blurred memories. I remember one time we drove Sasha back from Space and we were all over the shop and by the time we got to where we were going he was in the back with white knuckles and tears in his eyes saying he would never get in a car with us again. And to this day he never has.Alex P and Brandon Block say goodbye to Space Ibiza at the sold out closing fiesta on Sunday October 2nd."

The new figures clearly demonstrate that this influx of new blood has been accompanied by a shift to the left.Tellingly, among those members who did not vote Labour in the 2015 general election, the opposition leader recorded a massive advantage over Smith.It was not clear whether this group was made up predominantly of previous non-voters or of ex-backers of the Greens or smaller left-wing parties.On popular search engine Google today ""How to leave the Labour Party"" was the most searched for party-related term.After sweeping to victory, Jeremy Corbyn called for unity and urged Labour to ""wipe the slate clean"" after crushing Owen Smith to win his second leadership contest in a landslide victory.RELATED STORIES:JAMES FORSYTH Sensible Labour members will be mourning Jeremy Corbyn's leadership win this weekend Video'DEAF TO JEWS' Anti-Semitism campaigners file complaint against Jeremy Corbyn over campaign video VideoJUST SHUT UP JEZZA Tone deaf Jeremy Corbyn embarrasses himself when he joins in with choir serenading him on the street INTERNAL WARFARE David Miliband attacks Corbyn saying Labour hasn’t been further from power since the 1930s LOONY CORBYN LAMPOONED Veteran leftie Jeremy Corbyn wants to hire a Minister for Peace to persuade countries to disarm The party announced at a special conference in Liverpool this morning that the veteran leftie was victorious over the Pontypridd MP by 61.8 per cent to 38.2 per cent.More than 500,000 votes were cast, with Corbyn picking up 313, 209 to his rivals 193,229.Mr Smith had all but conceded defeat earlier today after it was expected the current Labour leader would romp to victory.Speaking after his victory Mr Corbyn urged Labour to ""wipe the slate clean"" after following a bitter campaign kickstarted by a host of his Shadow Cabinet members resigning in late June.He said the both he and Mr Smith were part of the ""same Labour family"" in an appeal for unity, and thanked voters in the contest for their ""trust and support"".Referring to the ""passionate and often partisan"" contest, Corbyn acknowledged ""things are sometimes said in the heat of the debate on all sides which we sometimes later come to regret"".But he added: ""I will do everything I can to repay the trust and support, to bring our party together, to make it an engine of progress for our country and the people that depend on the Labour Party to protect their interests, and win power to deliver real change in this country.""Mr Corbyn continued: ""We have much more in common than that which divides us.""As far as I'm concerned, let's wipe that slate clean from today and get on with the work we have got to do as a party together.""Mr Corbyn called on Labour MPs to unite behind his leadership and help build support for ""a genuine alternative"" to the Conservative Government.PA9 Jeremy Corbyn has romped to victory in the Labour leadership contest over Owen SmithHall not even half filled for the second coming #JeremyCorbyn #LabourLeadership pic.twitter.com/tjVId31VG7— esmewren (@esmewren) September 24, 2016""I have no doubt this party can win the next general election whenever the Prime Minister calls it, and form that next government,"" he said.""To do that, we have all got to work together.""Mr Corbyn said he had a responsibility as leader to unite the party at conference, in Parliament and across the country.But he added: ""It is also the responsibility of the whole party - Members of Parliament, councillors, party members and our wonderful supporters across the country - to work together and respect the democratic choice that's been made.""Getty Images9 He called on his party to unite and ""wipe the slate clean"" after months of infightingAnd he urged all Labour supporters to join him in taking part in a national day of action next Saturday against Mrs May's plans to expand selection in education and open new grammar schools.Following a summer-long campaign dogged by allegations of abuse between supporters on opposing sides of the party, Mr Corbyn delivered a promise to tackle intimidation.He said: “Our party has a duty of care to our members.

members (168,216 to 116,960), registered supporters (84,918 to 36,599) and affiliated supporters (60,075 to 39, 670).Let’s work together for real change - Jeremy CorbynHere is his full speech after winning the Labour leadership:I want to thank the more than 300,000 members and supporters who have given me their support and trust in this Labour leadership election.I am honoured to have won the votes of a majority of members, of affiliated supporters and of registered supporters, who have given me the second mandate in a year to lead our party.I want to thank the volunteers on my campaign, on Owen Smith’s campaign, and to Owen himself and to all the Party staff who worked so hard over the summer.It has been an amazing summer all over Britain our Labour family facing the future.And I will do everything I can to repay that trust and that support to bring our party together to make it an engine of progress for our country and the people that depend on the Labour Party to protect their interests and win power to deliver real change.Elections are passionate and partisan affairs things are often said in the heat of the debate on all sides that we later regret.But always remember in our party, we have much more in common than that which divides us.As far as I’m concerned the slate is wiped clean from today.We are proud as a party that we’re not afraid to discuss openly, to debate and disagree that is essential for a party that wants to change people’s lives for the better that isn’t prepared to accept things as they are.It’s also an essential part of what has drawn over half a million people into membership of what is now the largest political party in western Europe a party which has nearly tripled in size since last spring.Those new members are now part of a nationwide movement who can now take our message into every community in the country to win support for the election of a Labour government.Our party has a duty of care to our members.That means intervening to stop personal abuse and also abiding by the principles of natural justice in the way we handle it.Politics is demeaned and corroded by intimidation and abuse. It is not my way and it is not the Labour way.Now is the time for all of us to focus every ounce of our energy on exposing and defeating the Tories and the damage they are doing to our country.Theresa May’s Government isn’t a new government it’s David Cameron’s government with a new hard right edge, repackaged with progressive slogans but threatening to take the country backwards and dithering as we face the historic challenges of Brexit.So if you believe that education is better than segregation;That we need an NHS that isn’t threatened with breakdown loaded with debt; That older people deserve dignity and the care they need in their own home; That we have a duty as a country to refugees and to promote peace rather than conflict;If like me you believe that it’s a scandal that here in Britain, the sixth largest economy in the world four million children are in poverty and six million workers are paid less than the living wage.And if, like me, you believe we can do things far better then help us build support for a genuine alternative that will invest in our future a more prosperous future in which the wealth we all create is shared more equally.Together, arguing for the real change this country needs I have no doubt that this party can win the next election whenever Theresa May decides to call it and form the next government.To do that, we need to work together.This time next week we will hit the streets united as a party I am calling on Labour party members to join us in a national campaign for inclusive education for all next Saturday.The Tories’ plans for grammar school segregation of our children expose their divisive and damaging agenda for our country.My responsibility as Labour Leader is to unite this party at conference this week in Parliament and in every community around the country.But it’s also the responsibility of the whole party: members of parliament, councillors, members and supporters across the country to work together and respect the democratic choice that’s been made.Labour is a party brimming full of ideas of talent and creativity and so is Britain.Unleashing that potential is the job of all of us.

You can build up your CV in different ways, such as relevant work experience, community work or volunteering.3) The application process: Two thirds of young unemployed Brits say they have never had guidance to fill out a job application.But there are loads of resources online that can help you get this right, from CV templates to advice on how to write a killer covering letter, so look up anything you are not sure about before you send out an application.4) Interviews: It can be easy to veer off topic and miss opportunities to show off your skills when you are under pressure in an interview.One way to stay focused is to read the job description before the interview and go in armed with examples of how you fit the key criteria that the interviewers are looking for.5) Dealing with rejection: You won’t get a job offer from every application you make, so it’s important not to take rejections to heart.The key is to be persistent and give each application your best effort — if you don’t get the job, ask to be kept informed of other opportunities and seek feedback that could help your next application.For more information or help, see princes-trust.org.uk for details of courses running in your area. ' 'I'M EMPLOYED FULL-TIME'AMY RAWBONE feared she would never get a job after crippling anxiety left her afraid to leave the house.The 20-year-old, from Oldland Common in Bristol, became depressed, self-harmed and even had  suicidal thoughts.However, after completing two courses with the Prince’s Trust, she is now in full-time employment with Marks & Spencer.Amy, right, says: “I thought about killing myself.  I saw no way out.“With support from my family, I began attending counselling and was referred to the Prince’s Trust Fairbridge Programme, which helps build young people’s confidence. At first, I found the course really tough. I was shaking on arrival and begged my mum not to leave.“However,  after having  one-to-one sessions, I was able to join group activities.“Within weeks I could manage my anxiety and started socialising again.“Best of all, I shared my story with a 30-strong audience, which was a real turning point.“I applied to Make Your Mark, a four-week employability programme run in partnership between the Prince’s Trust and Marks & Spencer, and I was offered a full-time job.“Now I look forward to every day.” Find crest of BritishIS your child a budding intellect?

I was going to send it to my husband to show what our mischievous little three-year-old was up to.Facebook6 The image of the youngster preparing for a tragedy has been shared more than 3,000 times online""However, the moment she told me what she was doing I broke down.
