But taking us out of the EU while keeping us in a customs union — their cunning plan, God help us — would not be a pragmatic compromise to unite our divided country.PA:Press Association8 Do Theresa May and new best mate Jeremy Corbyn really want to turn this great country into a banana republic with no bananas?Keeping us in a customs union would be a grotesque act of national self-harm. Keeping us in a customs union would render the UK a forelock-tugging colony of the EU for ever. Taking us out of the EU while locking us in a customs union with the EU would be the worst of all possible worlds.It would prevent us from striking our own trade deals around the world — the great shining dream of Brexit — while leaving us beholden to the whims, wishes and interests of the EU. We would be instantly diminished.The country that has not been invaded for 1,000 years would be brought to its knees by mediocre politicians.  Just to be totally clear — taking us out of the EU while keeping us in a customs union would be STARK RAVING MAD.If we remain in a customs union while leaving the EU — a pitiful Brexit in name only, a pathetic excuse for Brexit — then we lose our voice without gaining our freedom. We could have no independent trade policy of our own.Leaving the EU while remaining in a customs union would not be a compromise. It would be national suicideTony ParsonsWith us out yet still shackled, the EU would be run totally for the benefit of others — for the faltering car industry of Germany, for the greedy farmers of France — and there will be bugger all that we can do about it. Apart from suck it up.Just how stupid are Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn? Very, very stupid. Their plan is a policy of abject, unconditional surrender.If we leave the EU but stay in a customs union then the EU will be free to offer the world access to the UK’s 65million consumers without the UK getting ANYTHING in return. The EU would become Britain’s pimp. Three countries in the world have a customs union with the EU without being members of the European Union — Turkey, San Marino and Andorra.Getty Images - Getty8 Giving in to Corbyn and keeping us in a customs union would be a grotesque act of national self-harmWith all due respect to Turkey, San Marino and Andorra — do May and Corbyn really think so little of the UK?We are the fifth largest economy on the planet. We are the oldest parliamentary democracy! We are a military superpower. We deserve infinitely better than the future that Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have planned for us.Whatever way you voted in the EU referendum, and whatever your feelings now, a customs union is not the way forward. A customs union would be ­infinitely worse than either leaving or staying. It would mean our trade policy is determined in Brussels without British interests ever being considered.Personally, I have given up on the lying muppets of Westminster ever delivering Brexit. If it was going to happen, then it would have ­happened by now.'LABOUR AND THE TORIES HAVE TREATED THE PUBLIC LIKE THICK PEASANTS'The British establishment — the House of Commons, House of Lords, big business in the shape of the CBI, a pro-Brussels civil service and our state broadcaster, the BBC — were all against this country leaving the European Union.Together, this powerful alliance has overruled the largest vote for anything in our history.  What that means for our democracy nobody knows.But leaving the EU while remaining in a customs union would not be a compromise. It would be national suicide.We would be infinitely better staying in the European Union. Or truly leaving.We all want to end the Brexit deadlock.But leaving the EU while staying in a customs union is like treating a migraine by putting a bullet in your brain.THE conclusion of the local election results that punished both of the major parties is — a pox on both your houses.Labour and the Tories have treated the public like mugs, thick peasants who should not be allowed anywhere near a polling booth.Now they will reap the whirlwind.Theresa May admits Britain COULD stay in customs union Let's keep sexy KatFOR her snogging crimes on the last series of Strictly, Katya Jones is said to have been demoted to substitute dancer on the next series, deemed too hot to handle some ageing boy band member on the skids, or ambitious TV presenter, or comedian you have never heard of.Getty - Contributor8 It’s a dance show, not Songs Of Praise. And Strictly needs the naughty likes of Katya JonesShame. Katya is a great dancer and choreographer and  the air of sexual abandon around Strictly is one of the things that makes the show a success.True, sleaze will never be good for what is allegedly wholesome prime-time family entertainment.But do we really want to kill all possibility of romance blossoming during all those long, sweaty rehearsals?Don’t you want to believe that some of the passion on the dance floor is not being faked?  Shouldn’t some deep needs and feelings be stirring inside that skin-tight Lycra?It’s a dance show, not Songs Of Praise.

Jack Glenny, 24, finished in just over seven hours.“One of the proudest moments of my life was  tarnished,” says Jack. “We were berated and told, ‘run, fat boy, run.’ It’s disgraceful.”Who were these creeps?

Leyton Orient F.C. are keen to return to the spotlight in FIFA 20These marquee signings were subsequently not available in FIFA, omissions felt by the community. As more stars followed suit, EA had no choice but to include the league.In contrast, the National League may not have huge budgets or players of the same calibre, but it makes up for that in history.Formed in 1979, the league and is home to some of the most famous, and most important, clubs in English football - including our favourites Leyton Orient (who were last in FIFA 17).Plus, as any of the National League’s tens of thousands of fans will tell you, you just can’t buy the magic of a Tuesday night away in drizzly Dover. With the CSL making it in FIFA 19, surely the National League isn't too much to ask for?How good would it be to recreate an upset on the scale of Exeter City getting a draw at the Theatre of Dreams in the FA Cup in 2005, frustrating Alex Ferguson’s star-studded squad?Or imagine reliving the magic of Sutton's Matthew Hanlan knocking the holders, Coventry City, out of the FA Cup in 1989.We can only dream... Imagine rocking this beautiful Leyton Orient F.C kit in FIFA 20These were once-in-a-generation moments that stay in the memory of real football fans forever - real football at arguably its most pure.Obviously, decisions like this come down to numbers - and thankfully, the petition has these on its side.This season, the appetite for National League has been bigger than ever with an average attendance of 46,811 across the league each week. Some games have even been shown on BT Sport. The demand is clearly there. Former FA chairman David Bernstein wants to see these much-beloved teams in FIFA 20It's even got some heavyweight supporters behind it - Bernstein being one of them, as well as Sutton United captain Jamie Collins.""This campaign when successful will make a real commercial difference to the financial challenges facing non-league football – in addition to putting a smile on the faces of some of the most devoted fans in the world,"" said Bernstein.Collins added: “I’d love it if our fans were able to play as me and help me nod in the winner against Man City at Wembley.""The campaign is a great idea, it’s about time real football got in the game.” We need moments like this in FIFA 20We couldn't agree more.You can sign the petition and join this excellent cause by clicking here!"

It destroyed me.”The England and Sunderland winger convinced Stacey, mother of his baby daughter Ayla, he had merely kissed the girl fan, not realising how young she was.But at his trial she learned he was not only fully aware the girl was under age — but had groomed her and engaged in “sexual touching”.Stacey, 29, was so crushed by the transformation of Johnson from dream partner to sexual predator that when she later learned she was pregnant with his second child she felt compelled to have an abortion.She said: “I heard everything that day in court for the first time after being kept in the dark for a year.“I realised who Adam really was — an arrogant man who lied and lied to me. It destroyed me.“He knew her age. He’d sent her hundreds of messages. He’d message her, then me, then someone else. Then there’d be another message from me to him asking when he was coming home. It was horrific.“When his messages were read out I felt sick, I wanted to get up and punch him but I tried not to react because everybody was watching.“He’d humiliated me. We’d never done magazine interviews, never been that kind of couple. But suddenly everyone knew my life.”Stacey refused to speak to Johnson at Bradford crown court or ­during the drive home afterwards.But when they arrived Stacey told him the relationship was over.She revealed: “I said, ‘I’m not standing by you anymore. I’m moving out’. He said, ‘I’m sorry, I’m stupid. I didn’t know what I was doing’. But I couldn’t believe a word he said.”After Johnson’s arrest Stacey discovered she was six weeks pregnant.I knew I couldn’t bring another baby into the world.Stacey FloundersShe said: “We wanted more children. All I’d ever wanted was a normal family, a couple of kids.“But it was all falling apart and the baby would have been due around the time of his court case.“I knew I couldn’t bring another baby into the world, everything was a mess. I never thought I could have an abortion. Neither of us wanted to but we agreed it was for the best.“It was heartbreaking but I felt I had no choice.”Johnson, 31, sentenced in March 2016 to six years jail, is due to be released this month.At trial he admitted kissing and grooming the girl. The jury found him guilty of sexual touching but not guilty of another sexual act.Stacey had met Johnson five years earlier when he was a Manchester City player.She fell for the charming, well-mannered sportsman — who seemed the polar opposite of the stereotypical image of the loutish, over-paid, womanising footballer.But after he moved to Sunderland in 2012 his personality changed. He started going out drinking with team-mates, leaving pregnant Stacey at home. He began coming home late — on one occasion returning with lipstick on his shirt.But although Stacey worried he was cheating she did not suspect the depths to which he had sunk.Then one morning police turned up at their £1.85million mansion, Tollgate Lodge in Co Durham.Stacey, sobbing as she recalled the moment, said: “The officer said he wanted to speak with me. I thought I’d been caught speeding.Dan Charity - The Sun16 Stacey said after Adam moved to Sunderland in 2012 his personality changedDan Charity - The Sun16 Stacey met Johnson when he was a Manchester City player and fell for his charm and good manners PA:Press Association16 Johnson, 31, sentenced in March 2016 to six years jail, is due to be released this monthDan Charity - The Sun16 Stacey said she felt sick when Johnson's messages to the young girl were read out in court“I pulled on a dressing gown and rushed to the door. Then he said he really wanted to speak to Adam.“I’ll never forget seeing Adam at the top of the stairs. He went white with fear. Adam asked, ‘Is it about the girl in the shirt?’ They replied, ‘Why did you say that?’”As £60,000-a-week Johnson was questioned alone, officers searched the home. Stacey said: “Before Adam was taken away he said to me, ‘It was a fan, I’ve only given her a shirt’.“I kept asking, ‘What is he being done for?’ I had no idea.”When the officers left Stacey rushed straight to the home of Johnson’s parents, who were looking after seven-week-old Ayla.At 11pm Johnson returned. The normally unemotional footballer broke down. As he sobbed he admitted a string of infidelities.Stacey said: “He finally admitted at least a dozen women.“He said he didn’t know why he’d done it. Adam told me about the girl. I knew who she was. She would always be in the players’ car park after a game.“She’d always ask for a picture with Adam. She was there so often I noticed when she wasn’t.“She’d even messaged me on Twitter when I posted a picture of Ayla. Adam said, ‘I thought she was 16’. He said he’d given her a signed shirt and they’d had a kiss, nothing more. I believed him. She looked about 21.”In fact Johnson had known her age all along. He first met her when she was 14 outside Sunderland’s training ground.She posed for a photo with him which her parents used on a cake to celebrate her 15th birthday. I just believed what he told me.Stacey FloundersA few days before New Year’s Eve 2014, while Stacey was heavily pregnant with Ayla, the girl sent Johnson a Facebook friend request.He accepted and sent her his mobile number.They then exchanged more than 800 WhatsApp messages. He asked if she was in the last year of school and she admitted she was in Year 10 and too young to go out. They met on January 17, when Ayla was nine days old, behind a Chinese takeaway.The girl got into his £80,000 Ranger Rover Sport.He gave her a signed shirt before dropping her off.Flirty messages continued and when they met again sexual activity took place. Four days later Johnson researched “age of consent” online.After Johnson’s arrest Stacey stood by him. She said: “I didn’t go to the legal meetings with Adam, I just believed what he told me.“He was still playing for Sunderland, mixing with fans after the game. We were still being invited to club events, so it didn’t seem serious. I never heard from Sunderland, not once, but they were supportive to Adam.“He promised he’d stop cheating. We returned to being a family. We shared a bed, our love life returned.”But the horrors revealed as she sat in court made her realise Johnson had shattered her dream of the perfect family life.He was revealed as a sex addict who regularly met women after training sessions.He saw the schoolgirl as “just another opportunity, the court was told. Stacey said: “I only went for one day in court and realised it was so serious.“I rented a house and moved out. The day I left Adam was laid on the sofa. He was depressed. I felt sorry for him — then remembered what he had done.”But days later Johnson’s legal team contacted Stacey asking for her help with his defence.His young victim, giving evidence relating to the sexual activity charge on which Johnson was eventually cleared, described him having shaved his pubic hair.Stacey said: “He’d never done that. It was untrue so I was prepared to stand up in court and say that. A lot of people judged me but we have a daughter and one day I have to explain my actions to her. I told the truth for her.”Stacey said having to give evidence was “horrendous”.MOST READ IN UK NEWSDYING WISH Single mum loses fight with cancer after asking family 'Look after my boys' ExclusiveROO'S FURY Wayne Rooney livid after bro filmed looking pally in pub loo with Tommy Robinson ZAPPED TO DEATH Toddler killed after putting phone charger in mouth while plugged into wall 'RAPE' RAP Oritse Williams' manager admits touching 'zombified' girl as 'star raped her' WarningMOB JUSTICE Furious crowds strip female ‘shoplifters’ naked, batter them and cut their hair COT CLOTS Celebs' pics of babies sleeping in unsafe conditions 'fuelling cot death rise' She added: “It felt like the worst day of my life.

He told her he loved her. He knew he was going to prison. The following morning he said goodbye to Ayla and whispered, ‘I’m sorry’.”Reuters16 After they arrived home from court Stacey told him the relationship was over16 During the trial Johnson was revealed as a sex addict who regularly met women after training sessionsDan Charity - The Sun16 Stacey said having to give evidence in court was 'horrendous'Dan Charity - The Sun16 Stacey said the day she had to give evidence at the trial was the worst of her lifeDan Charity - The Sun16 Later Adam was revealed as a sex addict who regularly met women after training sessionsGetty Images - Getty16 Stacey says Sunderland were supportive to Adam but she didn't hear from them onceA charmer, then cruelBy Jane AtkinsonSTACEY was introduced to then-Manchester City ace Johnson in a pub in 2011.She was a PA for her dad’s firm in Norway and had saved for a three-bed pad in her home town of Hartlepool.At the time she recalls Johnson as “charming, clean-cut and down to earth”.On their first date he drove her in his sports car to a £3.5million home in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, that he and two pals rented off ex-Man United star Cristiano Ronaldo.Stacey said: “It was exciting. We shared a bed but just kissed and cuddled.“I loved we were both from the North East. It became serious quickly. I’m shy but he was confident. He could chat to people. He was interested and interesting.”The pair enjoyed cosy nights in watching X Factor and ordering takeaways, but also liked socialising with other City stars’ families.Stacey said of one jaunt to Tenerife: “I realised there Adam was everything I’d ever wanted. I felt loved, secure and protected.“I could never have imagined he’d do what he did.”He gave her a diamond ring on their first Valentine’s Day. In 2012 he signed for Sunderland and they moved to a mansion near his parents.She said: “One day I came home to a gorgeous mini poodle. We called her Bella.“Adam got me a new car, shoes or bags. I didn’t like him because he was a footballer though. I just properly adored Adam, being at home together doing nothing.”Two months after a miscarriage Stacey fell pregnant with Ayla. She said: “I wanted to get married, but he’d say, ‘Having children is more of a commitment’.”Johnson started favouring nights out with team-mates, and barely contacted her during a two-week break in LA.Stacey added: “Sometimes I’d push Adam after he came in late. He’d laugh and call me a psycho. He was cruel.“If we rowed I’d ask to see his phone and the passcode. He wouldn’t tell me. I had suspicions but no proof. And I didn’t want it. I was pregnant.”She hoped everything would change when Ayla was born in January 2015. Seven weeks later he was arrested.Harrowing visits...and mind gamesADAM Johnson’s former partner has told of her harrowing prison visits as sex offender inmates watched their year-old daughter.Stacey Flounders, 29, also revealed the footballer tried to manipulate her from behind bars — suggesting they marry to keep their family together.Dan Charity - The Sun16 Stacey has revealed how Adam tried to manipulate her from behind bars — suggesting they marry to keep their family togetherShe insists she no longer loves the ex-England ace, but admits she is looking forward to his release for the sake of Ayla, now four.And she told how the tot would cry: “Daddy, why aren’t you coming home?” at the end of visits.Johnson was given a six-year term in 2016. For the next year Stacey regularly took Ayla with her to see him in prison.She said: “I could never have imagined bringing a baby into this world and taking her to see her daddy in jail.“It was a massive decision to make, horrible. But Ayla needed to see him and asked for him. I didn’t want her to forget him.”Johnson first spent time at Leeds jail before he was moved to HMP Moorland near Doncaster — where his ex and daughter visited him.Stacey added: “Ayla was just over a year old and had to go through a metal detector.“I had to hold her while a guard patted her down.“We sat in a room full of sex offenders and I felt paranoid, like they were looking at Ayla.“There was one guard who searched me every time I went to the toilet.Dan Charity - The Sun16 Stacey says she will tell her daughter about her father when she is 13“We would sit across a table, Adam wearing a prison-issue grey tracksuit. He said he was sorry for what he put me through.“He said he didn’t realise what he had until he’d lost it.”Stacey added of her jail chats: “We discussed what we’d tell Ayla when she’s old enough.“We don’t want her to read it — we have to tell her. It will probably be when she’s about 13. But she’s clever so it may be sooner.“We will tell her everything. She will have to make up her own mind about what her daddy is, what he’s branded as.“To be honest I don’t see Adam as a paedophile.“For me a paedophile is someone who abuses tiny children.“I think he was a sex addict, he told me he was.”Fragile Stacey says Johnson, 31, tried mind games. She revealed: “He’d say, ‘We can get married if you stick by me, we can have the family you always wanted’.“At the time I wasn’t sure how I felt. Now I know what manipulation is. He wrote saying he loved me, how stupid he was. I felt sorry for him. He wasn’t seeing Ayla’s first crawl or walk.“I told her, ‘Daddy is at work’. As she got older she would ask why he wasn’t coming home like other daddies do. As we left she cried, ‘Daddy why aren’t you coming home?’ He’d say, ‘I’ll be back soon sweetheart’.“I would say, ‘Wasn’t it nice to see Daddy’. When she was tucked up in bed I would cry.”A year after Johnson’s conviction Stacey started dating Sheffield United footballer Gary Madine, 28, once jailed for violence. Torn by emotionsBy Jane AtkinsonIT is clear Stacey utterly adored Adam Johnson, the first man she truly loved.She allowed, and wanted, him to control their relationship in his confident and protective manner.So when shy Stacey was cheated on, lied to and made to look a fool, her confidence was shattered so much that she’s never truly put the pieces back together.She clenches her fists to stop her hands shaking as she talks; and when she discusses his crimes, tears roll down her face.She constantly feels torn. She knows he did something terrible but doesn’t want to abuse him because he will always be Daddy to the little girl who’s stopped her falling apart.And I think the biggest issue is that there’s a tiny part of her that cannot stop caring about him.She hates herself for feeling any love for him.I hope one day she finds the strength to realise the player was cruel and manipulative to his young victim, and to her.She said: “We are still friends, it was a serious relationship, but Adam didn’t like it. He said, ‘What the f**k are you doing?’“I went off the rails after Adam went to prison.“I moved back into Tollgate Lodge (their £1.85million mansion) and was drinking to excess, numbing the pain and embarrassment.“Ayla would go to her grandparents on a Friday.“I couldn’t wait. I’d drink until the Sunday, sometimes getting paralytic on shots, wine, gin, vodka, prosecco.“The following morning I’d be feeling depressed and anxious. But I couldn’t wait until I could do it all again.“I was working for an electrical company and claiming working tax credits because the pay was low.“Twitter users were abusing me. Some accused me of being as bad as Adam because of a picture of me kissing Ayla on the lips.“Some said I didn’t deserve a daughter. I was scared Ayla would be taken off me, that I’d lose the best thing that happened to me.”Stacey moved into a five-bed house that Johnson had bought for Ayla and started her own events company planning weddings, baby showers and parties.She stopped going to prison and instead Johnson’s parents Sonia and Dave took Ayla for visits.Stacey said: “Although we don’t agree on everything, Adam’s mam has been a great support to Ayla.“I’m so glad she’s been a constant part of her life and I’m grateful for the normality that she has helped me keep in Ayla’s life.“Adam was given a longer sentence than we expected.I know Adam adores Ayla and will come out and be a good dad.Stacey Flounders“We were shocked. He deserved prison for what he pleaded guilty to. But it was too long, too extreme. He was made an example of.”Stacey added: “I know Adam adores Ayla and will come out and be a good dad.“Watching them together when she was a baby was wonderful.“He deserved to go to prison. He needed to change.“I hope for Ayla’s sake he’s no longer an arrogant cheat.“I’m still heartbroken about the loss of my family but for Ayla’s happiness I am looking forward to him being out.""She doesn’t deserve to be punished for what he did. I want an amicable relationship with him so that we can both parent Ayla in the best way possible.“I feel like the man I adored and wanted to marry has been dead for three years.“Now he’s come back alive, but I’m no longer in love with him.“I’m not worried he’ll pressurise me to get back with him, I’m stronger now.“You can forgive but I will never forget. I would struggle to trust any man now.“I don’t hate him and I don’t want to call him a monster because my little girl will read this about her daddy one day.“If I didn’t have Ayla I would regret ever setting eyes on him. Poor little thing never asked for any of this did she?“She’s been my medication. She makes me get up in the morning and puts a smile on my face.“He’s ruined my life. I’ve changed as a person. I have anxiety and depression, I’m still nervous about going out.“But it is Ayla I worry about, she is the one who might have to cope with bullying and cruel remarks, I really hope she doesn’t. I feel sad for her too, losing the life she should have had with holidays and two parents together.“He pays her maintenance and he’s good with money and has probably saved.“But I don’t know if he will ever get another job. I don’t know what he’ll do. He’s served his time for what he pleaded guilty to and I’ve moved on.“I don’t worry about him anymore. It’s taken a long time but I finally feel I have closure.”Getty - Contributor16 Johnson won 12 England caps while at Middlesbrough, Manchester City and SunderlandForeign career is only optionEXPERTS believe Johnson will never play in the UK again — but may try to resurrect his career in ­Turkey, China or the Middle East.The winger won 12 England caps while at Middlesbrough, Manchester City and Sunderland.After the trial, Gordon Taylor of the Professional Footballers’ Association, blasted Johnson for damaging the sport’s reputation and said his chances of playing again were “very remote”.The Sun revealed last year a video of Johnson telling his fellow lags: “I’ve got more chance abroad, you can’t get a second chance in England.”Jonathan Rose, the judge presiding over his case, claimed Johnson’s “calculated, considered and carefully orchestrated” abuse of his celebrity status left the girl with severe psychological harm.Clive Efford, former shadow minister for sport, last week said if a footballer was on the sex offenders register, as Johnson is for life, they shouldn’t be allowed to play.Ex-Sunderland star Micky Gray, 44, told talkSPORT it would be “very difficult” for Johnson to ­finish his career in England.He added: “Look, he’s served his time. He’s got to try and get himself as active as he can.“But to walk into a dressing room, certainly if it was Sunderland, would be extremely difficult.”Johnson’s ex Stacey told us: “If he has to go abroad I will find a way to make sure Ayla gets to see him. I want her to have both parents in her life.”GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250 or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun.co.uk"

Back then he was more than £370million in debt.But in the past ten years, according to US magazine Forbes, his hits have earned his estate £1.6billion.That estate is overseen by co-executors John Branca and John McClain, who control the allowances of Jackson’s kids, Prince Michael 1, 21, Paris, 20, and Prince Michael II, 16, known as Blanket. They reportedly each get £7million a year.The co-executors also control Jackson’s mother Katherine’s quarter share in the estate.Getty - Pool11 Jackson died £370million in debt, but since then his estate has earned a reported £1.6billion - but that could all endAFP - Getty11 The cash could stop rolling in for Jackson’s mother Katherine who has a quarter share in the estateThe Jackson family have strongly denied all claims of sex abuse by Michael.But questions are now being asked as to whether his posthumous business interests can withstand this latest devastating attack.As radio stations shun Jackson and ex-fans turn against him, we look at what his estate could lose if the King of Pop is also “cancelled”.11 The Jackson family - nephew Taj, and brothers Marlon, Jackie and Tito of the Jackson 5RECORD COMPANY - POTENTIAL LOSS: £190m (to Sony)SONY Music Entertainment signed  a £190million deal last year for the rights to distribute  Jackson’s recordings for seven more years.It paid upfront, so provided no  lawsuits follow, it would seem the ­Jackson estate won’t lose any money – but they might in the long run.11 Sony Music Entertainment could face increasing ­pressure to drop Jackson – just like it did with R&B star R Kelly, above, after the recent sex abuse allegationsThe losses could be so heavy the label will rethink signing another lucrative contract when the current deal expires.It was a risky move at the time, given that the ­Leaving Neverland film was looming.Music  execs warned the controversy could affect sales and ­commercial uses of Jackson’s music, and so far Sony has declined to ­comment over its biggest signing.But it could face increasing ­pressure to drop him – just like it did with R&B star R Kelly, above,  after the recent sex abuse allegations.SAMPLES AND COVERS - POTENTIAL LOSS: £20mIT would take a brave chart star to release a Jackson collaboration now.Canadian singer Drake paid hundreds of thousands of pounds  to sample Jackson’s vocals on his 2018 track Don’t Matter To Me.11 Aussie singer Sia, was the first big-name artist to publicly condemn Jackson, tweeting her support for accusers Wade Robson and James SafechuckStars were previously queueing up to release some of the late singer’s unreleased material which the Jackson estate lapped up, as they  took a significant slice of the royalties.Aussie singer Sia, above, has become  the first big-name artist to publicly condemn Jackson, tweeting her support for his Leaving Neverland accusers Wade Robson and James Safechuck on Wednesday, the  day of the first UK screening of  the docufilm – despite her  own manager David Russell being  a staunch defender  of Jackson.11 Sia's tweet supporting Wade and JamesShe tweeted: “Dear Wade and James – I believe you  and I love you.”Even one of his  biggest fans, Lady Gaga, would think twice about releasing a Jackson track.AIRPLAY/STREAMING -

POTENTIAL LOSS: £75mTHE Jacko-themed Cirque Du Soleil show is a huge cash cow, making up to £180,000 a time for the estate.The Canadian entertainment firm paid millions for the rights  to produce the stage extravaganza, which went  a long way towards  wiping out the debt incurred before his death.11 The Jacko-themed Cirque Du Soleil show is a huge cash cow, making up to £180,000 a time for the estateCalled Michael Jackson: One, the show is a constant sell-out in  Las Vegas – and a downturn in ticket  sales would have a big effect.  But so far the opposite seems to be the case.According to ticket reseller Vivid Seats, online searches for the shows increased 60 per cent  on  the day the first part of the docu aired compared  with  a week earlier.A Jackson art exhibition run by  the National Portrait Gallery is another high earner that could be hit.  More than 250,000 visiters pay £18 a ticket to see  the themed galleries in London and Paris.MOST READ IN CELEBRITYTHE STAGE IS SET Spice Girls send fans wild with first look at 90s-style reunion tour stage BLACK MOURNING Alabama 3 singer Jake Black who wrote The Sopranos theme song dies SCREEN TIME As Game of Thrones ends, here's how long it takes to watch TV classic series DRESSED TO KILL Killing Eve's Jodie Comer spotted in killer outfit on set of her new movie DO YA THINK I'M SEX-SEA Rod Stewart and Penny Lancaster grab some rock & stroll in Southend MEG'S BATTLE Megan Barton-Hanson had surgery to avoid 'pain' of looking in the mirror MERCHANDISE & BRANDING -

Of the 190 or so states in the world, the top 30 are not in danger but they others should be concerned.”McFate imagines a future when wars will be fought by private armies battling on behalf of the super-rich.“Say one oligarch would fight an oil company and they hire mercenaries and states would be by-standers in that war,” he said.Wagner is reportedly linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a former hotdog salesman known as ""chef"" for providing catering to the Kremlin.The company deployed 2,500 troops in Syria and according to the BBC, led the way in the battle for Palmyra.They are one of the biggest security threats of the 21st centurySean McFate The company deployed tanks and other armoured vehicles, and observers say it was an army in all but name.It has also reportedly been operating in Africa, spearheading the Kremlin’s drive for influence on the continent.In their latest deployment, they reportedly flew in two chartered aircraft to Havana, Cuba, from where they transferred onto regular commercial flights to Venezuela.The contractors’ task in Venezuela was to protect Maduro from any attempt by opposition sympathisers in his own security forces to detain him, said Cossack leader Shabayev.It has been claimed the contractors first arrived in advance of the May 2018 presidential election.“Our people are there directly for his protection,” he said.Wagner has joined the ranks of an industry whose growth was initially fuelled by the US war on terror after 9/11 and includes many British companies as well.They are all made up of what’s been called a “revolving door” of highly trained and experienced ex-military personnel attracted by the rewards of up to £20,000 a month.Their activities range from protecting oil workers in danger zones to being used by governments to carry out risky military missions.Africa has proven to be rich pickings for the industry, and the Nigerian government hired a private military contractor, complete with Russian-built attack helicopters, in its fight against Boko Haram.CAN TOPPLE COUNTRIESP.W Singer, the author of ‘Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry’ told The Sun Online: “You’ve definitively seen companies offer capabilities that many countries can only dream of.""He said private companies have moved from providing hardware to a wide range of services.“The direct engagement with the enemy - dudes with guns - to training advisory, command, control and back end logistics, transportation, you name it.”For governments, the death of a private military contractor abroad doesn’t have the same impact as a member of the armed forces arriving home in a flag draped coffin.Private military contractors also boast they can save governments the expense of long wars.Last year, Erik Prince, the former US Navy SEAL who founded Blackwater, offered to take over the running of the war in Afghanistan.The now dissolved company was probably the first private military contractor to hit the headlines when in 2007, four of its employees shot dead 17 Iraqi civilians.For the knock-down price of $5 billion, Erik Prince’s force of 6000 mercenaries backed up with a private air force to carry them around and provide logistics, would help bolster the Afghan army.The idea has been given the cold shoulder in Washington but the scale of his proposal would make it equivalent to the German deployment in Afghanistan.Getty - Contributor7 Erik Prince has offered to send a private army to Afghanistan to fight the war for AmericaCYBERWARFARESinger said “digital Blackwaters” that now provide cyberwarfare capability have begun to spring up.He said: “In some circumstances a private contractor could enhance the power of a state, in other situations it could undermine a state or be rival.“It depends on what the market place allows and right now it’s a fairly unregulated market place.”But he also points to the experience of Wagner in Syria when it came into contact with American forces as an example of the limitation of private armies when confronted with a military power such as the United States.Around 300 of its personnel died after the US forces guarding an oil installation summoned air huge air support.CHINESE GROWING FASTLater to the game but no less enthusiastic are Chinese private military contractors.Millions of the country’s citizens are working in areas where Chinese companies are operating that put them at risk.These include Shandong Huawei Security Group, the first Chinese security firm to open an overseas office, and DeWe Security Service, a firm operating in 37 countries.With the Chinese government unwilling to commit its own forces to protect its citizens, it has been left to these companies to fulfil that role.According to a Financial Times report, there are 3,200 Chinese private security personnel abroad, compared to its 2,600 UN peacekeeping soldiers.You’ve definitively seen companies offer capabilities that many countries can only dream ofP.W SingerDeWe secured the rescue of 330 oil workers trapped in the South Sudanese capital Juba in 2017.Prince himself has now entered the Chinese market with his Frontier Services Group controversially signing a deal to build a training base in China’s far western region of Xinjiang.The area is part of China’s Belt and Road infrastructure network but has seen a security clampdown on members of the Muslim ethnic Uighur minority.YouTube7 Private military contractors fighting pirates off SomaliaBRITAIN MAJOR PLAYERAccording to a report from the charity War on Want the UK is “an important hub” for the private military contractor industry.It says that at “the height of the occupation, around 60 British companies operated in Iraq”.There are now “hundreds” of UK companies working around the world and at the end of last year the Taliban carried out an attack on the base of the British security firm G4S in Kabul.It currently has around 1,200 employees working in Afghanistan.Many other companies employ ex-Royal Marines to provide security to shipping against the threat of pirates in the Horn of Africa.The work of UK companies is, however, more on the scale of providing security rather than large military operations.For many the rise of these companies represents a worrying development – private companies with the lethal killing power of a state but operating outside the laws of war, such as the Geneva Convention.A report by the University of Pennsylvania law school said the “existing law is vague, conflicting, and incomplete”.MOST READ IN NEWS DYING WISH Single mum loses fight with cancer after asking family 'Look after my boys' ExclusiveROO'S FURY Wayne Rooney livid after bro filmed looking pally in pub loo with Tommy Robinson ZAPPED TO DEATH Toddler killed after putting phone charger in mouth while plugged into wall 'RAPE' RAP Oritse Williams' manager admits touching 'zombified' girl as 'star raped her' WarningMOB JUSTICE Furious crowds strip female ‘shoplifters’ naked, batter them and cut their hair COT CLOTS Celebs' pics of babies sleeping in unsafe conditions 'fuelling cot death rise' “With the increasing privatization of war, it is necessary to clarify what legal regimes apply and the important legal obligations under the law, specifically international law,” wrote author Natasha Arnpriester.""Without proper regulation, private military contractors can “continue to operate with impunity and without accountability to the detriment of human rights and justice.”Sean McFate says: “Basically we're stuck with them.

Contributor5 Giving Valentine's Day card to your loved one is a custom of the dayWho was St Valentine?Valentine’s Day is named after Saint Valentine – and there were actually three Saint Valentines.All three men lived during the 3rd Century AD, but in two different countries.Saint Valentine of Rome and Saint Valentine of Terni both lived in Italy, while the third lived in a Roman province in North Africa.On February 14 each year, we celebrate the life of Saint Valentine of Rome, who was incredibly unlucky and ended up being beheaded.The church itself has some doubts about what specifically happened during Saint Valentine’s life.In 496 AD, Pope Gelasius I described St. Valentine as a martyr like those ""whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts are known only to God.""Pope Gelasius I understood how little was known about the saint when establishing February 14th as the day to celebrate Valentine’s life.He explained that St. Valentine of Rome was supposedly a temple priest who was executed near Rome by the anti-Christian Emperor Claudius II.His crime was helping Roman soldiers to marry when they were forbidden to by the Christian faith at the time.It is widely believed that he is buried in a cemetery just outside in the north of Rome.Alamy5 There were three Saint Valentines that all lived during the 3rd Century AD but it's the one from Rome we associate with the day of loveHow did St Valentine become associated with lovers?When Pope Gelasius I dedicated February 14 to the saint, he chose that date to replace the traditional Roman feast Lupercalia, a pagan festival popular at the time.Lupercalia was a fertility festival in honour of the god Faunus (Lupercus), the protector of sheep and goats from wolf attacks, as well as Lupa - the she-wolf who nurtured the orphans Romulus and Remus, associated with the founding of Rome by legend.The pagan fertility celebration was marked by all manner of rituals including a foot race among naked men, as they wore the skins of sacrificed goats.Apparently, they would whip women staged along the race course as they ran.Another ritual required a child to pair couples at random who would have to live together and be intimate for an entire next year in order to fulfil the fertility rite of the festival.The church was eager to replace such practices with its own focus and thus St Valentine became the saint of lovers.Getty - Contributor5 On February 14 each year, we celebrate the life of Saint Valentine of RomeHow did the holiday arrive in England?Valentine’s Day was brought to England and France by Benedictine monks and the practice started to acquire more modern characteristics during the Middle Ages.The poet Geoffrey Chaucer, is widely credited with spreading the notion of courtly romance through his writings, some dedicated to St. Valentine.Writing 'valentines' to your beloved is most likely also linked to that same time period, with the oldest love note dating to the 15th century.It was allegedly written by Charles d' Orléans, who was being held in the Tower of London following his defeat at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415.In the love letter, Charles wrote to his wife the words that translated to: “I am already sick of love, my very gentle Valentine”.William Shakespeare also took part in popularising the link between Valentine's Day and love.He wrote about St Valentine's Day in a romantic context as part of his play A Midsummer Night's Dream.Getty - Contributor5 February 14 is also known as the Feast of Saint ValentineHow is the day known around the world?Valentine’s Day is a popular day worldwide – here’s how it is celebrated and observed globally.Latin AmericaIn most Latin American countries like Costa Rica, Mexico and Puerto Rico, St Valentine's Day is known as Día de los Enamorados (day of lovers) or as Día del Amor y la Amistad (Day of Love and Friendship).In Guatemala it is known as the ""Día del Cariño"" (Affection Day).In the Dominican Republic and El Salvador there is a tradition called Amigo secreto (""Secret friend""), similar to the Christmas tradition of Secret Santa.In Brazil, the Dia dos Namorados (""Lovers' Day"") is celebrated on June 12, as that is the day before Saint Anthony's day – the Brazilian Saint of MarriageColombia celebrates Día del amor y la amistad on the third Saturday in September insteadAsiaIn Chinese, Valentine's Day is called lovers' festival and is celebrated on the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar. It commemorates a day on which a legendary cowherder and weaving maid are allowed to be together.Valentine's Day celebrations did not catch on in India until around 1992, despite being the nation of the Kamasutra.In Japan, Morozoff Ltd. introduced the holiday for the first time in 1936, when it ran an ad aimed at foreigners. In 1953, it began promoting the giving of heart-shaped chocolates; other Japanese confectionery companies followed suit thereafter. In 1958, the Isetan department store ran a ""Valentine sale"" and further campaigns during the 1960s popularized the custom.In Saudi Arabia, in 2002 and 2008, religious police banned the sale of all Valentine's Day items, telling shop workers to remove any red items, because the day is considered a Christian holiday. This ban has created a black market for roses and wrapping paper.MORE VALENTINE'S DAY NEWSSEEING RED I don't believe in Valentine's Day and every year my wife starts an argument LOVE LINES I got my best friend a rose on Valentine’s Day and she said I crossed the line RevealedOUT OF LOVE We reveal least romantic UK cities as Brits opt to stay in on Valentine's Day LOVE FOOL Mystery romantic begs 'Kathryn' to forgive them with huge Valentine's Day signs INTERNATIONAL LOVE How to say Happy Valentine's Day in 14 different languages HAPPY V DAY Vicky Pattison strips & Chloe Ferry gets roses in loo in stars' Valentine posts EuropeIn the UK, just under half of the population spend money on their Valentines and around £1.3 billion is spent yearly on cards, flowers, chocolates, and other gifts, with an estimated 25 million cards being sent.In Wales, some people celebrate Dydd Santes Dwynwen (St Dwynwen's Day) on January 25 instead of (or as well as) Valentine's Day. The day commemorates St Dwynwen, the Welsh patron saint of love.On Saint Valentine's Day in Ireland, many individuals who seek true love make a Christian pilgrimage to the Shrine of St. Valentine in Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, which is said to house relics of Saint Valentine of RomeIn France, a traditionally Catholic country, Valentine's Day is known simply as ""Saint Valentin"", and is celebrated in much the same way as other western countries.Valentine's Day in Greek tradition was not associated with romantic love.

It boasts a 48MP beast that takes stunning photos, and the AI features are pretty neat.That said, I'm not sure how much someone is likely to use the camera's fun AI scanner to check the calories of their food or the details of a painting they're ogling (a quick Google search seems to work fine for most).I like that Honor has stuck with a headphone jack, and loaded the gadget with up to 256GB of storage, meaning you can take thousands of photos before running out of memory.It's definitely the best phone Honor have made, and cements their position as an up-and-coming player in the ever competitive smartphone market.And for the £499 pricetag - half the cost of an iPhone XS (£999) - it's a great gagdet for anyone working on a budget.That means the selfie camera is almost swallowed by the display, giving you loads more screen space for your money.On the back, the gadget has a strange neon-like visual design that looks like a cascading 'V' when light catches it at certain angles.Honor calls this its aurora nanotexture design.The phone comes in four colours: Midnight Black, Sapphire Blue and Phantom Blue.The Sun10 The screen is impressive given the View 20's modest priceHonor10 It's got a sleek design that's almost all screenHonor View 20 specs – what's under the bonnet?Honor has packed a lot of top tech into the View 20 considering it's a mid-range model.The handset is loaded with a ground-breaking 48MP rear camera – a world first.The View 20's selfie camera is also impressive, coming in at 25 MP.The rear snapper captures several photos at once and uses AI to take the best details from each and combine them into one picture.Its clever software also boosts your shots in low-light, a task phone cameras have traditionally struggled with compared to digital cameras.2017 Future Publishing10 The View 20 is the followup to last year's View 10 (pictured)Its smart camera software can even give you information on 300 famous landmarks, 10,000 paintings and even the calorie count of your food just by taking a look at them.The View 20 display packs a 2310 x 1080 pixel mix, which means it's far from the sharpest on the market.The phone is powered by a high-end octa-core Kirin 980 chipset – the same top tech that drives the Huawei Mate 20 and Huawei Mate 20 Pro.Honor has also packed some swanky Wi-Fi technology into the View 20 that stops the signal from weakening when your hands cover the receiver.The Sun10 As well as the View 20 (right), Honor also unveiled the Honor WatchWhat is the Honor Watch?

I couldn’t breathe by yourself, I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t really see, it was scary. I was pretty out of it but on day two on looked in the mirror and just cried.”Sophie has been dancing since she was three and had been practising fire breathing for five years.She said: ""There’s always going to be a worry because it’s a risky job, but I’ve always done everything to the book safety wise. It was a shock, a freak accident. “After her skin started to heal, Sophie was flown back to the UK. She thought she was over the worst of it and kept the true horror of the accident a secret from friends and family.Sophie Lee13 Sophie was just 23 and performing in Chicago when the accident happenedSophie Lee13 At first, Sophie's scars were flat - and she thought they had started to heal without a skin graftSophie Lee13 But her scars then grew back at keloids - benign tumours on her faceBut then keloid scars started growing on her face and chin. Keloids are benign tumours which grow in areas of trauma and are more common in people with olive, black or Oriental skin like Sophie, who has Chinese heritage.Sophie, who now lives in Manchester, said: “They developed two months after the accident and they will be with me for life. It's just a case of taming and getting it flattening with steroid injections or laser.""At first the keloids knocked my confidence because I didn’t know what it was. Up until then the scar was just flat. I thought ‘great, my skin’s healed itself, it’s going to be OK’, and then all of a sudden the skin started raising, it kept growing and growing.""Sophie, who is in legal talks with the organisers of the event, struggled to accept her scars. She admits her former life was very “vanity based” and she’d often share her day-to-day life with her 33,900 Instagram followers.What are keloid scars? Some scars grow lumpy and larger than the wound they're healing – this is called keloid scarring.When the skin is broken – for example, by a cut, bite, scratch, burn, acne or piercing – the body produces more of a protein called collagen.Collagen gathers around damaged skin and builds up to help the wound seal over.The resulting scar usually fades over time, becoming smoother and less noticeable.But some scars don't stop growing, invading healthy skin and becoming bigger than the original wound.These are known as keloid scars, which affect around 10-15 per cent of all wounds.Keloid scars are more common on the upper chest, shoulders, head and neck, but they can happen anywhere.They can appear:shinyhairlessraised above the surrounding skinhard and rubberyred or purple at firstThey can last for years and sometimes don't form until months after the initial injury.Experts don't fully understand why keloid scarring happens.They are not contagious or cancerous.Treatment:There are several treatments available, but none have shown to be more effective than others.These include:steroid injectionsapplying silicone gel sheeting for several monthsfreezing early keloids with liquid nitrogenlaser treatment to reduce rednesssurgerySource: NHS ChoicesSophie Lee13 Katie said her spell in hospital was a 'scary, scary time'Sophie Lee13 Despite her scars, Sophie says she's more confident in her skin now than ever beforeSophie Lee13 Pictured before her accident, Sophie admits her former life was quite 'vanity based'But now she's on a mission to inspire young girls to love their looks.

She has no friends and is at home with their kids all the time.""They live in Maryland, which is really quiet, so if they do go out it's bowling or cinema with the kids.""The Mega Agency15 Now Coleen is more likely to pick up a takeaway Nando's to enjoy at home than eat outMaryland, a 50-minute drive from Washington DC is a world away from Cheshire and the Rooney's former closest city Manchester, which are full of upmarket clubs and restaurants and a popular haunt for celebs.In contrast, their closest city, Maryland City, has a population of just 16,000 and has more of a small town American feel.The Rooneys were originally thought to be moving to the Kalorama District, closer to Washington DC's centre, but instead seem to have opted for a home in quieter suburbs.""They have a massive house and it's beautiful but it's not the exciting glamorous life she's used to. She's very homesick and misses her parents,"" says our source.15 Our source says the Rooneys are based in quiet Maryland, and they often post Instagram pics showing them chilling at home'Coleen can't cope without a break from the kids'Soon after moving to the US, Liverpool-born Coleen said: ""It’s hard not being able to pop down the road – an eight-hour flight is a long distance. You can’t just nip over for a cup of tea.“It’s been a bit of a blur so far getting everything sorted. I am sure it will all sink in soon.”Instagram15 Behind the smiles, a source says Coleen is struggling with childcare alone and missing her familyColeen was known for her regular holidays in destinations such as Barbados, having six last year and often bringing mum Colette along.However, these seem to have dried up since moving to Washington, and Coleen appears to have stayed put in recent months, apart from her trip back to the UK for Christmas.Splash News15 Coleen and mum Colette on holiday in Barbados with then-baby son KlayColeen has previously said she'd never hired nannies to help her with the kids but mum Colette - who lived just down the road - was close at hand to assist with her and Wayne's massive brood, Kai, Klay, Kit and Cass.Without this, she's struggling our insider says: ""Before she left the UK to go back to the States at Christmas, Coleen told friends her first job would be to find a babysitter as she can't cope without a break from the kids every now and then.""15 The family have had quieter times together since moving to WashingtonBoth Coleen and Wayne's social media accounts reflect this change, with their more recent Instagram pictures showing them visiting landmarks in the city, the Six Flags theme park in New Jersey and chilling out at their £3million mansion in the Maryland suburbs.15 The couple's Instagram posts from the US show them taking the kids to places such as the Six Flags theme parkAnd it's not just her choice of hangout that's different. While in Washington Coleen's toned down her WAG look from her perma-tanned, blow-dry days for a more laid-back American look.She's more likely to be photographed leaving pilates classes wearing leggings, with natural makeup and clutching a green juice at the £200-a-month local Equinox gym than hitting the party circuit in Washington DC.15 Coleen has swapped her glam WAG outfits for no make-up and a more laid back look""She only goes to the gym and that's it. In the UK her mum and dad help out loads so she can go out with her mates but she has no help there,"" says our source.Missing the VIP lifestyleThe couple clearly couldn't wait to get back to their glamorous lifestyle at the first chance they got, leaving the kids with Coleen's parents so they could go out.Our source added: ""The second Wayne and Coleen came back to the UK they were out all the time with their mates drinking and at Soho Farmhouse too.""15 They went straight to Soho Farmhouse when they got home - a far cry from their mundane shopping trips in the USPreviously, the Rooneys would be guests of honour at various Manchester events, including attending a Drake concert at the arena in 2016 and sitting ringside at boxing eventsAs 'Queen of WAGs' in the UK, Coleen was often spotted at events such as the Chester Races with Darren Fletcher's wife Hayley and Helen Evans, wife of Jonny Evans among others.The couple were also regularly snapped at footballer's weddings, including Phil Jones and Kaya Hall's Alderley Edge nuptials in June 2017 and Tom Cleverley and TOWIE star Georgina Dorsett's in 2015.Instagram15 Former 'Queen of WAGs' Coleen would previously attend glam events such as the 2017 Chester races with her pals         View this post on Instagram           Always great to catch up with Ed.

Chelsea have three Premier League legends out of contract this summerFernando Llorente (Spurs)A panic buy that really has not worked out for either party. Brought in the summer of 2017 from under the noses of Chelsea but has been living in a Harry Kane-shaped shadow ever since.Without a Premier League start this season, Llorente looks destined for the exit door with Galatasaray reportedly close to agreeing personal terms.SunSport says: Could well do a job at a number of struggling Premier League sides for the remainder of the season - think Huddersfield, Crystal Palace, Southampton.Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool)AS well documented, he had his off-field issues last year which means a cloud of uncertainty hovers over Daniel Sturridge.On his day he is still a fine talent - as he showed against Chelsea earlier in the season - and reports suggest he is set to be offered a new deal by the Reds.SunSport says: He has got used to playing a bit-part role under Jurgen Klopp but at 29 should push himself to be a regular starter elsewhere.James Milner (Liverpool)Reuters9 Liverpool should fight to tie down James Milner to a new dealONE of the best players in English football in 2018 as he showed a fresh energy to take Liverpool to the Champions League final and top of the Premier League by New Year.Chipped in with a few goals as well this season and has remained a key figure despite the likes of Naby Keita and Fabinho coming in.SunSport says: Liverpool HAVE to give this man a new contract - it is as simple as that.GUNNER LEAVE?

Man Utd set for major overhaul with Herrera, Mata and Jones among SEVEN stars out of contract this summerEuropeAdrien Rabiot (PSG)The Mega Agency9 Much has been discussed about Rabiot's future with Prem clubs circlingTHE Rabiot saga is beginning to turn ugly for Paris Saint-Germain. The midfielder has fallen out with the club and is destined to leave.He looks as though he will sulk for the rest of his contract meaning the French champions will not get a penny for him in the summer.SunSport says: A number of Premier League clubs will no doubt be monitoring Rabiot’s situation but Barcelona are in pole position.Diego Godin (Atletico)A FINE central defender who has delivered year after year for Atletico Madrid both in LaLiga and in the Champions League.Manchester United made a move last year but were quickly rebuffed but Godin is yet to sign a new deal.SunSport says: Still has plenty to offer as a defender and leader but reports in Spain say he is unlikely to extend his contract beyond the summer, paving the way for a free move.Hector Herrera (Porto)AN exciting central midfielder who Arsenal have been looking at as a replacement to Aaron Ramsey.Herrera held talks with his former gaffer Julen Lopetegui during his brief stint at Real Madrid but a move to Italy looks most likely.SunSport says: Inter Milan and Roma are the two favourites to land the Mexico international with Arsenal’s interest cooling.Mario Balotelli (Nice)AFP9 Mario Balotelli has found goals hard to come by this season at NiceLAST season Balotelli scored 26 goals in 38 games. This season he has zero goals in ten games.It has not gone well for Super Mario under Patrick Vieira at Nice and he has now been banished from training.SunSport says: It looked like he was getting his career back on track but apparently not. There will certainly not be a long queue for his signature come the summer and could well return to Italy.Gianluigi Buffon (PSG)COULD this man be back on the move again? After leaving Juventus for Paris Saint-Germain at the end of last season, his dream of winning the Champions League is still on for now.Both he and Alphonse Areola have played 13 games so far this season as Thomas Tuchel alternates the pair but the French World Cup winner is surely the long-term ever-present.SunSport says: If he wins the Champions League this season, he will almost certainly retire. If not, he may try one more season and then hang up his gloves and bring the curtain down on a fine career.Dani Alves (PSG)FORCED out of the World Cup with a cruciate ligament injury, Alves has finally worked his way back into first-team action at Paris Saint-Germain.At 35 and with an honours list longer than a Christmas shopping list, Alves may still have something left to give.SunSport says: It would have been great to see him in the Premier League after he left Barcelona but no club can surely justify his big wages. PSG could still get some use out of him, though - as could the Chinese Super League.Arjen Robben (Bayern)Getty9 Arjen Robben could finally leave Bayern Munich on a free this summerTHE Dutch winger has enjoyed a stellar decade at Bayern Munich but confirmed he would be leaving the club at the end of the season.Robben did say that he would not be retiring, though, if the right offer comes and as he turns 35 later in January, he will surely have a few to choose from.SunSport says: There is no obvious next step for him. A return to PSV Eindhoven, a move to the MLS, Middle East or China could all be possible.Franck Ribery (Bayern)RIBERY will follow his partner in crime out of Bavaria and bring an end to an era for the Bundesliga club.He will be 36 come the summer but is still delivering week after week for the German champions and is more than capable of doing a job.SunSport says: Like Robben, it would be fantastic to see Ribery stay in Europe - maybe the Frenchman could go back to Marseille - but one final lucrative offer may be the only thing preventing him hanging up his boots.Catch up on all the midweek Premier League action from Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday's games"

He said he didn’t see the point of marriage and he didn’t like being the centre of attention.“But after I was admitted to the hospice, I told the staff it was my dying wish to marry Keith and they started making arrangements – before I even had chance to ask him.“I had to ring him quickly and this time – after thousands of proposals – he said yes.“I am so glad I finally have the man of my dreams. Life has been cruel to me in some ways but now, I feel like the luckiest woman in the world.”WE PAY FOR YOUR STORIES!Fabulous Online is always on the lookout for jaw-dropping, tear-jerking and heart-wrenching stories to feature. Join our Facebook group  or email us us to make £££s by sharing your story. Focus Features11 Some of the proposal letters Cleo left for KeithFocus Features11 Cleo begged Keith to be her husband for yearsCleo and Keith first met in 1988, when he was working as a postman. He said: “I was on my rounds and I noticed Cleo doing handstands in her garden and I really fancied her. We got chatting and got on really well.”But Cleo was eight years older, with a toddler daughter, and she felt the age gap was too big.She said: “I knew Keith was the man for me – I had no doubt.""But I also knew he was far too young and he needed to enjoy life. So I refused to go out with him and I told him to forget about me. Deep down, I knew we’d be together one day – just not yet.”Focus Features11 The couple fell heads over heels in love but Cleo was worried about the age gapFocus Features11 The couple enjoyed happier times before Cleo developed a terminal lung diseaseCleo moved away and had a baby son. Keith had other relationships, too. But three years on, they bumped into each other on the bus and this time, Cleo felt the time was right.She said: “Keith was 21 by now and he had grown up a lot. We started dating and moved in together and we were blissfully happy. He was a fabulous step-dad to my two children – I couldn’t have asked for a better partner or dad.“Funny, when we first met, Keith told me he would never have kids or pets or get married. He ended up with two kids, 11 cats and a wife.”In 2004, on their first leap year together, Cleo proposed in a Chinese restaurant. Keith refused.I proposed to him practically every dayCleo Campbell50Cleo said: “It didn’t put me off. I proposed to him practically every day, sometimes I would do a straight proposal, sometimes I would write it on a note or inside a birthday card.""Sometimes, I’d leave him a shopping list with ‘When are you going to marry me?’ at the end. But he would never set a date.”During Christmas 2008, Cleo picked up a nasty chest infection which refused to clear and tests showed she was suffering with lung disease.Focus Features11 Cleo would ask him to marry her dailyShe said: “I was very ill for a while, but I got back on my feet. I was warned my condition was life-limiting but I didn’t dwell on it – I worked full time and I brought the kids up and we were very happy.“I kept on with my proposals – even as I was being loaded in an ambulance, I would say: ‘Marry me, Keith, I don’t want to die single!’ and all the paramedics would try and persuade him.“His mum, Rosaline, was desperate for us to marry too – she was always on his case. We went to loads of family weddings and it made me long to be a bride – but it had the opposite effect on Keith.”Focus Features11 Friends rushed round to organise Cleo's dream dayFocus Features11 Cleo says everyone cried tears of happiness for herIn September this year, Cleo’s health deteriorated and she was admitted to Bolton Hospice.She said: “One of the night staff asked me what I wanted most in the world and I said it was to get married. She told me she could arrange it and I didn’t really think she was serious.""But the next morning, the staff were coming in, asking me what type of dress and flowers I would like, and I realised in a panic that I had better ask Keith.""She continued: “I rang him up, and said: ‘Listen babe, will you marry me?’ and he replied: ‘I do think it’s about time - yes.’Focus Features11 Cleo enjoys a holiday before she became illHospice staff began sourcing flowers, make up and nail artists, party food, balloons – and even Cleo’s favourite rainbow roses flown in from Holland. The couple were married in front of 30 close family and friends.Despite her condition, Cleo insisted on walking down the aisle, with Keith’s step-dad, Philip, giving her away, and her daughter, Sarah, as bridesmaid.Cleo said: “It was the most romantic moment of my entire life. I had the best day ever. Everyone was crying but for me, they were tears of happiness.“After years of trying, I finally have the man of my dreams.”Keith added: “I wasn’t half as nervous as I’d expected.

44,I suffered with stomach pains for months but I had no idea I was pregnant until giving birth on Christmas Day,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/8048433/no-idea-pregnant-until-gave-birth/,"23rd December 2018, 10:30 pm","ALICE CRANFIELD was woken last Christmas by a shock visitor – not Santa Claus but a baby she had no idea was coming.Alice, 20, did not know she was pregnant until crippling stomach cramps roused her just before midnight on Christmas Eve.6 Even at seven months pregnant, Alice was still wearing her size 6 jeansShe rushed to the bathroom and a few moments later, just after midnight, Alice gave birth to a boy with the help of her parents, who had raced in.While baby George was the best possible surprise, Alice hopes this Christmas — her son’s first birthday — will be less eventful.The travel agent, from Bury, Lancs, says: “Looking back, it is crazy I didn’t know I was pregnant but there were no signs.“I didn’t have morning sickness and when I had stomach ache and a bit of indigestion, I thought I was eating badly.Matthew Pover/Matthew Pover Limited.6 Although baby George was unexpected, Alice wouldn't change a thing“I was still a size six when George was born and I was on the Pill, which stopped my periods. I started taking it at 13 to ease my painful, heavy periods.“It stopped them completely, so it was years since I’d had a period regularly. Even when I did a pregnancy test, it was negative. It is unbelievable — but now I’m a mum, I wouldn’t change it for the world.”Alice suffered stomach pains in November 2017 but after a pregnancy test came back negative, she went to her GP. The doctor suggested she might have irritable bowel syndrome.Alice — who lives with mum Julie, 50, a customer services advisor, and dad Greg, also 50, a commercial director — says: “If I ate certain things, such as bread and cheese, my stomach would bloat.Matthew Pover/Matthew Pover Limited.6 Alice had to convince her parents that she had no idea she was pregnant“I was wearing size-six jeans and the only time they felt tight was after I’d eaten. Other than that, there were no signs to make me think I was pregnant, let alone eight months gone.”Blood tests showed her iron levels were low but, Alice says: “The doctor felt my stomach, which seemed normal, and repeated the pregnancy test, which again was negative. Even the blood tests didn’t pick it up. When a doctor says your symptoms are down to IBS, you believe it.“I was advised to follow a gluten-free diet and was going to have more investigations in the New Year. I had absolutely no idea I was carrying a baby.”Two days before Christmas, the stomach pains started. But Alice put it down to a Chinese takeaway she’d had.6 Alice and George were taken by ambulance to North Manchester General HospitalShe says: “As soon as I had eaten it, I didn’t feel well. I’d cut out takeaways until then, so I was mad at myself. I was convinced I had IBS and this was another flare-up.""I just wanted was to sleep but was in a lot of pain. I fell asleep eventually but woke up just before midnight with terrible stomach cramps and a strong urge to go to the loo.""I didn’t want to wake Mum and Dad as it was late but I knew something wasn’t right. Sitting on the toilet made the pain worse, so I got on to my hands and knees and started taking deep breaths.“That was when I felt a heavy pressure down below. It is a blur but I felt I needed to push. I didn’t know what was happening but my body was telling me to get on with it.”Matthew Pover/Matthew Pover Limited.6 The 20-year-old says George 'is the best surprise gift' she could have ever wished forMinutes later, Alice gave birth to a 6lb, 4oz boy, who she later named George after a much-loved childhood doll.Alice, herself an only child, says: “It was surreal. George was still in the amniotic sac, so he looked more like an alien than a newborn. I screamed to for help. Mum and Dad came rushing in and I was sobbing.“I told them over and over that I had no idea I was pregnant. I was worried they’d think I had kept it from them. While Dad called for an ambulance, Mum pierced the sac with her fingernail.""Hearing George cry for the first time, I was sobbing and shaking. Dad tied a shoelace around the umbilical cord while we waited for the paramedics.”Matthew Pover/Matthew Pover Limited.6 Alice's dad tied a shoelace around the umbilical cord while the family waited for the paramedicsAlice and George were taken by ambulance to North Manchester General Hospital, where they stayed until Boxing Day.Alice says: “Most new mums have nappies and clothes for their baby but I had nothing. It was Christmas Day, so all the big shops were shut.“Mum and Dad bought nappies from a petrol station and asked friends for essentials such as a Moses basket, changing mat and a car seat. It felt like I was living a dream and would wake up at any moment.”Yes, it does happenDR NICOLA WILLIAMS, a GP from Castleford, West Yorks, says: “For most mums, it seems unbelievable a woman could be pregnant for nine months and not realise. ""But it is more common than you might think.“Some women who may not normally have periods, or who have erratic periods, may not realise when they become pregnant.“Weight gain, morning sickness, heartburn and fatigue don’t always happen or can be very mild.""Even a baby kicking can be mistaken for indigestion or pre-existing tummy problems.“If you have a retroverted womb – one that points backwards – you may not show until much later, or not at all.“A positive pregnancy test is around 99 per cent accurate but is never 100 per cent.""It is possible to get a ‘false negative’ for lots of reasons, including not taking the test properly, taking it too early or reading it incorrectly.”She worried that George might have health problems, having led a normal lifestyle during her pregnancy. She says: “I’d been drinking on nights out and eating all the things you’re meant to avoid when you’re expecting a baby.“In June last year I was in a car accident — I would’ve been three months pregnant at the time. I twisted my back and had physio. I dread to think what might have happened. We’re so lucky he’s completely healthy.“I didn’t feel George kicking, which the midwives think was down to the position he was laying in. And my placenta was at the front.”A year on, Alice can’t imagine life without George.

It is something you have to resort to, not a characteristic of your game.""Il Capitano's talent of snuffing out a threat allowed him to play for 25 years with only one club, where he holds the appearance record with 902 matches for Milan.Instagram/Paolo Maldini28 Now living in Miami, Maldini spends a lot of time with his familyInstagram/Paolo Maldini28 Maldini has made lots of money buying and selling real estate in the USIf I have to make a tackle then I have already made a mistake.Paolo MaldiniMaldini's 647 appearances are a Serie A record.He was a regular starter until he retired in 2009 and long after his body was past its peak, Maldini was still able to chase - and beat - opponents more than a decade younger than him.PLAY-BO Christian Vieri now lives the playboy life in Miami – playing beach soccer, chilling with model girlfriend and running clothing labelSir Alex Ferguson loved him, making numerous attempts to try and sign the star he described as his ""favourite"" non-Manchester United player.The one-club man's career saw him win seven Serie A titles and the Champions League FIVE times - only Real Madrid great Paco Gento has more.The international stage was a cruelly mistress, with Maldini's Italy beaten on penalties in the final of the 1994 World Cup and by a golden goal at the Euro 2000 Final.During his time with the national team they also reached semi-finals at Euro 1988 and the 1990 World Cup, on home soil.Paolo Maldini factfileAC MILANClub record 902 appearances for AC MilanSerie A record 647 league appearancesMost Champions League final appearances with 8 (tied with Paco Gento)Five Champions League wins: 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003, 2007Seven Serie A titles: 1988, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1999, 2004One Coppa Italia: 2003One Club World Cup: 2007ITALYThird most caps with 126Beaten finalist at 1994 World Cup and Euro 2000INDIVIDUALEuropean Championship team of the tournament: 1988, 1996, 2000World Cup team of the tournament: 1990, 1994, 2002Ballon d'Or third place: 1994, 2003Champions League final man of the match: 2003Uefa Team of the Year: 2003, 2005Serie A defender of the year: 2004Instagram/Paolo Maldini28 Maldini and Christian Vieri, right, made millions selling a plot of land in New York CityInstagram/Paolo Maldini28 Maldini pictured with rap superstar DrakeInstagram/Paolo Maldini28 The Italian has been married to Venezuelan model Adriana Fossa since 1994Instagram/Paolo Maldini28 Sir Alex Ferguson described Maldini as his 'favourite' non-Manchester United playerInstagram/Paolo Maldini28 Pictured with actor and comedian Kevin HartStill, he was named in the team of the tournament at two World Cups and three European Championships and while he never won the Ballon d'Or - defenders rarely do - he came second in 1994 and 2003.He was also named in the all-time World Cup dream team in 2002.The immaculately dressed Maldini could have been an actor or a model, and even turned down an offer from Armani to model their clothes at the World Cup.Maldini is still the king of cool on the other side of the Atlantic.The Italian splits his time between Milan, Miami and New York City where he has a number of investments and business interests.Instagram/Paolo Maldini28 Maldini with his sons Daniel, second left, and Christian, second from right, and a bunch of their friendsInstagram/Paolo Maldini28 Paolo Maldini pictured with NBA star Manu GinobiliInstagram/Adriana Fossa28 Maldini, his wife and two sons relax on a yacht on holidayWhen I think of the current generation, Lionel Messi is top-level...

If you make a mistake, you won’t be blacklisted by other businesses and people will still come back as there aren’t any other companies doing the same thingNever make the same mistake twice: It sounds obvious, but make sure you learn from your mistakesPut your ideas to action: A goal without a plan is just a dream, and your business idea will never become reality unless you make a plan and act on itHe received a start-up business loan worth just under £9,000 from the Canadian Youth Business Foundation and his Canadian bank also matched it, so he received a rough total of £18,000.“It was kind of scary when I got it, because I had no job so I ended up using some of it on rent and food.“By the time I ended up using it for the business, I had already blown through £4,000 on living expenses.”He moved back to the UK and Blackpool in the end of 2012 as his relationship came to an end, and was forced to move back in with his parents.Yet he decided to continue with the business the following year.6 The company started in toys but is now branching out into children's picture books too“The business was still really small, but no one was doing it in the UK or Europe.“It was just a great market for it.”He began in his parent’s house with a mobile phone and laptop, and eventually needed an office as well as another staff member.He managed to get a shared office in Blackpool town centre for £100 per month for a table.Lee also hired an apprentice for £125 a week to help him with the service side of things - and it was all he could afford at the time.Today the business is expecting an annual turnover of £1.4million for this financial year, and it’s also branching into children’s picture books.The toys are manufactured in China where it has six factories, but Cubbies also has three warehouses - Canada, the UK and the US - as well as distributors in Australia, Russia and Israel.Lee says it sells 150,000 toys a year around the world - with the US and the UK taking around 25 per cent of the market each.6 He met his wife Fiona when he hired her as a translator for one of his toy factoriesThe toys are today available in 25 countries and they have 2,000 retailers signed up and ready to personalise each Cubby.He says it’s the first time he’s actually being creative, something he only realised he was good at once he started with Cubbies.But Lee, who’s currently expecting his first child with his wife Fiona, 27, fell into the toy industry simply by working for Parkdale in Canada.He met Fiona, whose real Chinese name is actually Yuanyuan, when he hired her as a translator for one of this toy factories.“I’ve gone from toys to story books, and now I’m working on how the story should be led with the pictures.“It’s totally different to toys, but the idea is about creating something.“And it’s what I absolutely love.”Most read in money'HE WON'T STRUGGLE' Jamie Oliver's staff lash out as 1k jobs cut in restaurant collapse POUNDED Fraudsters are nicking £674 PER MINUTE in 'out-of-control' bank transfer cons SUMMER TIME Aldi is selling an electric patio heater with a speaker FRAUD WARNING Mum lost £780 a month benefits after loan firm assigned her Universal Credit BONUS TIME Sainsbury's is offering 10p a litre off fuel and 150 extra Nectar card points PUMP WARS Supermarkets pushing up price of petrol on a DAILY basis, RAC claims Keen to run your own business but could do with some inspiration?We recently spoke to the 31-year-old GCSE dropout who started £30million fashion empire In The Style with just £1,000.We've also chatted with Josh Luber who turned his love of trainers into a £777million stock market for sneakers StockX.And we find out how a former NHS nurse launched a dog rehab and spa – and it now makes £85,000 a year.This dad-of-one converted an American school bus into a restaurant - and it now makes £400K a yearWe pay for your stories!

51,Mum-of-four Peta Todd on sex education and how to talk to kids about what makes a baby,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/7854399/peta-todd-on-sex-education/,"29th November 2018, 2:33 am","EACH week mum-of-four Peta, married to Olympic cyclist Mark Cavendish, talks about family life. This week, her topic is sex education.I RECENTLY hosted an event for Superdrug in the run-up to World AIDS day – which is this Saturday, December 1.Stewart Williams - The Sun4 Mum-of-four Peta Todd thinks we have to sack off the narrative of 'when two people love each other very much, magic happens'The message of the event was that we should all know our “status” to take control of our sexual health and wellbeing.The high-street chain is the first to sell a do-it-yourself HIV test. The BioSURE HIV Self test kit is available for £33.95.The panel at the event included Dr Alex George of Love Island fame – who was a dream, I might add – and we discussed the myths around HIV that mean there is still a stigma around it.One in five people still believe you can catch AIDS from kissing or from using a toilet seat.Stewart Williams - The Sun4 Peta Todd with her 12-year-old son FinnbarMost shocking to me was that of a sample in London, the biggest increase in positive tests was among girls aged 15 to 25.Embarrassed about my own assumptions and lack of knowledge prior to the event, I decided to sit down with my son Finnbar, who’s 12, to see what his ideas around sexual health were.I was pleasantly surprised by his willingness to chat about the nitty gritty with his ol’ ma.He asked lots of questions, seemed unfazed by the answers and was a lot more composed than I was at his age.No storks dropping bundles of joyIt made me start to think about how much information is too much for our kids.My approach to all things biological has always been to tell the truth.Yes, I say “nunny bits” to my six-year-old Delilah but I also let her know it’s actually a vagina.When she wanted to know how a baby gets out, there was no talk of storks dropping bundles of joy from the sky.Stewart Williams - The Sun4 Peta thinks about how much information is too much for our kids when it comes to sex educationBeing open in discussions about sex and reproduction is important for children to develop good mental attitudes towards their bodies and their peers.Does my son love knowing about periods? Nope. But it’s just as important for him to know as it is for my daughter.I don’t think our children need to see graphic images from the karma sutra . . . but leaving their schooling to basic sex education is not enough in a world where porn and fake news lurk online.Do you have funny names for private parts in your house or is it biology central?Stewart Williams - The Sun4 Peta explains why sex education is important as it is something that is going to play such a key role in our young people’s livesDoes magic make a baby? Or is it Mummy and Daddy?MOST READ IN FABULOUSCommentTHE SUN SAYS PM's desperate Brexit capitulation achieved nothing but alienating everyone CommentDAMIAN GREEN How Tory leadership race can lead to every Brit having a shot at the good life CommentJANE MOORE Time for something completely different…let's put the boot in at EU elections CommentTHE SUN SAYS Hipster who threw MILKSHAKE achieved nothing but to recruit more Farage fans CommentNICK TIMOTHY Tinderbox Tories will get burned at the ballots - they need a new plan CommentALLY ROSS Graham Norton shouldn't have spared Madge's blushes as he lashed Eurovision acts People get squeamish about ruining youngsters’ innocence with too much information about sex, hoo-hoos and ding-dongs.But with something that is going to play such a key role in our young people’s lives, and with so many Chinese whispers already in play, it is time we got real. We need to sack off the narrative of “when two people love each other very much, magic happens”.Also, you get serious parent points if you can say the word “penis” with a straight face.Celebrity Big Brother fans cringe as Natalie asks Sally about her sex life and explains what an orgy is"

We were particularly impressed with the latest model – read our OnePlus 6T review for details.This success partly explains how it’s been able to wrangle a partnership with a premium brand like McLaren.“McLaren and OnePlus were born in a similar way – with a big dream to create something special.“Starting from nothing, we challenged ourselves to never settle,” said OnePlus chief Pete Lau.“Today we unveil a true testament to innovation, a salute to speed.”This isn’t the first time OnePlus has partnered with outsider brands.Back in 2017, OnePlus teamed up with the Paris-based retailer Colette for a special edition of the OnePlus 3T.And more recently, the OnePlus 5 received a special limited edition makeover courtesy of designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac.OnePlus4 The details of the partnership are a secret – perhaps a new mobile racing game is in the works?Last year in India, OnePlus celebrated its local anniversary by creating a Star Wars version of the OnePlus 5T.But perhaps the most exciting partnership came in April this year, when OnePlus teamed up with Marvel Studios.The two firms worked together to produce a Marvel Avengers Limited Edition version of the OnePlus 6.The latest model – the OnePlus 6T – currently has no special edition variants, which could explain what the McLaren partnership is all about.OnePlus4 It's also possible that OnePlus is working on a limited edition version of its new OnePlus 6TMOST READ IN TECHCORE OF THE PROBLEM?

Alonso is a great Formula One driver.He is retiring from F1 to pursue his dream of winning the ‘Triple Crown’ - victories in the Monaco F1 GP, the Le Mans 24 hour race and the Indy 500.AP:Associated Press12 Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were fierce rivals as team-mates at McLarenEPA12 Fernando Alonso won 32 GPs in all, including this 2010 success in BahrainIt's up for debate how prestigious this trinity is.Only Graham Hill has complete the set yet it has only really become a thing since Alonso started mentioning it.Nevertheless, the history books will show the Spaniard has won 32 F1 races.His two world titles came in 2005 and 2006 when he was with Renault and the way he delivered in his first season in the World Endurance Championship also marks him out as one of the best on four wheels.AP:Associated Press12 Fernando Alonso won the world title with Renault in 2005 and 2006, helped by this triumph in the 2005 Chinese GPReuters12 Fernando Alonso enjoys his victory lap at the Japanese GP in October 2006Yet for all his talent, of which there is no doubt, he should be departing the sport as a more-decorated individual.Instead, he is leaving with the reputation for some as one of the sport's unluckiest champions.Unlucky because he missed out on winning the title with McLaren in 2007 when he was embroiled in an intra-team battle with Lewis Hamilton before subsequently jumping ship while Hamilton won it the following year?Unlucky because he missed out when he was at Ferrari and came up against a dominant Sebastian Vettel in a rampant Red Bull in 2012 and 2013?Reuters12 Some pundits and fans have labelled Fernando Alonso as one of the unluckiest drivers in Formula One - and he is now departing from the sportGetty Images - Getty12 Fernando Alonso will have another stab at the Indianapolis 500 - which he contested last year - as part of his bid for the 'Triple Crown'Unlucky because he rejoined McLaren in 2015 for around £25million a year as their partnership with Honda failed spectacularly while Ferrari took off?People say you make your own luck but perhaps the other perspective, that it is down to poor career choices, could equally be applied.Let's not forget, this is the man who counts Flavio Briatore as one of his advisors.The same man who instigated one of the sport's darkest times through bad judgement.EPA12 Highly controversial Flavio Briatore has been an advisor to Fernando AlonsoGetty Images - Getty12 Spaniard Fernando Alonso is quitting F1 to pursue his 'Triple Crown' dreamDubbed crashgate, Briatore was banned from F1 after one of his drivers, Nelson Piquet Jr, later claimed he'd been ordered to crash during the Singapore Grand Prix in 2008 and the subsequent deployment of the safety car, which in turn would benefit Alonso.While Alonso was cleared of any wrongdoing, he was named in the Spygate sage; the discovery of Ferrari intellectual property at McLaren which would end up costing the Woking based team a record £100million fine.It was somewhat ironic that he would turn back to the same team in the latter part of his career.While Alonso had always maintained top seats were still available, he found himself back at McLaren and their fledgling partnership with engine suppliers Honda.It didn't take long for the cracks in their relationship to reappear.McLaren's Executive Chairman at the time, Ron Dennis, had first-hand experience of dealing with Alonso before.Reuters12 Fernando Alonso enjoys 2005 title glory at Sao Paulo after coming third in BrazilDennis was also adamant that the team would only progress and challenge the likes of Mercedes and Ferrari if they had their own engine supplier onboard, not to mention the huge investment Honda pumped in.The problem for Dennis was two fold. Honda's engine was unreliable and Alonso hated it.His criticism of Honda was relentless and toe-curling, it was embarrassing at times as he publicly shamed Honda.Yet while Dennis was ousted during an internal power struggle, at the end of 2017, McLaren ditched Honda and retained Alonso.AP:Associated Press12 Fernando Alonso was cleared of blame after team-mate Nelson Piquet Jr said Renault told him to deliberately crash to help the Spanish driverLewis Hamilton celebrates being crowned Formula One world champion for fifth time after fourth place finish in MexicoHe'd won his war yet it was all in vain as, despite using Renault's engines this season, his season has been a series of struggles for points, often requiring his abundance of skill just to finish in the top 10.His frustration all too apparent, he has taken pop-shots at F1, insisting that his decision to quit was not down to a lack of options at competitive teams but down to his decision to race elsewhere and seek interesting new challenges.Interesting then, that when he announced his plans to quit F1 after this weekend that he would implicate F1's owners in his press release, praising them for trying to change his mind about leaving.It sparked rumours Liberty had spoken to leading teams to encourage them to sign Alonso, giving the impression that they - or F1 - couldn't do without him.most read in motorsportLatest'A LEGEND HAS LEFt us' F1 icon Niki Lauda dies aged 70 - months after lung transplant warningWEIGHT AND SEE Bone-crunching moment powerlifter's leg SNAPS in horror accident PicturedMY HERO Lewis Hamilton's emotional tribute to 'bright light' Niki Lauda after F1 icon dies RevealedNEED FOR SPEED Lauda’s wife saved his life by donating kidney before marrying in 7 minutes F1 ace How old was Niki Lauda, how did he die, and how many children did F1 legend have?

A further £1m to the University of Leicester to fund medical research and £100,000 to help re-bury Richard III.In a sport often in thrall to big bucks and the bottom line, Vichai had never forgotten it is the fans who make football and that a a club is rooted in its community.Yesterday, supporters — many in tears — gathered amid a growing sea of floral tributes at the King Power to pay tribute to a man who “made our dreams come true”.Retired Diane Statham, 59, a Foxes fan for half a century, revealed: “When we came to the stadium to get a coach for away games there would be a free breakfast of tea, coffee and bacon rolls.Who was Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha?

The monks would even splash holy water on the players’ feet.Star striker Jamie Vardy said: “It’s like you’re literally having a shower, there’s that much water going everywhere.”Once unimaginable glory soon followed. Their historic 5,000-1 Premier League win in 2016 was described by Foxes and England legend Gary Lineker as the “biggest sporting shock in history”.The following season, the provincial club reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League, where they were knocked out by Spanish giants Atletico Madrid.Former Leicester player and match-day announcer Alan Birchenall, 73, told The Sun at the time: “Walt Disney wouldn’t have dreamt this up.“There’s nowhere on the planet where they play football that our story isn’t known.”AP:Associated Press7 Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha led Leicester to their famous Prem title victorySo who was the man now mourned by football fans across the globe?Born Vichai Raksriaksorn in 1958 to well-off Thai-Chinese parents, he said that his interest in the duty-free business stemmed from passing through airports during his jet-set childhood.One rumoured story has a young Vichai stepping from the wreckage of a high-speed car crash with just cuts and bruises.He put his miracle escape down to a “lucky” golden Buddhist charm he was wearing around his neck, that he had bought with a £400 loan from his father.Today, his collection of similar charms worth around £10m are on display in a museum at King Power’s Bangkok HQ.After studying in the US and Taiwan, he invested in a Hong Kong duty-free business before taking over the King Power franchise in the 1980s.The billions would flow when King Power landed an exclusive deal to run the duty-free at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport — the 12th busiest in the world.Getty7 Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha will always be remembered as a Leicester legendThe monopoly has been described as “very controversial”.King Power faced corruption allegations over £323m said to have been owed to the Thai government — but the case was dismissed in September.The firm expanded into Cambodia, Macau and China and also invested in restaurants, hotels, solar power and a budget airline.It is now a global brand with around 10,000 employees.Vichai was close to the former King of Thailand Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016, and was given the honorific surname Srivaddhanaprabha which means “light of progressive glory”.He and wife Aimon have four children, Voramas, Apichet, nicknamed ‘Tip’, and Arunroong, who are all in their thirties, plus Aiyawatt, 30, known as Top.Worth an estimated £2.9billion, Vichai loved British life, jetting between Thailand, London’s Chelsea Wharf, and his polo stables on a 100-acre Berkshire estate.He boasted an £11m, 116-foot Sunseeker yacht and a £43m Gulfstream private jet.Getty7 Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha was an inspiration as Leicester won the leagueHis polo playing saw him rub shoulders with the Royal Family. Vichai even owned a 60-strong stable of racehorses with apt names such as Come On Leicester.Yet he also liked to shower wealth on those less fortunate than himself.He gave £23,000 to a Leicester supporter who was raising cash for research into his son’s rare genetic disorder.Karamjit Singh, chairman of Leicester’s Hospitals, who received £2m from Vichai, said: “We remain extremely grateful for the very generous donation he made towards our new children’s hospital.“He knew how to make the impossible possible and has left behind a legacy which we are committed to keeping alive.”It was a sentiment echoed by the players. They arrived at the stadium yesterday to pay their respects, having taken to social media to express their sorrow and sadness.Keeper Kasper Schmeichel said: “I’m so totally devastated and heartbroken. This club, this city, is a family. And that is all because of you.“There was absolutely nothing you wouldn’t do for us. You were so passionate.”Fans’ favourite and England hero Vardy tweeted: “Struggling to find the right words but to me you are legend.“An incredible man who had the biggest heart, the soul of Leicester City Football Club. Thank you for everything you did for me, my family and our club. I will truly miss you.”Getty7 The footballing world has been left to mourn after Vichai's deathThe wider football world united around Leicester, with tributes flooding in from across the game.The European champions said: “Real Madrid are saddened to hear of the passing of Leicester City FC owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, as well as the others involved in the helicopter accident.“The club would like to send their condolences to their families, friends and all fans of Leicester.”Fellow La Liga giants Barcelona tweeted: “Our thoughts are with the whole @lcfc family. Rest in peace.”The Bundesliga leaders added: “The thoughts of everyone at Borussia Dortmund are with Leicester City and those who have so tragically lost their lives.""Our deepest condolences with their families, friends and everyone connected to @LCFC.”And from Italy, Lazio tweeted: “Everyone would like to send their deepest condolences to the families of those who tragically lost their lives and to everyone at @LCFC. Rest in peace.”It encapsulated the huge popularity of a man whose generosity of spirit and imagination bankrolled the game’s greatest fairytale.To mark his 60th birthday earlier this year, Vichai gave away 60 free season tickets. In keeping with his kindness, prices for the last four seasons have remained frozen.Wiping away tears at the floral tributes, labourer Wayne Melbourne, 56, a lifelong fan said: “Leicester will never forget him.”Crowd burst into round of applause as Leicester City players visit the King Power Stadium to pay tribute to owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha who died in helicopter crash"

The Twilight paintjob looks a bit tacky and is a complete fingerprint magnet. No one likes a visibly greasy phone.The Sun7 The new handset is capable of charging other mobile phones simply by touching their backs togetherThe phone also feels slippery, which is a nightmare because you'll constantly be terrified of dropping this £899 mobile powerhouse.The only other point to note is that there's a triple-camera array on the back, squared up with a flash module.It looks a bit silly, but it's centred and doesn't protrude significantly, so you don't get noticeable device rocking on a flat surface – like you do with an iPhone.Overall the handset is pretty, but its rear will definitely depend on your own tastes.Huawei Mate 20 Pro specs and performance – a real speed demonHuawei's handset is powered by the company's own new Kirin 980 chip.This chip is particularly impressive because it's built on a 7nm (nanometre) manufacturing process.This means the transistors on the chip are just 7 nanometres apart.The Sun7 Huawei has fitted its new phone with three cameras (and a dual-tone flash system) on the back of the deviceTransistors are tiny electronic switches that allow computing to happen. The more transistors, the more computing you can get done.Most modern phone chips are built using a 10nm process, which means the transistor distance is greater.Huawei was able squeeze more transistors into the same amount of space, boosting computing power and energy efficiency.This is the same type of revolutionary chip we saw on Apple's new iPhone XS.We found operating the Huawei Mate 20 Pro to be smooth and fluid, which is no surprise.Huawei's mobile software has come a long way, and although it's not as clean as Apple's iOS or the Google Pixel version of Android, it's still very impressive.So what else can Huawei's new phone offer?The handset has a seriously attractive 6.39-inch screen that boasts a dense 3,120 x 1,440-pixel display panel.This model offers up 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.One of the headline features is called ""reverse charging"" – letting the phone itself act as a wireless charger.It works using the very common Qi charging standard, so popular phones – including recent Apple iPhones – support it.There's a sizeable 4,200mAh battery on board, which charges up very quickly – to 70% in 30 minutes, by official measures..Battery life was fine: the phone made it through an entire day with no problem.Other cool features include a new in-screen fingerprint scanner (invisible to the naked eye), and 3D face unlock that verifies your identity by scanning your mug.Huawei Mate 20 Pro camera – a super snapperRecent Huawei phones have been lauded over their cameras, and the new Mate 20 Pro appears to have decent photography chops too.It's got a triple camera set-up on the back built in partnership with acclaimed camera firm Leica.This is a combination of a wide-angle 40-megapixel lens (f/1.8), an ultra-wide-angle 20-megapixel lens (f/2.2), and an 8-megapixel telephoto lens (f/2.4) with built-in optical image stabilisation – for blur-free snaps.The Sun7 There's a cool AI-powered monochrome effect that keeps your subject in colour – even during live video recordingArtificial intelligence built into the camera lets Huawei detect 1,500 different scenes and scenarios, and then optimise the camera for best photographic potential.There's also a cool Sin City-style effect that turns video footage monochrome – while keeping the subject of the frame in colour.The camera was generally very impressive, capturing great detail and colour in a range of environments.We're still more enamoured with the iPhone XS when it comes to shots with very dark and very bright areas – simply due to Apple's very clever Smart HDR feature.7 The Huawei Mate 20 Pro can capture loads of detail7 Colours are accurate and vibrant, although the exposure in this shot could be better – some areas are too dark, and part of the Minstrels packet is overexposed7 Here's an example of the Huawei struggling with dynamic range – both shots fail to expose correctly, either leaving the light looking correct but the scene dark, or the light too bright but the scene lit perfectlyBut the Huawei Mate 20 Pro's camera is undoubtedly one of the best snappers on any Android phone today.Huawei Mate 20 Pro review verdict – should you buy it?The Huawei Mate 20 Pro will be a sure-fire hit with Android fans.Sure it's expensive at £899, but that's the price you pay in 2018 for top-tier handsets.And compared to Apple's pricey £1,099 to £1,449 iPhone XS Max, the Mate 20 Pro looks like a bargain.We're still not entirely sold on the design of the Mate 20 Pro, but we've spoken to others who love it – so it's definitely a Marmite look.Performance is no issue for this phone (the Kirin chip is spectacular), and the camera is extremely capable. An Instagram star, you'll soon become.This is a great rival to the Google Pixel 3 XL, and if you can handle receiving Android updates less quickly then you'll have no troubles with the Huawei model.Verdict: The Huawei Mate 20 Pro is one of the best Android phones you can buy today. If the funky back doesn't put you off, you'll enjoy a powerhouse blower that takes amazing snaps and runs like a dream.MOST READ IN TECHCORE OF THE PROBLEM?

As Nando’s fans, our fave double chicken Peri-Peri pitta with two regular sides is £13.25, which means a spend of £53 for a family of four. But you can feed the family the same meal at home using actual Nando’s sauce for under £7. Head to Tesco’s for a whole chicken, £2.56 and cook it with Nando’s Peri-Peri marinade, £2. Add fresh lettuce, 49p, and pitta bread pack-of-six, 55p, and chips for 99p. SAVING: £46Bargain bucket. A six-piece KFC Family Feast bucket costs £12.99 for chicken, four portions of chips, a tub of beans and a 1.25 litre bottle of Pepsi. To do it for less, try Sainbury’s SFC Chicken Boneless Bucket for £3, add their skinny fries (£1.15), a tin of own-label beans (30p) and a 1.5litre bottle of Pepsi Max (£1). That’s a total of £5.45. SAVING: £7.54Make a McSaving. It might seem cheap but a £4.29 Big Mac meal turns into £17.16 at the till when you are feeding four. At Asda you can get own-label skinny fries (£1), eight frozen burgers (£2), burger sauce (84p) and own-label Diet Cola (49p). Grab a six-pack of seeded burger buns (75p), slice each one in half and use the two spare buns to create the “extra” layer between the four burgers, Big Mac-style. Add a pack of cheese slices (79p) and pickled gherkins (79p), use ketchup from the cupboard, and it all works out at £6.66. SAVING: £10.50Slice the cost. A medium Meatfielder pizza from Domino’s is £17.99. The best supermarket alternative we’ve found is at Morrisons pizza counter, where you can choose your toppings and they’ll make it up, ready to be cooked at home. A 12in stuffed crust is £3.19.

68,It’s insane politicians keep treating taxpayers as a cash machine that never runs out,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7323136/tony-parsons-nhs-budget-theresa-may/,"22nd September 2018, 10:00 pm","HOW it chills the blood to hear an allegedly Conservative Prime Minister talk so casually about hiking taxes.“There will be a need to raise some money from people,” Theresa May says of a plan to give the NHS an extra £20billion a year by 2023. “The key thing is that people want to know any money that goes in is going to be spent effectively.”AP:Associated Press12 If only the PM had told us that her generous gift to the NHS was from all of usNo, Theresa — the key thing is that your Tory Government is always so bloody generous with somebody else’s money.A report by the TaxPayers’ Alliance confirms that the tax burden in this country is now at its highest for nearly 50 years.The last time Brits were squeezed like this, Labour’s Harold Wilson was puffing his pipe on the steps of 10 Downing Street.May’s plans to give the NHS a lovely 70th birthday present strike me as no different from Labour and their magic money tree.Getty Images - Getty12 Chancellor Philip Hammond seems to have forgotten that the Tories are supposed to be the party of low taxationWhy stop at £20billion a year, Theresa? Why not £50billion? Or £100billion?The Tories and Labour are both keen to show how compassionate they are, by giving away somebody else’s money.And it is grotesque virtue signalling that does not give even a passing thought to the reality of the daily struggles of working families.Doesn’t Theresa May get it? Doesn’t her old penny-pinching glumbucket of a Chancellor, Philip Hammond?Rex Features12 Not since the days of Harold Wilson has the tax burden on the British public been as great as it is todayIs this Tory Government really so clueless about the values it is meant to represent? The Tories are supposed to be the party for hard-working grafters, the party of working-class aspiration and the party of LOW taxation.Here is the theory, Theresa — the more of your money the Government lets people keep, the harder they work and the more tax revenue increases.That’s when the Government gets to spend the money as it sees fit — including pouring more money into the bottomless pit of the NHS.But the more a Government taxes the people, the more it removes the incentive to graft.Theresa May says 'tax payers will have to contribute a bit more' to the NHS after £20bn boost announcement What is the single greatest incentive to get people to work hard, earn more money, pay more taxes and enrich the Treasury?It is HOME OWNERSHIP.People yearn to own their own home. As Margaret Thatcher understood, nothing gives you a stake in society like owning your own home.Maggie knew — in her lower-middle-class blood, in her shopkeeper’s daughter bones — that nothing compels you to work long hours like having a mortgage on a home you can call your own.PA:Press Association12 What a difference a few weeks makes - as it transpired that the NHS budget bonanza would be paid for by the taxpayerIt is called working-class aspiration, and May and Hammond would not recognise it if Larry the 10 Downing Street cat dropped it on the welcome mat.Thatcher opened the floodgates to home ownership like no Prime Minister before or since. But long before Maggie, anyone in this country could own their own home if they were willing to put in the hours. And I do mean anyone.My dad was a greengrocer and my family so poor that for the first five years of my life we lived above the shop where my dad worked. But my old man had part-time jobs driving a lorry and working in a market and eventually he scraped together enough money for a deposit on the little house on the Billericay prairie, where I grew up and where my parents lived until they died.My father would not be able to own his own home today, not even if he worked himself into an early grave. After eight years of clueless Tory government, home ownership is now an impossible dream.Alamy12 Young adults in the UK today can only dream of becoming homeownersFor young couples starting a family, the property ladder will be forever beyond their reach, no matter how hard they graft. So tell me, Theresa — why the hell should that young couple ever vote Tory?For all their endless blather about the housing crisis, May and her horribly out-of-touch Tories show no sign that they are truly aware the decline in home ownership is a national tragedy.If May wants more money to throw at the NHS, why doesn’t she get it from our grotesquely bloated foreign aid budget?This week it was revealed that UK foreign aid is currently funding 100 projects in China, the booming country that is on course to become the economic powerhouse of the 21st Century.Philip Hammond's annual address at the Mansion House assesses the UK economy, mentions tax payers contributing more to the NHS and sticking to fiscal rules and reducing debtSome of these Chinese projects are in Africa, so that means the poor old British taxpayer is being obliged to fund Chinese projects in Africa. In what universe is that not insane?Surely a truly Tory Prime Minister should be diverting the £14 billion wasted in foreign aid to our collapsing NHS?Throwing the taxpayer’s money at loony development schemes is not generosity or compassion. It is not the sign of a humanitarian superpower.It is the policy of a country that is stark-raving mad, a country that treats its hard-working taxpayers like a cashpoint machine that never runs dry.Getty - Contributor12 Why hit the British taxpayer for more tax and let the likes of Starbucks get away with murder?It is the behaviour of the bankrupt man who insists on buying a drink for everyone in the pub.And while this Tory Government squeezes British taxpayers like we haven’t been squeezed for half a century, a mammoth corporation like Starbucks gets away with murder, paying just £4.5million of tax on profits of £162million — an effective tax rate of around 2.8 per cent. A nice tax rate if you can get it.Theresa May once worried people thought the Tories were the nasty party. Don’t fret, Theresa — thesedays we don’t even think you are Tories.LABOUR announces plans to hit UK betting firms with £140million a year in tax. This is provisional on Jeremy Corbyn winning a General Election.

It just can’t touch its toes any more.I’m hating Brussels spoutsEU LEADERS want the UK to have a second referendum and to keep on having referendums until we come up with the result they want.How about the best out of five, mein herr?EPA12 EU Brexit negotiator (or bully) Michel Barnier in full stick-it-to-the-UK flowYou can’t help noticing that within living memory most of these EU countries have been invaded, occupied, and had the experience of someone’s jackboot pressed against their throat.Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Greece, Holland, Belgium, all of Eastern Europe – they have all had to bend the knee and tug their forelock to deeply unpleasant fascist or communist regimes.They do not understand the British, who have not experienced the humiliation of invasion and occupation for one thousand years.The British have a reverence for democracy.Conservative MP Theresa Villiers says that having a second referendum on Brexit would be undemocraticIt is simply not shared by the bullies in Brussels.They don’t understand that the votes of 17.4million people MUST be honoured.Because when it comes to democracy, the EU has still got its L-plates on.Strictly speaking, the pros make the showSTRICTLY Come Dancing’s professionals are banding together to fight the BBC for a pay rise.

Here's everything we know so far.OnePlus2 OnePlus is asking fans to name its first-ever television setOnePlus TV – what is it?Details are thin right now – all we really know is that it's a Smart TV, which isn't exactly a revolutionary concept.It'll be built by a brand new company division, separate from the core smartphone business.And the official announcement says the company is ""taking its first steps in developing a smart TV"", which suggests OnePlus isn't very far along with development.Speaking about his new venture, OnePlus boss Pete Lau said: ""I dream about a time when technology is truly seamless, an effortless part of your life without being the focus.OnePlus2 The company is best known for its hugely popular range of smartphones – including the new OnePlus 6He continued: ""As other consumer electronics have evolved and improved our lives, televisions have remained conventional and cumbersome.""We bring inherent advantages to the industry, and with this new division, we're excited to explore the total connected user experience that can enhance everyday life.""Pete has worked in the smartphone and Blu-ray player industries for over two decades, but it remains to be seen whether he can pull off a must-have telly.OnePlus TV features and specs – what will it do?It'll be a long while before we learn about exact hardware specifications.But OnePlus has dropped at least two big hints about the capabilities of its smart telly.""For most of us, there are four major environments we experience each day: the home, the workplace, the commute, and being on-the-move,"" OnePlus founder Pete explained.""The home – perhaps the most important environment experience – is just starting to enjoy the benefits of intelligent connectivity.""Something that seems as simple as displaying the photos from your mobile phone to a television is still difficult to achieve.""With the development of AI technology, our imagination is endless – and we are looking forward to the future.""The first hint is the reference to ""intelligent connectivity"".What that probably means is you'll be able to sync your TV to smartphone very effectively, transferring content and apps between them easily.There's often very little communication between your smartphone and television, which is ironic given that they're both two of our most-used gadgets.What's not clear is whether the OnePlus TV will work seamlessly with all phones – or just OnePlus models.The other big hint is Pete's mention of ""AI technology"".OnePlus hasn't made any significant moves in the artificial intelligence space, which sets it apart from some of its keener rivals like Apple, Google and Samsung.Creating an AI-powered TV could mean a bunch of different things.At the most basic level, it could mean that your television will use machine learning to improve the user experience. That could be something as simple as making better recommendations about what shows you should watch, based on what you already like.But it could also mean creating a fully-fledged virtual assistant of its own – like Apple's Siri, Samsung's Bixby, Amazon's Alexa or the Google Assistant.What is Alexa?If you've never heard of Alexa, here's what you need to know...Alexa is an ""intelligent"" personal assistant built by Amazon.You can find her on several different devices, including Amazon's Echo speakers.Alexa responds to voice commands, and can talk back to you.She can perform thousands of different tasks, including telling you about the news or weather.But she can do more complex things too, like ordering a pizza or arranging an Uber taxi pick-up.To activate Alexa, you need to say ""Alexa"" to an Amazon Echo speaker.Alexa currently only works in English and German languages.Because she's powered by artificial intelligence, Alexa is constantly getting smarter.Alexa will also get more used to your voice, and better understand what you want her to do over time.TV makers haven't really pushed voice-controlled assistants onto their televisions in any meaningful way, so OnePlus could set its self apart there.It would also be a wise play, as the AI could also be rolled out onto OnePlus smartphones, killing two birds with one stone.Alternatively, OnePlus could simply borrow an existing virtual assistant, load that onto the TV, and save itself a load of work.OnePlus TV release date – when is it out?There's no word on an actual release date, but the official OnePlus announcement suggests the company is still in the early stages of development.That probably puts the OnePlus TV at years – rather than months – away.A OnePlus spokesperson told The Sun: ""We don't have any further news to share right now, but please stay tuned to our official channels for future updates.""So that means the best way to stay in the loop will be to keep a watchful eye on the very active OnePlus social media channels.OnePlus TV name – what will it be calledInterestingly, the OnePlus TV doesn't have a name yet.Instead, OnePlus wants fans of the brand to name their upcoming telly.""OnePlus TV is our latest exploration of how technology can improve our digital wellbeing, we couldn’t imagine a better group of people to help begin its legacy,"" a OnePlus rep explained on the brand's official forums.""To kick off this journey, we ask for your help in giving our TV product something truly special: a NAME. Of course, we’ve cooked up some prizes to give in return.""If you want to enter – and potentially win a pair of OnePlus Bullets Wireless headphones – then follow the below link:Click hereMOST READ IN TECHCORE OF THE PROBLEM?

Katy found items she liked and scoured eBay for cheap versions or learned to make them.She says: “For my shoes, I embellished my trainers with the words ‘Mrs Light’ by using a sheet of sticky diamantes (£1.99 for 775, eBay). It was much cheaper than a £120 pair from notonthehigh street.com.”Snap appy. Often, official photography can start at around £700 for the day. But Katy had another way to get the perfect pictures.She says: “We used an app called WedPics. They give you cards printed with your name and a password on. We then laid these out everywhere for people to pick up.“People could upload their photos of our wedding on the app and we get all the pictures for free.”Cut daytime guests. At £120-a-head for the day guests and £25 for evening guests, Kate reshuffled her guest list, ending up with 60 for the day and a further 50 later.She says: “We restricted day invites to family only and had more to spend on our evening party, which meant a better bash for the same number of people and saved about £2,000.Bulk buy. Katy found a way to avoid the discomfort of the bridal party standing in heels for the entire day.She says: “I bought flip-flops to wear in the evening and everyone loved it.“But even though Primark was cheap at £2 a pair, I found ten for £18 at a wholesaler — £1.80 a pair.”Designer double15 You can add a stylish touch with this vintage pendant light from Next for £7915 B&M’s Oslo metallic pendant light is more than a shade cheaper at £9.99INSTEAD of adding a stylish touch with this vintage pendant light from Next try B&M’s Oslo metallic pendant light which is more than a shade cheaper.SAVE: £69.01Reader's saving tipCAROL MACKIE, from Falkirk, says: “Don’t buy expensive water- retaining pellets for your patio tubs and hanging baskets.

Then you get old.If you ever stop to think about your future, or your parents’ future, if they are still around, what are your hopes?Alamy12 After a lifetime working we all hope we will be looked after with dignity and respect when we grow oldAfter a lifetime working, looking after a family and contributing to society, we all hope we will be looked after with dignity and respect in our twilight years.In this country that’s becoming more and more of a pipe dream.A report by Age UK reveals England’s care system is basically broken and lagging behind those in other major Western nations.As a result, old people who need care are being forced to pay substantially more out of their own pockets compared to those living in France, Italy and Spain.Getty - Contributor12 As we are living for longer, our social care system is under huge pressure but successive governments have failed our elderlyOur means-tested system — declared “harsh” by the report — sees adults having to pay for their own residential care if their savings or assets are worth more than £23,350.Even those below this threshold usually have to make some sort of contribution.As a result, thousands of families have to sell their homes every year.The system is also unfair, with dementia patients forced to pay more than those with cancer or heart disease. The sad truth is our old people are being shoved to one side.Heartwarming moment Chinese traffic cop gives piggyback to OAP struggling across busy roadWe don’t value them and we aren’t looking after them properly. Increasingly, old people are seen as a burden — because they are not productive any more.It must be very difficult to go from being head of a family, in charge of your own decisions and relied upon by family members and colleagues, to find yourself living a life where no one is interested in you and you are considered a burden.Gradually, you lose your sense of purpose and significance.At the moment, you can expect eventually to be put in the corner waiting to die — while paying for the privilege.The reality is that caring for people does not come cheap.The sad truth is our old people are being shoved to one sideKarren BradySun on Sunday ColumnistA care home costs between £30,000 and £40,000 a year, and the average cost of care in their own home for someone who needs 14 hours a week is around £11,000.In an ideal world, we would look after our ageing parents at home but that is not always possible.In the meantime, as we are living for longer, our social care system is under huge pressure. But successive governments have failed to reform it.The Government’s social care green paper, scheduled for the autumn, is expected to list a number of ways social care should be funded and improved.Changes could include making it compulsory to pay into an insurance scheme, introducing so-called “care ISAs”, and an unspecified cap on care costs.But as the report warns, “an entire generation of older people have lost out” because ministers cannot agree on how to modernise the system. I think more radical changes are called for.We should be able to afford universal elderly care and also respite for families of old people who need care.It should be a priority. The big question, of course, is how to pay for it.Getty - Contributor12 Age UK revealed that England’s care system is broken and lagging behind those in other major Western nationsWe need to stop wasting money and get our priorities right.Given how much we are failing our old people, it is mind-boggling that we spend £14billion on foreign aid.That needs to stop until we have looked after our own. We must think more strategically.For example, the government owns artworks worth at least £3.5billion yet less than three per cent of it is on display. We should sell it to raise funds to pay for social care.We also need to streamline government and stop wasting money. The TaxPayers’ Alliance says enough money has been spent on “useless projects” over the past few years — including £19,000 on a “motivational magician” and £4.2million on cars for mayors — to effectively wipe out the nation’s budget deficit. We also need to think more efficiently.Given how much we are failing our old people, it is mind-boggling that we spend £14billion on foreign aidKarren BradySun on Sunday ColumnistThe Government could potentially save £112million if they used their offices better and made cutbacks — such as the £1.5million spent on unnecessary jobs linked to HS2.These are just the tip of the iceberg and none of these changes would affect the UK at all.And yet all would go towards helping those who arguably have given the most.MOST READ IN OPINIONCommentJANE MOORE Time for something completely different…let's put the boot in at EU elections CommentDAMIAN GREEN How Tory leadership race can lead to every Brit having a shot at the good life CommentALLY ROSS Graham Norton shouldn't have spared Madge's blushes as he lashed Eurovision acts CommentTHE SUN SAYS Hipster who threw MILKSHAKE achieved nothing but to recruit more Farage fans CommentTREVOR KAVANAGH Vote for Nigel Farage's Brexit Party this week before BoJo zips into No10 CommentNICK TIMOTHY Tinderbox Tories will get burned at the ballots - they need a new plan Double standardsITV12 Why are so many people asking who will look after Holly Willoughby's kids?HUGE congrats to Holly Willoughby for landing the gig to co-host I’m A Celebrity in Australia.No doubt she will be amazing.

The answer is not Winnie the Pooh.Winnie the PoohAlamy8Mentions of the lovable Winnie the Pooh have reportedly been removed from Chinese social mediaHoney-loving Winnie the Pooh has been banned in word and picture form simply for his supposed resemblance to President Xi Jingping.The lovable bear from AA Milne's books unwittingly stumbled into becoming a symbol of resistance to the authoritarian government.The ban has been in the place since 2013, when a photo of President Xi and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was compared to Winnie the Pooh and Eeyore shaking hands.Getty Images8 Chinese President Xi Jinping, right, has been likened unto Winnie the Pooh while Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was compared to EeyoreClassical literature and filmAmazon8 Animal Farm is an allegorical novella by George Orwell reflecting events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union.If they're not going after children's cartoons, the Chinese government is attacking the other end of the spectrum - classical literature.George Orwell's Animal Farm and 1984 have been prohibited in China, as well as the Chinese puppet film Emperor's Dream.The moves make sense, when you consider the cautionary tale of 1984, and compare it to China's use of cameras loaded with AI to give citizens ""social credit"" scores.Animal Farm was also an obvious choice to ban, given most take the children's novel as a thinly-veiled criticism of communism.Emperor's Dream surmises exposing the corruption of the Kuomintang nationalist party using puppets in an exaggerated fashion.The letter 'N'Getty - Contributor8 If you're going after literature - why not try and knock-off an entire letter?The ban on the letter now appears to be lifted, but it was temporarily blocked on Weibo after it was announced the Constitution of China would be changed to lift the limit on a two-term presidencies allowing President Xi Jinping to maintain his presidency indefinitely.It has been speculated the block on the letter was out of fear it may be used on the social media site to allude to President Jinping's terms in office in that 'n > 2'.Abnormally long beardsGAS ATROCITY FEARS US warns Syria it WILL respond after 'signs' of deadly chemical attack ME-OUCH Cat owner's face swelled & she ended up in hospital after scratch caused reaction SISTER'S DESPAIR I believe she's dead, says sister of missing Costa del Sol waitress SICK PIMP PAIR Vile couple force disabled woman, 29, to work as a £160 sex slave in shed SEALED FOR ETERNITY 1,000-year-old Buddha statue contains skeleton of 'self-mummified' monk HIT THEM WHERE IT HURTS Spy chief reveals hidden targets US can use to erase Iran threat Emigration and MigrationGetty - Contributor8 China has censored the words 'emigration', 'immigration' and the phrase 'board a plane' in an effort to quash departures from the countryA search by the China Digital Times uncovered that terms relating to emigration, migration, immigration and 'board a plane' have been banned on Weibo in an apparent move by censors to crackdown on mass emigration from China.All of these bans seem laughable, until you consider President Xi Jinpping is now allowed to remain a Chairman Mao-style “president for life” after a constitutional amendment was passed in March.We pay for your stories!

The playoffs for the league's first season, and some of the two-day grand final, were broadcast on ESPN's flagship channel on Friday night prime time, as well as being broadcast in full over on Disney XD.The main audience is still online, where millions of existing fans are already tuning in. 861,205 people tuned in every minute, on average, across the weekend--with many more there for the climax.Not one, not two, not three, but FIVE for @PROFIT_OWL and the @Spitfire in the @overwatchleague finals. pic.twitter.com/BpaP6DwyUy— ESPN (@espn) July 28, 2018Blizzard Entertainment21 Fans dressed as their favourite characters dotted the arena, along with those in replica team jerseys or other team merchAP:Associated Press21 While the arena started off really very partisan, the quality of London's play turned the neutrals aroundBlizzard Entertainment21 Hearing a sold-out arena cheer as one for a piece of perfectly executed teamwork is amazing - whatever the sportThe Barclays Arena - home to the Brooklyn Nets NBA team - was packed to the rafters for both days of the finals, selling out faster than it did for the last concert there by Kanye West.But millions watching online, in person, and on TV is just the beginning.We've built a great foundation, but are always looking for ways to improveNate NanzerOverwatch League Comissioner""We've built a great foundation, but are always looking for ways to improve,"" Nanzer says.The league, working with the game's developers, have already improved things across the course of the first season, with more changes to come. It's now much easier to follow thanks to improved spectating tools built into the game, and the team controlling the broadcasts are getting better at using those tools with every game that goes out.AP:Associated Press21 London's fans may have been in the minority, but their presence at all spoke volumes about the league's popularityBlizzard Entertainment21 The Barclays Center was sold out for both days of the event - with each featuring around two hours of in-game actionBlizzard Entertainment21 London Spitfire cheer after being awarded the trophy and being showered with confetti in team coloursBlizzard Entertainment21 Spitfire's characters, complete with their in-game uniforms - some of which may now change next year to reflect their championship winA huge focus for next season is going to be making that viewing experience better for people who have never played the game, or seen an eSports broadcast before.This is all music to the ears of the owners of the 12 current teams and potential owners of the next crop of franchises which are going to be added next year.Initial buy-in was in the region of $20 milllion per team - those wanting to add a team in the first expansion round can expect to see that rise to around $50 million.Talking to CNBC after his team's win, Spitfire CEO Jack Etienne of eSports power house Cloud 9 made it clear he'd already seen a return on his initial investment, with the franchise's value already exceeding what Cloud 9 put down for it.What is Overwatch?Overwatch is a team-based first-person shooter developed by Blizzard Entertainment.Unlike many other shooters, characters in Overwatch have one of three roles: damage-dealers, support, or tanking.Damage-dealers do the traditional job of trying to outgun the opposing team's members. Tanks are there to draw fire and soak up damage while protecting objectives or their team-mates, while support characters can heal other players, boost their damage output, or protect them.The Overwatch League is one of the flagship eSports competitions, with millions of pounds in prize money up for grabs.12 teams competed in the inaugural season: New York Excelsior, Los Angeles Valiant, Boston Uprising, Los Angeles Gladiators, London Spitfire, Philadelphia Fusion, Houston Outlaws, Seoul Dynasty, San Francisco Shock, Dallas Fuel, Florida Mayhem and the Shanghai Dragons.More are lined up for next year, with Atlanta, Paris and Guangxao confirmed and several more to follow.All the players are full-time professionals, and all the teams are currently physically based around Blizzard's Arena in Los Angeles, though there are plans afoot to move them to their respective cities with their own arenas in the next couple of years.Getty Images - Getty21 The raucous crowd seemed to love every minute of the weekend's actionBlizzard Entertainment21 T-shirts, caps, replica jerseys, stickers, keyrings, scarfs - Overwatch League teams have all the trappings you'd expect of a pro team.@Spitfire owner @jacketienne and #OverwatchLeague host @GoldenboyFTW tell us what's next for @overwatchleague and the wild world of #esports pic.twitter.com/cdE7saXsET— CNBC's Fast Money (@CNBCFastMoney) July 30, 2018Current owners include groups behind major sports teams as well as big players in the eSports world.The Philadelphia Fusion are owned by the same team that controls the Philadelphia Flyers NHL team, the Boston franchise is controlled by the Kraft family, owners of the New England Patriots NFL team.This is worlds away from the land of competitive Fortnite, the newest kid on the block. That involves online-only competitions and huge sums of prize money for individual players, but next to no organisation behind it.Asked about the threat from Fortnite and its ilk, Nanzer is almost dismissive.Blizzard Entertainment21 The attention to detail from many of the cosplayers is impressiveBlizzard Entertainment21 D-Va in her various incarnations is one of the more popular characters for cosplayersA year two decades in the making""We've been doing this for 20 years,"" says Nanzer, ""and our focus is on professionalising eSports.""Overwatch trounced Fortnite in the viewing figures online this weekend - they had 44 per cent more viewers on Twitch in terms of hours watched even though the final was less than half the length it might have been thanks to London's dominance.Fortnite grabbed the headlines with a $100million prize pool for its competitions this year, but it's drawn flak for poorly organised events, and leaves the players to fend for themselves outside of providing wads of prize money.Overwatch League's players, on the other hand, are all fully professional, are employed by their teams, and have everything from housing to healthcare and a retirement plan provided.Blizzard Entertainment21 Birdring (left) and Profit proved a deadly combination for London SpitfireBlizzard Entertainment21 Fans throughout the arena were not afraid to show their support for their favourite players and teamsBlizzard has been organising huge tournaments for its games since the launch of Starcraft back in 1998, with that game kicking off the eSports scene in South Korea where players are now mobbed like rock stars and eSports tournaments are frequently broadcast on prime time TV.They have also been creating epic fan events for just as long, with its annual Blizzcon event sitting alongside 'Invitationals' across the world that have attracted hordes of fans for years.More major sports teams are rumoured to be weighing bids for up to six expansion teams before the start of next season. The first three to go are reported to be Paris, Guangzhou and Atlanta.McCourt Global, who own Ligue 1's Olympique Marseille, are said to be in the final stages of closing a deal for Paris. The Guangzhou spot will be bought by the Nenking Group, the shell company of Chinese billionaire Zhong Naixiong that controls Chinese Basketball Association team Guangzhou Long-Lions, ESPN reports.

They should see it as an opportunity,"" Roy says.Some British teams, including runaway title winners Man City, are dabbling in eSports. City announced a major eSports partnership with headset-maker Turtle Beach yesterday and sponsors competitive FIFA players, but this should just be the start, he says.Getty Images - Getty21 Production values for the event were through the roof, with enormous screens and clever staging bringing the event to lifeBlizzard Entertainment21 London's Profit was named MVP - but the award came as much thanks to his deft co-ordination with team-mates as it did solo skillEuropean teams are already starting, but have an easier time of it as many in France and Germany in particular are already multi-sport clubs that just happen to feature a very successful football team.Roy said: “Football dominates when it comes to viewing figures but clubs cannot afford to remain complacent. The audience is aging and, increasingly, younger fans are staying away.“Clubs need to think of new and inventive ways to get people involved. It doesn’t have to be a direct link - the esports team can even exist under a different brand - but it’s about making that initial connection and having these people as fans of your organisation.“Manchester City and Paris St-Germain see value in eSports and that speaks volumes.”Blizzard Entertainment21 New York Exclesior fans were disappointed their team fell in the semi-finals, but came out in force anywayGetty Images - Getty21 Some had even adopted London by the end of the weekend MOST READ IN GAMINGBACK TO BASIC Call of Duty 'set to ditch specialists and Battle Royale for 2019 game' NEXT BOX PlayStation 5 rumours – here's what to expect from Sony's next Xbox rival HEAD START Leaked PS5 demo reveals loading times are GONE and games start in under a second BOOK ENDS GoT author writing video game that could make fans even angrier than the TV show dead good?

There was England-Brazil a few years ago and I also went on a school trip.“I remember thinking, ‘I need to play here’. That would be the ultimate goal, especially if it was an England cap.”Jamie McPhilimey - The Sun16 Page points out his latest tattoo of Wembley Stadium on the back of his calfJamie McPhilimey - The Sun16 The tattoos shows a silhouette of Page and his father walking towards WembleyPage is leaving a space below the tattoo where he hopes to one day mark the day of his England debut, while the date above the arch – July 2, 2015 in Roman numerals – was his first start at West Ham.Having joined the club at the age of nine, former manager Slaven Bilic gave Page his break in a Europa League game. This was a milestone in his journey, one he shared with his father, Martin.“He took me all over the country with football,” Page says, sat in a fold-up chair on the grass outside Charlton’s training ground.“When I signed for West Ham, he took me to every single game and he always liked to coach me as well.“On the way home, in the car, I always knew there would be a debrief but, to be fair, it’s helped me because you don’t always get it from coaches so it’s good to get it from another angle and it helps me move on.”16 Page's mum Jackie and dad Martin, who travelled the country with him while at West HamGetty - Contributor16 Page, bottom right, spent eight years at West Ham before joining Charlton last yearPA:Press Association16 Slaven Bilic gave Page his West Ham debut in the Europa LeagueMartin runs a cleaning company near the family home in Bishop’s Stortford. Page still lives with his parents, making the hour-commute to the New Eltham training base every day.But he’s currently looking at properties to move into with his girlfriend of five years, and she’s left her mark on Page in more ways than one.“That’s my girlfriend’s lips,” he says, pointing at the red tattoo on his arm.“She put some lipstick on, kissed a bit of paper and then you take it in and they stencil it onto you. That’s her exact lips.”Jamie McPhilimey - The Sun16 The kiss tattoo on Page's elbow is the print of his girlfriend's lips16 The defender has been with girlfriend Paige since they were 18Page hesitates when asked for his girlfriend’s name. Not for reasons of anonymity or protection, but because the potential for marriage provides a comical prospect.“She’s called Paige,” he says, laughing. “If we were to move onto the next step it would be Paige Page. That’s another story.”But when more of it is written, there is the possibility of more material for Page’s unfinished canvas.Asked what other tattoos he’s planning, Page says: “I’m going to wait until I have kids. Everyone’s getting these hand prints now. Have you seen them? They’re the baby handprints, so it would go well with the lips.”And how many handprints would there be?“Depends how the first one goes,” he says, again breaking into laughter. “I’d say two or three. Depends how good the first one is.”A more immediate project is to capture those closest to him in an image on the space at the top of his leg.“I’d like to get a portrait on my thigh,” he says. “Maybe a family photo, mum and dad, nan and granddad.“My granddad passed away a few months ago so I want something to do with him on there, and a framed portrait would work nicely.“I used to see him three or four days a week, he’d pick me up when mum and dad were working.”Jamie McPhilimey - The Sun16 Page is planning on adding to his art work with baby hand prints when he has childrenLATEST FOOTBALL NEWSCAP THAT Pep Guardiola wears tartan flat cap for Man City parade, and Twitter loves it Ron Mour time Cristiano hints he wants Mourinho to replace Allegri at Juventus despite past RevealedPog off Real Madrid fans vote for top transfer signings with Hazard top and Pogba last BRUTAL Ajax Cape Town starlet, 16, left for dead after being dumped in horrific assault 'Bouncebackability' Renato Sanches and Choupo-Moting go from Prem relegation to champions Quick!

Between his shoulder blades he has the word printed on a heart and dagger — but his mother, Jackie, wasn’t a fan at first.Aged 18, Page came home with the giant phoenix printed on his left shoulder.“I went big first and from then I got addicted to them,” Page says.“But mum was going to rip my head off.“Had my first one and she said, ‘What are you doing?!’ The old ‘you’re spoiling yourself’.“But most people like them — the younger generation — most people have tattoos these days.”And like many other ink-lovers, Page’s tattoos carry a message.‘Sink or swim’ is represented by a skull on his forearm; the feather between the trees means ‘write your own story’; the sign of the swallow indicates ‘living in the moment’; and the Chinese writing on his bicep translates as ‘Live. Laugh. Love.’Across his ribs, he has a poem he saw on the internet and edited a little to make more relevant to him.“It’s about having no regrets, waking up in the morning and basically doing your best,” he says.16 Page's tattoo about his family is on his back, between his shouldersJamie McPhilimey - The Sun16 The clock on Page's left arm shows the time and date he was bornJamie McPhilimey - The Sun16 Page's tattoos carry a message, including the feather which means 'write your own story'Jamie McPhilimey - The Sun16 The skull on his forearm, Page says, means 'sink or swim'There is one he doesn’t like, though.“It said, ‘live the life you love, love the life you live’ either side of a rose,” Page explains. “But I thought it didn’t look right so I put the old-school things in there again.“It was alright, I think I just grew out of it and thought it looked a bit stupid.”Wembley will not be something Page grows out of.

Fans from all over the world flocked to Newcastle for the opening week of the show, which SuBo herself appeared in for a short cameo.Susan has continued to perform and release music - proving that winning isn't everything as she has done better than many of the show's winners.However, she revealed in November 2016 that her Asperger's Syndrome, which was diagnosed in 2012-13, has made it difficult for her to perform live, and she is not sure if she will be able to tour again.Talkback Thames13 Spelbound astonished audiences with their epic routines - but it looks like the group is no moreSpelboundAcrobatic gymnasts Spelbound, who won the show in 2010, continued to perform as a group for a few years, but have since gone quiet.Spelbound were invited to perform at the London 2012 Olympics, entertaining the crowds in between competitive rounds of the rhythmic gymnastics.They also performed at the closing ceremony, when they performed The Beatles' A Day In The Life and The Kinks' Waterloo Sunset - the latter accompanying Kinks lead singer Ray Davies.As many of Spelbound's members grew out of gymnastics or left the troupe for other ventures things went quiet for the acrobats.It's not clear whether any of them are still acrobatic gymnasts, though some have gone into dance or gymnastics coaching.News Group Newspapers Ltd13 Poor Jai McDowall - Simon Cowell called him disappointing and Louis Walsh said he lacked star qualityJai McDowallScottish singer-songwriter Jai McDowall impressed the public and won the competition in 2011, performing at the Royal Variety Performance and landing himself a record deal with Simon Cowell's label Syco.But he was swiftly dropped by Cowell after his debut album, Believe, flopped, and his last notable performance was at a rally in support of Scottish independence.As if that didn't sting enough, Simon said in 2012: ""I was disappointed with last year's winner, Jai.""You want to find someone who is a star all over the world and who has got a long career. With respect to him, he wasn't one of our best ones.""While X Factor judge Louis Walsh said Jai had ""no star quality at all"".Prior to his BGT win, Jai had a brief stint on The X Factor but was dropped at bootcamp.PA:Press Association13 Ashleigh and Pudsey took home the biggest prize fund ever on BGTAshleigh and Pudsey2012 winners Ashleigh and Pudsey performed at the Royal Variety Performance and at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee after their BGT victory.The double act also won a bigger cash prize than any other BGT champion - earning themselves a tidy £500,000 when previous contestants had won just £100,000, and later winners would earn £250,000.They did a couple of pantomime roles and made a host of dog-related TV appearances together - from Top Dog Model, to That Dog Can Dance!, to Who Let the Dogs Out?Pudsey even got his own film and was voiced by Britain's Got Talent judge David Walliams.But in July 2017 it was announced that Pudsey had died after battling acute leukemia.Ashleigh has since performed with her dog Sully - renamed Pudsey.And the pair won an agility event at Crufts in March 2018.Rex Features13 Shadow theatre group Attraction did a residency in Las Vegas after winning their seriesAttractionShadow theatre group Attraction won Britain's Got Talent in 2013 despite the fact they were not from Britain at all - they are in fact Hungarian.They had already performed on the German version of Got Talent and were known in Europe - and after the show they continued to work on their international connections.Attraction landed a lucrative deal to perform their own show at The Mirage theatre in Las Vegas.They also performed on Chinese state television for Chinese New Year in 2014, recreating famous landmarks and Chinese characters with their shadow puppetry.They also performed in an insurance ad for Swinton.It's not clear whether they're still performing - but despite winning the British TV show it's clear they are not well-known in the UK any more.PA:Press Association13 Self-professed musical theatre supergroup Collabro are still releasing albumsCollabroMusical theatre supergroup Collabro won the eighth series of Britain's Got Talent in 2014.The five-piece band auditioned for the panel of judges with a rendition of a song from musical Les Miserables.Despite Simon Cowell's insistence that he HATES musical theatre, he declared ""Britain really has got talent"", and the boys haven't looked back since.Their first album, Stars, went straight to number one on the albums chart.Their second album, released in 2015, entered the charts at number 2.They have toured the UK twice, as well as in Japan, Canada and the US.Their first UK tour sold 50,000 tickets and included a sold-out show at the prestigious London Palladium theatre.However, it hasn't been all bright lights and happiness for the group.In 2016, five became four when Richard Hadfield quit the band.But they have continued to release music as a four-piece group and brought out a third album, Home, in March 2017, on a record label they set up themselves.They toured the UK at the end of 2017.Splash News13 Jules O'Dwyer and MatisseJules O'Dwyer and MatisseBritain's Got Talent viewers love a dog act, so Jules O'Dwyer and her well-trained pup Matisse were propelled to victory in 2015 - but controversy was quick to follow.TV regulator Ofcom received over 200 complaints after it emerged Matisse was not the only dog who had performed in their act - Jules' other dog, Chase, also performed in the live final of the show, but viewers were not told.No formal action was taken against the act and they still performed in the Royal Variety Performance, although some irate BGT fans said they didn't deserve the title.It's not clear whether they are still performing.Splash News13 Magician Richard Jones is still on prime time a year on - which is no mean featRichard JonesRichard is still a recognisable name a year on from winning the 2016 show.Lance Corporal and amazing magician Richard Jones wowed audiences and the judges with his mind-boggling feats, culminating in a heart-warming performance in the show's live final, when he told a veteran's life story through card tricks.MORE BGTUNRAVELLING THE MIS-TEEQ Alesha Dixon's life and career from Mis-Teeq to BGT SPEECHLESS COMEDY Get to know Lost Voice Guy, the winner of Britain's Got Talent 2018 BRITAIN'S GOT TICKETS We reveal how you can get tickets to the live finals of ITV's BGT NO HOLDEN BACK You probably know her from BGT, but what else has Amanda Holden done?

If I train at the level I need to be at, I could play for some time, maybe around seven years. I just need to be given a chance.AFP or licensors11 'Usain I can't play?'...the sprint legend takes a tumble as he trains with Norwegian club Stromsgodset“I’d have to do different workouts but I’m used to a physical challenge, so it wouldn’t be a problem.”If any scouts or managers are reading this, Usain sees himself as a left winger — with pace to burn, obviously — and an eye for goal.Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho’s claim that he would make a better left back makes him shudder.Ability-wise, Usain believes he is Premier League level, but would not be averse to turning out for a Championship club.Getty - Contributor11 True colours...Usain shows fans his number 9.63 Man Utd shirt at Old Trafford in 2012For those concerned about whether he would be able to handle being targeted by football hardmen eager to put in a reducer tackle in early on, he can handle himself.Usain said: “I’m used to being fouled. Because I’ve always been fast, you get players trying to take you out before you get going.“I’m not that type of player, but if I need to get rough I will. I’m 6ft 5in and physical, so I can do that.”Usain also claims to have plenty of leadership skills, which he will be showing off on June 10 as captain of a World XI that takes on England at Old Trafford for charity’s Soccer Aid 2018.REUTERS11 Fast feet...Usain trains with the German team Borussia DortmundHis team features a mix of celebrities and former pros, including United legend Eric Cantona, who returns to the stadium where he became a Premier League great.But Usain has no room for sentiment and is happy to bark orders at the Frenchman if he is not giving his all.He said: “You have to be a strong captain and I’m a winner, so I’m always going to push and motivate my teammates.

So what’s his secret?He said: “You have to figure out what drink doesn’t give you hangovers.“Cognac doesn’t bother me but I don’t overdo it. You’ve got to be smart. You can’t go out and drink loads every night, that doesn’t make sense.”Were he not in training for his Premier League future, Usain could throw his athlete’s diet out of the window and indulge more in his “guilty pleasure”, KFC.Rex Features11 Don't Bolt your drink...complete with lederhosen, Usain enjoys a few beers at last year's Munich OktoberfestA portion of wings and a three-piece of spicy chicken is his usual — although he switched allegiance at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and claimed to have put away 1,000 Chicken McNuggets over ten days.He had no trouble burning off the 5,000 daily calories as he tore up the track on his way to three golds. He was stripped of his relay gold last year after one of his teammates tested positive for a banned substance.If his football dream does not work out, acting is another option.

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.AFP or licensors7 It is thought that Prince Harry has yet to meet his father in lawNo matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?The complete timeline of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's relationshipI doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.Tim Stewart7 Meghan will be walked down the aisle by her dad Thomas Markle SrBut Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Her father, thrust into the brightest of all spotlights, is an important part of her story. And I don’t believe the royal wedding will be a “nightmare” for Thomas Markle.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.Ball gamesIT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.But when the streets of London have turned into killing fields, maybe the Mayor should be thinking about something other than ball games.StringfellowsWITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.Alamy Live News7 Female soldiers march during a Victory Day military parade marking the 73rd anniversary of the victory over Nazi GermanyWhat a buffoonWHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. You miss the point here, EmLABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.7 Has Ms Emily Thorberry gone over-the-top with her latest remarks?“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.Totally dementedED MILIBAND looked totally demented as he ranted and raved because MPs voted in favour of a free and independent press.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.Sir Alf is still no1SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.Hulton Archive - Getty7 Sir Alf led us to success in 1966The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.MOST READ IN OPINIONCommentJANE MOORE Time for something completely different…let's put the boot in at EU elections CommentDAMIAN GREEN How Tory leadership race can lead to every Brit having a shot at the good life CommentALLY ROSS Graham Norton shouldn't have spared Madge's blushes as he lashed Eurovision acts CommentTHE SUN SAYS Hipster who threw MILKSHAKE achieved nothing but to recruit more Farage fans CommentTREVOR KAVANAGH Vote for Nigel Farage's Brexit Party this week before BoJo zips into No10 CommentNICK TIMOTHY Tinderbox Tories will get burned at the ballots - they need a new plan All religions should be this tolerantSplash News7 Rosie Huntington-Whiteley looked fabulousTHE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.Many prominent Roman Catholics, from actor James Woods to Piers Morgan, said that the organisers would not have dared to mock any non-Christian religion. “What if it had been an Islamic theme?” asked Piers. “Or with a Jewish theme, all hell would be breaking loose.”It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.Having the choiceBRITISH scientist Dr David Goodall, 104, ended his life at a Swiss suicide clinic.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice.

But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966. Second-hand editions go for anything from £10 for a fake to £10,000 for the real thing.But to me, that programme is priceless."

Have you found a dress yet?Nope, not yet. I always thought I’d want a huge princess dress, but maybe because I’m 31 I’ll go for something more elegant. But not too simple!You and your manager Meri Sopanen, 28, are planning to marry in August. Are you all organised?We know we want to get married, but we haven’t had time to plan it. I don’t stress and I feel the wedding is a celebration of love. It can be big, but needs a cosy feeling.5 Saara hasn't had time to plan her wedding to Meri yetHow did you and Meri meet?I came second on The Voice Of Finland in 2012, and Meri sent me a message on Facebook because she felt some kind of spiritual connection. When I saw her message, there was something – it was deep – and I wrote back. That was it, until a year later when she came to one of my concerts. We started talking and never stopped. Who asked who out?I think it was me who said: “Do you want to come and have a cup of tea at my place?” We spent 12 hours together and it was the easiest thing. We were laughing and talking and couldn’t get enough of each other. We were taking it slowly, but after a year we realised there was no way we could be without each other.5 Saara Alto and her fiance Meri SopanenHow did Meri propose to you?It was a total surprise. It was our second anniversary in August 2016 and we were at home. I’d washed my make-up off and had pyjamas on. We were on the sofa and the first thing I said was: “Why are you doing this now? I don’t even have my make-up on!” And she said: “This is very special for us because we are never at home and you’re natural and yourself, and that’s how I love you.”You came second on UK X Factor in 2016. What made you enter?It’s always been my dream to sing for Simon Cowell, plus I wanted to get out of Finland. There, you have to be very normal, and I was an outsider and just didn’t fit in. When I came here, everyone said: “We love your style, let’s be flamboyant, let’s do epic things, let’s dance and have a big show.” It was the dream and it blew my mind.5 It was a total surprise when girlfriend Meri proposed to SaaraYou’re doing Eurovision next weekend for Finland. How are you feeling about it?Finland is dark and grey, but I’m a very happy, colourful, positive person – and I feel like Eurovision is all about that. Aged 10, I saw Dana International win and thought: “I should be there.” What’s been your most memorable Eurovision moment?When Conchita Wurst won [in 2014]. It showed that the world is ready for everybody. It was a historic moment. What do you love about the show?It’s so versatile. I love that music will bring people together, because the world is full of negativity. Eurovision is so positive. – Vote for Saara Aalto’s Monsters on Eurovision next Saturday. BTWSaara speaks Finnish and English fluently and “manages” in Swedish, French, Chinese and Japanese.Our shoot gave Saara some inspo and she’s now considering wearing a veil.Saara is touring with Steps soon.Words: Laura Bond  Photography: Tessa Hallmann, Flynet  Thanks to Monsoon (Monsoon.co.uk)  "

Well, it could be doing you more harm than good, especially if you’re prone to breakouts.“An exfoliating scrub will only tackle the build-up of dead skin cells and grime at a surface level,” says Anna Persaud, CEO of This Works.7 This Works Evening Detox Spray-On Exfoliant can help you break your scrubbing habits which can harm your skin“However, liquid exfoliants can penetrate deep into the epidermis to soften and resurface the top layers of skin, remove and loosen dead skin cells and decongest pores.”Break the scrub habit and reach for This Works Evening Detox Spray-On Exfoliant, £28. Spritz on to a cotton pad and wipe over your face after cleansing – no need to rinse.It contains natural protease enzymes, which sweep away dead skin cells and pollution, while the salicylic acid and witch hazel help treat blemishes and target excess sebum.Give yourself a boostSay hello to “boosters”, which are like a glass of healthy green juice for your complexion. Designed to deal with immediate skin issues, these powerful drops can be applied a few times a week instead of or before serum (which aims to prevent future skin issues, such as fine lines and repair past problems).7 Kiehl’s Since 1851 Powerful-Strength Line-Reducing Concentrate is enriched with vitamin C and will help lift dull complexion“Boosters provide a concentrated dose of active ingredients targeted for specific concerns such as dehydration or pigmentation,” explains Dr Alexis Granite, Kiehl’s Since 1851’s consulting dermatologist.Dry, flaky skin? Look for a product that contains hyaluronic acid, like Vichy Minéral 89 Skin Booster, £16.50.A vitamin C-rich product such as Kiehl’s Since 1851 Powerful-Strength Line-Reducing Concentrate, £49.50, will lift a dull complexion.Uneven texture? Opt for Time Bomb ABC Vitamin Solution, £48. It contains vitamins A, B3, B12 and C, as well as antioxidant Bakuchiol to kick-start cell renewal, fight redness and smooth skin.Pep up your peepersThe skin around the eyes is the thinnest on your whole body, making it the most delicate and prone to damage – hence those pesky crow’s feet.However, if your eyes get puffier after using an eye cream, it might be time to swap to a serum.7 Romilly's Wilde Eye Believe Serum may be on the pricey side but will soothe, brighten and firm your eye area“Eye serum can be more potent than a cream, because it contains more active ingredients,” explains Michaella Bolder, Time Bomb’s skincare expert.“Plus, they have smaller molecules, so hydrate at a deeper level, whereas creams tend to be thicker and lie in the eye socket, blocking the pores.”Apply a pea-sized amount of Hylamide SubQ Eyes Advanced Serum, £27, twice a day – it has flavanoid glucoside bio-active, which instantly gets to work on dark circles and puffiness.Romilly Wilde Eye Believe Serum, £75, might be a bit of a budget stretch, but it contains sea chamomile, pomegranate and Chinese hibiscus to soothe the eye area while also brightening and firming.Set the toneIf you ditched toners years ago, get ready to reintroduce yourself. The latest batch of toning products are a million miles away from the alcohol-based drying solutions of the past, and today’s tonic formulas have a serious role to play in your skincare regime.“These acid solutions work to smooth and brighten, but also reduce oiliness without the need to physically scrub away at our skin – leaving a smooth, glowing canvas for better absorption of your serum or moisturiser,” says Michaella.7 Glossier's Solution Exfoliating Skin Perfector is perfect for shedding your dead skin and reducing blemishesWe love Glossier Solution Exfoliating Skin Perfector, £19, which contains salicylic acid togently dissolve dead skin cells and combat blemishes.Want extra glow points? Opt for Ren Ready Steady Glow Daily AHA Tonic, £25, which uses azelaic acid to brighten and even out your complexion. A few pumps on to a cotton pad once a day will seriously transform your skin.But don’t underestimate the strength of these products. “Acid toners can significantly increase your risk of redness, dryness and irritation – in which case you need to stop using the product,” warns Michaella.“They can also increase sun sensitivity, so be sure to protect skin with an SPF. It’s best to use a minimum of SPF15, depending on your skin type, every day.”Be well gelDo you and your pillow find night creams too heavy? Traditional creams can be too greasy for some skin types, preventing absorption.“Heavy night creams can suffocate the surface layer of skin, preventing the turnover of cells overnight and resulting in breakouts come morning,” says Michaella.7 Garnier's budget-friendly Moisture Bomb will penetrate deep into your skin and help to brighten, tone and tighten7 Lancôme Visionnaire Nuit Beauty Sleep Perfector's may be expensive but it will naturally help and encourage your skin to repair itselfMOST READ IN FABULOUSFEELING BLUE Woman turns into Smurf when bath bomb dyed her skin blue after just 5 minutes ALL ABOUT THAT BASE Acne sufferers praise £9 foundation for covering cystic spots & redness GUNGE PLUNGE Woman felt like 'Shrek’ when Lush bath bomb transforms her tub into a ‘swamp’ GO BANANAS Shoppers go wild for 99p banana shampoo saying it’s the dupe of Body Shop one READY, SET, GLOW Budget beauty buys to help you prepare for a scorcher of a Bank Holiday BABY FACED Friends blast mum for wearing a full face of make-up days after giving birth “The power of a night cream comes from its ingredients, not its consistency, so a lighter, gel-based night moisturiser is ideal.”Slather on Garnier SkinActive Moisture Bomb Super-Recharging Antioxidant Gel-Cream Night, £7.99, before bed as it’s been proven to penetrate up to 10 layers of skin, allowing its superfruit ingredient – amla – to get deep into your epidermis to brighten, tone and tighten from within.Need an intense hit? Try Lancôme Visionnaire Nuit Beauty Sleep Perfector, £63.It goes on as a gel, then turns into an oil, yet still feels light on the skin. Plus rosa canina fruit oil helps to soften and encourage skin’s natural nightly repair cycle.

TEN OF CUPS. You really, really REALLY thought this person was The One, at the time.It was hearts and flowers and promises forever and forever blah blah… and then it all ended. Fond memories and a lingering affection remain. Perhaps this person was the first to show you what a good relationship could look like.The ‘energy’? SIX OF SWORDS. It has taken you both a while to truly leave it all behind and not dwell on ‘what could have been’.But move on you have, as the Six of Swords indicates, and to bigger and better-suited prospects. The split was painful, and the aftermath required emotional SOS, but you have proved you can survive that.The ‘what should you do- if anything’? THE EMPEROR. Take confidence that you’ve been tested in love, and not found wanting. You didn’t crumble beneath the weight of disappointment or regret, you carried on and you’ve done good.The life lesson! SIX OF WANDS. High five, Aries! You’re exactly where you’re meant to be- wherever that is.Life has brought you to this very spot for a good reason- the Six of Wands says so and congratulates you on the story so far.All of your past experiences are valuable and have made you who you are- don’t regret a single thing, and don’t look back. Eyes front!TaurusA loss which hit hard12The ‘who’? FOUR OF WANDS. A hard working, lively and exuberant character who you thought you were ‘going places’ with; they looked like someone with a bright future, and you felt you’d like to share those prospects.They excited you and you, in a way, held onto their coat-tails a bit.The ‘energy’? TEN OF SWORDS. And then what a shit they turned out to be. Seriously.This ended badly, and probably ranks in the top 3 Worst Experiences you’ve faced.The ‘what should you do- if anything’? FIVE OF COINS. Even though you know they were not right for you, nor were you suited, nor would you ever, like ever, go back... there’s still a feeling of loss around this one.The good times were GOOD, and you had high hopes.You felt ‘lacking’ because of how they treated you, and that horrible, sticky emotion has remained with you on some level (‘am I good enough?’).The life lesson! KING OF COINS. This ‘lacking’ energy has outlived its lifespan, I mean it!King of Coins is the resilient, tough-nut, survivor card; he is here to rag-doll you out of this false self belief that people ‘can do better’ than you.They can’t. You are awesome, and this d**k from the past was the loser- not you. Put it firmly behind you.GeminiRevisit your pursuit of the ‘unavailable’12The ‘who’? FIVE OF COINS. A mean, moody Earth sign (Capricorn, Virgo, Taurus) who was not really into you, but just filling up their own void of loneliness and lack at the time (that sounds horrible, doesn’t it, but this was a long time ago- you can face the hard truths now, you’re a toughie).The ‘energy’? THE WORLD. They had already moved past you before they’d even started up with you, really. Their mind and attention was on other things, beyond your relationship. The World card suggests it’s possible they moved away not long afterwards, or had a massive life change.The ‘what should you do- if anything’? THE HERMIT. This is definitely an Ex to keep a lid on, entitled ‘CASE CLOSED’, however, The Hermit asks you seriously whether there is some contemplation to be done about how you got so deep into something so shallow...The life lesson! THE DEVIL. … because the life lesson shown by The Devil represents bad habits, and repeat patterns which don’t do us any favours. Have you pursued unavailable people in general?Do you think you respond better to indifference than interest? Geminis are fickle, and their desires often disguised. This distance from emotion can get them into dead ends romantically.Have a ponder about your ‘default’ attractions. Perhaps a reboot is in order.CancerGuess who’s (maybe) back12The ‘who’? QUEEN OF COINS. You really liked and admired this person, and felt ‘safe’ with them.They were hard working, practical, ambitious and driven- all of which you respected. It felt like maybe your first ‘grown up’ relationship. Albeit one where the passion was not a ‘10’.The ‘energy’? QUEEN OF CUPS. Emotions ran high. The Queen of Cups is attuned to her feelings, but can go off the handle if riled or mishandled. Perhaps your expectations of each other were misaligned, or the feelings were too intense, but the end result was an infamous Cancerian river of tears.The ‘what should you do- if anything’? KNIGHT OF WANDS. You know what: this one could be back one day. You’re both older, wiser and more - dare I say - ‘stable’ these days.Your emotions have simmered down, and you know you made mistakes here. One little adventure could reignite this spark.The life lesson! SEVEN OF SWORDS. Keep your own counsel. The Seven of Swords is about guarding your own interests and watching your back.Perhaps, before, you were so confused that you (over)shared everything about this romance with friends / family. The advice you received was well-meant, but it inevitably distorted your view and behaviour.In future, trust your own instincts. What are they telling you now?LeoA holiday romance (with potential)12The ‘who’? FOUR OF SWORDS. A holiday romance, I think, or a summer fling- as the Four of Swords denotes vacations and rest.Someone who you really just chilled out with, and had fun. They were taking a ‘time out’ from life and you were on the same page.The ‘energy’? THE SUN. It was summer, it was sunny, the birds were singing, the bees were buzzing. There’s almost a lyrical and poetical tinge to these memories.It was a happy time and didn’t end badly, as such, but just ran its natural course (although, in your mind, there was room for an Epilogue…).The ‘what should you do- if anything’? TWO OF SWORDS. You’ve pondered over this one, and wondered whether it would be worth rekindling the flame. It’s doable.But something has held you back… examine what that is before you do anything.Done? OK, now you’ve identified the ‘but…’, is it still worth it?The life lesson! KING OF CUPS. You can have more than one soul mate, you know (sigh of relief, because Leos love to love!), and though this could be ‘the one who got away’, there are plenty more ones who are still ON the way!Rekindle if you will, but not because you think this was IT. There’s more love to come your way without having to reverse to Love Life Past.VirgoYou can’t force it12The ‘who’? JUDGMENT. This relationship proved a turning point for your fortunes in romance and, hereafter, you appreciated people in a different way. How this went, and how it ended, taught you something important.Judgment indicates that your self-confidence, and expectations, of relationships were reset as a result.The ‘energy’? NINE OF COINS. You thought this one had long term potential and foresaw a happy home with this person.The Nine of Coins is all about the ‘long game’ and maybe you were so focussed on the future prospects, you forgot you weren’t really that happy in the here and now. It was always ‘if only we did this...’The ‘what should you do- if anything’? TEN OF SWORDS. Game is firmly over here, with no benefit from revisiting the whys and wherefores. Shut the door, and breathe a sigh of relief that you got out of that sitch.The life lesson! PAGE OF CUPS. Happiness is in the here and now, the moments we’re laughing and smiling during each day. It can’t be planned for, postponed or organised into existence, and because this one looked good ‘on paper’ you tried so hard to make it work. It just didn’t. You stayed too long.LibraLet’s go round again?12The ‘who’? STRENGTH. The passion-o-meter hit the WOWZER zone with this one. It sizzled from the start and you’ve never forgotten that chemistry. Nor have they.The ‘energy’? FIVE OF COINS. Where did it all go wrong??? Because it really did, and it really shouldn’t have done. And, when it did, you were inconsolable; it felt like the end of the world. You lost more than just a lover, you felt bereft in other ways too. God, it was awful.The ‘what should you do- if anything’? TWO OF CUPS. I hate to say this, I do, but this one had potential. The Two of Cups is the tarot’s ‘happy love life’ card, showing a mutually beneficial pairing where the individuals are more together than either could be alone. It’s a winner.The life lesson! QUEEN OF COINS. If you want it, go get it. The Queen of Coins doesn’t mess about; she is a pragmatic go-getter who is loved, respected and admired. This Ex wouldn’t scoff at your advances, at the very worst it’d be an interesting conversation. At best, BADA BING!ScorpioThings have changed12The ‘who’? THE HANGED MAN. Ugh, one of those forever on-off jobs, which can drag on for years and never really get anywhere. This one had potential, sometimes it went well… but, mostly, overall, it became a damp squib.The ‘energy’? TEN OF COINS. Weirdly, the Ten of Coins turns up to suggest you are ultimately compatible. Perhaps the timing was wrong? Perhaps you were just too young to really appreciate that mental and spiritual compatibility? Perhaps circumstances intervened? Well, now you’re older and wiser and, with all that maturity, things could be different.The ‘what should you do- if anything’? ACE OF CUPS. Call him!! Gosh, I am scared to suggest this because it feels radical BUT the Ace of Cups is the ‘new relationships’ card, so it’s kinda’ like the Universe is willing this one back into existence! Dare you?The life lesson! ACE OF COINS. Just because it didn’t work before, doesn’t mean it can’t work now. Things have changed. The Ace of Coins is about small steps, which add up to a big investment in our future.So, get in touch. Don’t go overboard, be cautious, friendly and casual, make a ‘baby-step’ move and see what unfolds.SagittariusDon’t do it again!12The ‘who’? THE LOVERS. It was a good relationship, mostly, but it’s likely that you (or they) were a bit of a dick at the time. The Lovers is all about divided feelings, conflicted needs i.e. a fancy way of saying cheating. Sagittarians are notorious flirts, and can get into hot water quicker than a tea bag.The ‘energy’? THE STAR. It’s a shame, really, because you were good together. The Star is a wish-come-true card, a blessing. It can also, however, conversely point to a big disappointment, and I think that’s the emotion that lingers here. What might have been...The ‘what should you do- if anything’? DEATH. Don’t let this happen again! Whatever went awry here, examine your role in it and take ownership of your actions. There’s something here which you need to change. Either your own conflicted behaviours, or your acceptance of others’ dickery. Look at this honestly.The life lesson! QUEEN OF COINS. Stability IS important. Your thirst for adventure is legendary, and sometimes this can cause issues. Remember where this one went wrong, and the role you played, and be vigilant for those urges or habits arising again- mark them on your radar and guard against their presence. You’ll be so much happier.CapricornMaybe you can be friends12The ‘who’? QUEEN OF CUPS. You were very young, and very much in love and so were they. Maybe a teen dream, a school romance, a first love. Fondness, nostalgia and those teenesque heightened emotions and promises colour this memory with a bright, happy dayz tinge.The ‘energy’? PAGE OF SWORDS. For all its intensity, it wasn’t REALLY serious. It couldn’t have been, because you were too young to take it anywhere, and life got busy and more demanding and other opportunities arose… and you both moved on to other things.The ‘what should you do- if anything’? SIX OF CUPS. There’s nothing ‘lurking’ here to address. It’s a happy memory which makes you smile, and so it should.And, now that enough time has passed, it’s possible you could rekindle a friendship. Nothing heavy- just a chance to relive some memories that only you two share.The life lesson! THE STAR. Not every love leads to ‘together forever’ but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t a wish-come-true at the time, nor that it’s not been a valuable part of your life.Appreciate this for what it is, and wish each other well.AquariusYou learned what you DON’T want12The ‘who’? FIVE OF WANDS. Oh, the rows, the endless tension and frantic bickering- god, it was exhausting and- though you like a challenge- this was all a bit too much. They were just too much.The ‘energy’? THREE OF COINS. They were on at you all the time, expecting more, demanding their needs be met, throwing disappointment and sulky shade your way if not. You felt, in the end, that you were walking on eggshells, and that you were merely there to make them happy. What about you?The ‘what should you do- if anything’? PAGE OF CUPS. Through this toxic pairing, you discovered how much you need the gentle, creative and social energy of the Page of Cups. A partner for you has to be fun, adventurous and loose on the reins. You need space, you’ve learnt that the hard way.The life lesson! TEN OF SWORDS. This card means THE END, GOOD RIDDANCE, NEVER AGAIN. And that’s that really. Let’s move on.PiscesThere’s life left in this12The ‘who’? NINE OF CUPS. Oh, this was one of those where you had fancied them for AGES. The crushing went on for some time, and you daydreamed about them constantly, and were then miraculously rewarded with their genuine attention and affection. You were on cloud 9.The ‘energy’? THE STAR. It was lovely, it was dreamy, it was a golden era... and the disappointment you felt when it was over has lingered ever since.The ‘what should you do- if anything’? KNIGHT OF CUPS. There’s still life in this one. The Knight of Cups is the tarot’s charmer, the lover who sweeps you off your feet. It might not necessarily last the course… but it could be worth a spin out. A grand gesture is what’s required, if you’re up for it.The life lesson! SEVEN OF WANDS. Did this end because of some competition or rivalry, or jealousy? This card represents those attributes and they can really spoil something good.You know better now. Appreciate what you have and trust it’s yours; guard against the sabotaging need to snoop, spy or cling too tightly. You’re either what they want, or not. And you’re still awesome either way. Want to know more?

Except he wasn’t quite paying the full amount.Instead he borrowed €340m from high-interest hedge fund Elliott Management in order to push through the sale and used a further €300m in offshore assets, stumping up just €100m in cash.There were always doubts about the long-term viability of borrowing from Elliott, but those fears appear to have been realised with new reports in Corriere della Sera claiming Li is bankrupt.EPA4 Chinese businessman Yonghong Li took over AC Milan amid dreams of the Serie A giants conquering Europe againAFP4 AC Milan owner Yonghong Li, pictured (right) with predecessor Silvio Berlusconi, faces big money problemsWhat does that mean for Li and Milan? Our friends at Football Whispers attempt to get to the bottom of a sorry mess.They say the grass isn’t always greener. But after the glory days of Berlusconi’s reign in the 80s and 90s, success has dried up in recent decades. DOPE SHOCK West Ham charged with anti-doping rule breach by the Football AssociationTheir 2011 title win, delivered by current Juventus coach Max Allegri, was the Rossoneri’s last. Milan, a club synonymous with European success under Berlusconi, haven't been in the Champions League since 2014.Fresh impetus was needed and, despite fears over how Li was financing the deal, the takeover offered that.Li quickly endeared himself to the club’s supporters, splashing €188m on seven new players while Gianluigi Donnarumma – a Real Madrid transfer target – signed a new deal to keep him at San Siro.However, despite all the signs of encouragement, there were fears that it could all collapse.The money lent by Elliott would be due back, with interest, and Milan would realistically need to return to the Champions League or sell star names to meet the repayments.Italy’s top four teams qualify for Europe’s elite club competition.Milan are seventh, as many points away from fierce rivals Inter who occupy the final Champions League qualification spot.Head coach Vincenzo Montella was dismissed at the end of November with the gap between Milan and the holy grail widening by the week.CLAIM YOUR FREE £30 BET Check out this new sign up offer from Sun BetsWilfried Zaha steps up training as he hopes for comeback for Crystal Palace Clearly concerned they would not make the top four, Milan sough to refinance their loan from Elliott.It’s a nightmare scenario.Now reports in Corriere della Sera say the 48-year-old is bankrupt and his assets will be auctioned off on Taobao, the Chinese equivalent of eBay.Furthermore, he is being sued by two Chinese banks: Jiangsu and Canton.There are even reports Li was insolvent before he took control of Milan in April 2017.Former Milan CEO Adriano Galliani refutes those claims, however. “Yonghong Li invested €740m to buy Milan,” Galliani told Mattino Cinque.Getty Images - Getty4 Milan have slipped to seventh in Serie A - eight points behind fourth-placed Lazio“We were assisted by a very important advisor and a famous law firm, as was Yonghong Li. Not only did he buy Milan, but another three important things happened.“First of all, he presented the credentials to the Lega Calcio and was approved. Secondly, the Elliott fund loaned Mr Li over €300m, so they must’ve made their own evaluations. Mauro Icardi doused with flour by Inter Milan team-mates in Jackass-style prank after training“Finally, over the summer a transfer campaign worth €200m was completed, giving all the necessary financial guarantees and bank bonds that the Italian rules demand.“I don’t know the reality of what is happening in China, but one plus one plus one makes three, so that’s how things have gone so far.”So what does it all mean for Milan, one of Europe’s grandest old clubs? For now that is unclear.Li’s tenure has been scrutinised from the outset.How can Chelsea stop Lionel Messi and Barcelona in the Champions LeagueIn January he released a strongly worded statement refuting claims by Italian newspapers La Stampa and Il Secolo XIX relating to alleged money laundering.But actions speak louder than words. The auction has been postponed from February 2 already and little will be determined until – or unless – it goes ahead.It is not clear whether Milan would even come under Li’s assets as the club is owned by Sino-Europe Sports, a holding company in which the businessman owns a stake. How much is again unclear.Alamy Live News4 Previous Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi oversaw many domestic and European titlesmost read in footballExclusivegea change Man Utd under pressure to sell David De Gea after star man rejects 'best offer' Live BlogSOL SEARCHING Get the latest updates from Old Trafford as Ole plots summer overhaul Live BlogGUNNER sign?

124,Theresa May forced to rule out customs union with the EU after Brexiteers threatened walk-out,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5499601/theresa-may-rules-out-eu-customs-union/,"4th February 2018, 10:30 pm","THERESA May was last night forced to rule out any form of customs union with the EU after Tory Brexiteers threatened a mass walk-out.The PM had even been warned of a formal split in the Conservative party if she opted to keep Britain tied to the EU’s trading rules, which would bar us from striking new trade deals.Getty - Contributor6 The PM was forced to make an announcement after Brexiteers threatened a walkoutMaking the warning very clear to Mrs May, a senior Tory MP told The Sun : “If they go for a customs union, the party will split.”It followed other warnings from Brexiteers that the PM would face a “cavalry” of opposition from her party if she chose to keep Britain in a customs union with Brussels.According to the Sunday Times Tory MPs also threatened to stage a coup if she rejected their calls.They warned that doing so would see her replaced with a Brexit “dream team” of Boris Johnson as PM, Michael Gove as deputy PM and Jacob Rees-Mogg as Chancellor. Jacob Rees-Mogg is the bookie's favourite to replace the PMBut in a significant move last night ahead of a crucial week of Brexit meetings, a Downing Street source said: “It is not our policy to stay in a Customs Union.”Instead the PM will propose two options: a customs partnership or a “highly streamlined customs arrangement.”It is the first time that No10 has categorically ruled out the prospect of Britain being part of any customs union with the EU after Brexit.It comes amid reports that members of Mrs May's 'war cabinet' believe some kind of compromise could still be struck in a bid to end the rift.Ministers are said to be drawing up secret plans to ask Brexiteers to sign up to a time-limited extension to parts of the existing customs union, The Times reports.This could allow trade deals with non-EU nations if short-term economic harm could be avoided.Some in Downing Street believe this could drive a wedge between Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.A senior member of government told the paper No 10 was prepared to play them off against each other by doing 'what any good leader does: divide and rule'.What is the EU customs union?BEING a part of it is one of the founding treaties binding members of the EU, and is a central part of the bloc’s trade policy:It means they can all trade freely with each other at no cost, and agree to charge the same tariff on imports from countries outside it.But staying inside the EU Customs Union means it is tied to its arrangements with the rest of the world.This means the UK cannot negotiate its own trade deals with counties like India and China – one of the key issues for Brexiteers.Leaving it would also mean Britain would not have to continue to pay contributions to Brussels - in 2015 it paid £13billion.It would also be able to ditch free movement rule and take back control of immigration, and not be subject to European Court of Justice laws.But those who want us to stay in say the UK will face tariffs to sell our goods and services with our biggest trading partner the EU.And maintaining membership means the soft border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland can continue, and not go back to having customs checks.Getty Images - Getty6 Theresa May is set to host a lunch alongside David DavisIt comes ahead of a crucial week for the PM on Brexit. Tomorrow she will host a working lunch in No10 with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and her own Brexit chief David Davis.She will then finally hammer out her Brexit blueprint when she convenes her Brexit “war cabinet” on Wednesday and Thursday. They will meet for two hours on both days for showdown talks between ministers such as Philip Hammond and Amber Rudd who favour a softer Brexit opposite Boris Johnson and Michael Gove who will argue in favour of a clean break from Brussels rules.Yesterday Ms Rudd, the Home Secretary, insisted ministers won’t be intimidated by threats from Tory Brexiteers - and said she was confident the Cabinet’s Brexit sub-committee will reach an agreement.She told the Andrew Marr Show: “I have a surprise for the Brexiteers, which is the committee that meets in order to help make these decisions is more united than they think.“We meet in the committee. We meet privately for discussions. I think that we will arrive at something which suits us all.JEFF OVERS6 Amber Rudd favours a softer Brexit“There will be choices to be made within that, but we all want the same thing which is to arrive at a deal which works for the UK.”She said Mrs May had an “open mind” as to how to reach a deal that delivers “frictionless” trade at the border.But minutes later the housing minister Dominic Raab, a prominent member of the Vote Leave campaign, said anything that looks like a customs union will not get the support of Tory Brexiteers.Putting pressure on the PM, he told ITV’s Peston on Sunday show: “I don’t think we will be in any form - at least conceived in international trade practice - of customs union. Mrs May held trade talks with Chinese officials earlier this week“Because if we were we would have our hands tied in negotiating free trade deals with other parties, whether that is Brazil, China or India.“The Prime Minister has been very clear we want to be able to grasp those opportunities.”Attempting to draw a line under the row last night, a Downing Street source said: “To put this to rest, we are categorically leaving the Custom Union. At home, Brexit is about taking back control of our money, laws and borders. We are going to deliver that.""But Brexit is also about the freedom to strike out into the world and sign our own trade deals. We want a good, deep trade deal with the EU and customs arrangement which are as frictionless as possible.PA:Press Association6 Dominic Raab said any sort of customs union would lose the support to BrexiteersBut we must also be free to sign those trade deals with the rest of the world. We have brilliant companies in the UK and we want to strengthen their opportunities to export. We would not want to do something that limits those opportunities.So it is not our policy to stay in the Customs Union. It is not our policy to stay in a Customs Union.Our policy was set out very clearly in the summer in our customs future partnership paper: we are proposing either of two models - a customs partnership or a highly streamlined customs arrangement.

""But I think there is more that we could be doing in the interim and doing right now"".The two countries have agreed to lift a ban on British beef exports to China within six months, Mrs May confirmed, and said that they were exploring new ways of pushing Britain's world-leading financial services firms to reach more Chinese consumers.Mrs May also revealed that she is working closely together with Chinese leaders to stop ""reckless"" North Korea attacking the world with nukes.And she admitted there was more to do to make sure that people can ""achieve the British dream of ensuring that each generation has a better future than the last.""British beef back on the menu in China, PM revealsBRITISH beef is going back on the menu in China for the first time since the BSE crisis  erupted 20 years ago, Theresa May revealed today.In a deal worth up to £500 million to British farmers,  Mrs May said China was opening the door to beef and dairy exports from the UK.The first shipments could head to the Far East in July.China's de-facto deputy president Li Keqiang said Beijing wanted to give the country's burgeoning middle class  the opportunity to buy ""higher quality"" cuts.Speaking alongside Premier Li, the PM said: ""We have agreed new measures to improve market access in China and remove barriers to trade.""This includes an agreement to make progress on the lifting of the BSE ban on British beef exports within six months and an agreement to allow exports of a broader range of dairy products from the UK to China.”British beef and veal exports leapt 45 per cent to countries outside Europe in the first half of 2017 - but the shipments were worth just £23 million.The European Union slapped a global ban on British beef exports in 1996 after the outbreak of ""Mad Cow"" disease.Both Japan and the US have recently vowed to lift the ban.Downing Street said the lifting of restrictions on beef and dairy products could be worth as much as £500 million in five years.Prime Minister Theresa May hails golden era of China relations in trade tripThe Chinese rolled out the red carpet for her upon her arrival - and she was presented with two huge bunches of flowers as soon as she got off the plane last night.Today Theresa May inspected troops at the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square on arrival in China's capital. A military band greeted her with a rendition of God Save the Queen.She visited Wuhan University to meet students at a UK-China Spirit of Youth festival. Wuhan - two hours from Beijing - has the highest student population of any city in the world.The PM was greeted by famous Chinese actress Jiang Shu-Ying, who studied at the University of East Anglia and is an ambassador for the scheme, as well as the Communist Party secretary of Hubei province, Jiang Chaoliang.More than 200 Chinese students of English and young Britons studying in Wuhan cheered and took videos on their mobile phones as Mrs May took to the stage to announce a series of new educational links between the countries.She told them: ""By learning with each other and from each other, we can continue to develop the bond of friendship on which this golden era of UK-Chinese relations is built, bringing our people together not just now but for years to come.""PA:Press Association14 Theresa May and her husband Philip arriving in China todayPA:Press Association14 She was presented with flowers upon landing in China for her first trade tripThe PM later visited the bank of the Yangtze River to view a project aimed at tackling chronic plastic pollution. The waterway carries 1.5 million tonnes of plastic into the ocean every year.Mrs May was later joined by husband Philip to watch an open-air performance of Chinese opera at Wuhan's pagoda-style Yellow Crane Tower.And she has promised not to shy away from raising human rights issues with China's leaders on the three-day trip.""I will be raising both human rights and the issue of Hong Kong,"" Mrs May told reporters travelling with her to China - which was later confirmed by the Chinese premier.She wrote in the Financial Times today that she wanted to “step up our relationship with China as it opens up its markets, spreads its prosperity and embraces free trade”.And she is keen to push the ""golden age"" of relations between the two nations - and will drum up support for a trade deal when we quit the EU.But she admitted the two nations didn’t always see “eye to eye”.""We also need to protect the rules-based approach that underpins and enables robust, sustainable, free-flowing global trade,"" she added.""All large economies have a special responsibility to show leadership on this front.""The Prime Minister will risk tension by telling them to stop flogging Chinese steel on the cheap - hurting UK firms.She will hold crunch talks with President Xi Jinping tomorrow.Getty Images - Getty14 She watched an outdoor opera perform alongside her husbandGetty Images - Getty14 The PM and her husband watch an open-air performance of Chinese opera at Wuhan's pagoda-style Yellow Crane TowerEPA14 The performance was put on the first day of her trade tripThis afternoon a No10 spokesperson indicated that they would release the leaked studies if a vote in the House of Commons expected later today gives that result.Last night Mrs May vowed MPs would be ""fully informed"" about the economic impact of Brexit before they vote on the final EU divorce deal.As a bitter row raged over the leaked impact assessments, the PM promised the Government would publish the ""appropriate analysis"" when the time comes - and the work is complete.And she echoed Brexit Minister Steve Baker by saying the leaked documents that emerged yesterday were a ""selective interpretation of a very preliminary analysis"".Mrs May was speaking on route to China as the fierce row exploded in Westminster over the gloomy impact assessment forecasting that growth could be 8 per cent lower over the next 15 years than if the UK stayed in the EU.Asked about its findings, Mrs May said: "" It would be wrong to describe this as 'the Brexit impact assessment'. There is analysis being done.""This is very preliminary. What has been seen so far is a selective interpretation of a very preliminary analysis, which ministers have not signed off, have not approved, and which doesn't actually even look at the sort of deal that we want to deliver in terms of the future relationship with the European Union.""And the PM insisted the assessment of the 'bespoke' deal she is seeking with the EU would be evaluated - and published. She said: ""When the time comes for Parliament to vote on the final deal we will ensure that Parliament has the appropriate analysis on which to be fully informed, on which to base their judgement.""Minister faces calls to quit after he questions whether Brexit should happen AT ALL if gloomy impact assessments are trueA MINISTER has questioned whether Brexit should happen AT ALL if gloomy impact assessments about our EU exit turn out to be true.Justice minister Phillip Lee said in an extraordinary Twitter rant that there would be a ""serious question"" over whether Theresa May could carry on with Brexit if it would damage the country's economy.Yesterday Brexiteers rounded to slam a leaked report suggesting Britain would be worse off out of the EU - because it didn't look at the preferred option of us getting a special deal.But Dr Lee said that the Prime Minister had a huge ""challenge"" in delivering our exit - and said that it would tricky for the Government to lead Britain down a ""damaging"" path.He wrote: ""The next phase of Brexit has to be all about the evidence. We can’t just dismiss this and move on. If there is evidence to the contrary, we need to see and consider that too.""But if these figures turn out to be anywhere near right, there would be a serious question over whether a government could legitimately lead a country along a path that the evidence and rational consideration indicate would be damaging. This shows the PM's challenge...""The PM has been dealt some tough cards and I support her mission to make the best of them. It’s time for evidence, not dogma, to show the way. We must act for our country’s best interests, not ideology & populism, or history will judge us harshly. Our country deserves no less.""And now faces calls to quit too.Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said Dr Lee should resign if he wanted to oppose the Government.He said: ""The chief whip needs to impose collective responsibility discipline across the government. If he wants to espouse his own views then he should be on the backbenches where he would be free to do so.""His comments are inaccurate. He said if there is any truth in these figures, but the fact is there is not. They will be proved wrong again.""It is an attempt to undermine Brexit minister Steve Baker’s response on behalf of the government to the urgent question yesterday.""But No10 said he would not be sacked.A Downing Street spokesman said today: “He has been spoken to by the Chief Whip and been reminded it’s best to air views in private.”​Prime Minister ​Theresa May arrives​ in China​ for a three-day trip designed to boost trade after BrexitPA:Press Association14 And the PM addressed students at Wuhan University in Hubei - where students lined up to take her photoReuters14 The Prime Minister at an event at Wuhan UniversityReuters14 The Prime Minister is on her first official China trip this weekPA:Press Association14 She discussed pollution in China too in a photo op over the Chinese Yangtze riverEPA14 Queues of Chinese people wait for a glimpse of Mrs May and the Chinese PremierMOST READ IN POLITICSExclusiveSAJ'S MIGRATION BID Sajid Javid to scrap £30,000 minimum salary threshold for EU migrants ACID THREAT Nigel Farage should have had ACID thrown on him, Labour supporter says LatestSHAKEDOWN 'Radicalised Remainer' who threw £5.25 milkshake at Farage charged with assault 'TOO LATE' Ofcom slammed for waiting until THIRD death before launching reality show probe BORIS BOMBSHELL Boris Johnson is biggest threat to Jeremy Corbyn, Labour voters fear RevealedMILK MANIAC Nigel Farage milkshake attacker is a fanatical Remainer and Corbyn fan BOO WHAT?

I’d never done anything like that — the most notable nautical thing I’d done before that was go on the Woolwich ferry.”The crew were raising cash for the Endeavour Fund, Blesma, Help for Heroes and Row2Recovery.And it was brutal going, with the crews rowing two hours on, two hours off in the day, and three hours on three hours off at night.Lee added: “It was incredibly tiring. I found the first couple of days really challenging — it was not so much the physical exertion, it was the sleep.“And it was terrifying, the waves were massive. From the word go we had a large side swell, so that was scary.”But the challenge awakened something in Lee that he thought was gone — demonstrating the inspirational power of adventure.He added: “It sounds trite that I went on a journey to discover myself, but it really was that.“It was the single most important and positive thing to happen to me.“I’m incredibly proud of being part of it, massively proud.”Overcoming adversity, sponsored by Barclays Former Snr Aircraftman LUKE WIGMAN, and ­former Captain IBI ALI, Yorkshire RegimentWOUNDED war heroes Ibi Ali and Luke Wigman conquered one of the toughest running races on the planet – the World Marathon Challenge.RAF paratrooper Luke, 31, of Nottingham, was serving with the crack Special ­Forces Support Group when he ­suffered horrific leg injuries in a bomb blast in Helmand, Afghanistan in 2011.42 The pair ran in Antarctica as part of the World Marathon ChallengeAnd decorated former Army officer Ibi, 40, from York, lost part of his right arm to a roadside bomb in Iraq in 2007.But together they ran seven marathons in seven days on seven continents to raise almost £1million for a new rehabilitation centre for injured and sick troops. Starting in Antarctica, the pair then ran consecutive 26.2mile races in Chile, Miami, Madrid, Marrakech, Dubai and Sydney in less than a week.Determined Ibi became the first amputee to complete the challenge while Luke completed the race in the third fastest time ever.They did it all for the new £300million Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre (DNRC), being completed right now in Loughborough, Leics, ready to open next October.42 The two raised almost £1million by running seven marathons in seven days on seven continentsIbi said: “The DNRC is going to be epic. I don’t think people will get the full scale of it until it opens its doors.“I want to allow servicemen and women who haven’t even been born yet to have the best level of care.”In total the pair ran 183.4 miles and flew for 59 hours covering 27,000miles in a week.When they started in Antarctica an international stop clock began, ­counting down the 168 hours the ­runners had to complete the challenge.On being nominated Luke said: “We don’t do these things for a pat on the back or to boost our own ego, we do it to make a difference.“But when someone recognises you along the way, it’s an incredible feeling.”Officer Cadet PADMAJA ‘PIYA’ DAS, Royal Navy ReservesPLUCKY Reservist Das has repeatedly beaten the odds to realise her dream of serving in the Armed Forces.But the Officer Cadet, 26, of Telford, Shrops, has had to obliterate stereotypes and cultural, religious and gender barriers to make it happen.42 Reservist Padmaja beams with pride in her armed forces uniformPiya came to the UK from West Bengal aged 11 in 2002, when her dad moved here with work.It was a seismic shock. She recalled: “I had left my friends, my family and everything back in India. I could not speak English, I could not make friends. There was a lot of taunting, which changed into bullying.”She found her solace in studying.After completing GCSEs and A Levels in maths, further maths, physics and economics she achieved a BTEC in electronic engineering while working part time in Primark.While studying aerospace engineering at university she also worked night shifts at Debenhams to pay the fees.Piya then achieved a masters in the same subject and after 138 job applications was employed as a specialist instructor at the Engineering School, HMS Sultan. After multiple attempts to join the Armed Forces were thwarted by residency laws, she joined the Royal Navy Reserves.She now works at RAF Cosford training engineering officers in aerodynamics, thermodynamics and engineering mathematics.In her spare time she is an ambassador for the Royal Navy, visiting schools to promote engineering and inspire students, especially young girls.All this was made possible through her determination to follow her dreams – and serve in uniform.She said: “I am too stubborn to give up. The day I wore my uniform it was a massive glow of pride. I had earned it because I have stretched myself – the Reserves have stretched me.“When I did my passing out parade I was the most happiest person on Earth.”Best reservist nomineesCorporal PHILIP KEOGH, 355 Medical Evacuation UnitWHEN Salman Abedi detonated his suicide bomb at the Manchester Arena, paramedic Philip Keogh was on night duty miles from the city.Controllers asked him to return to Rochdale ambulance station and await further instructions as the terror attack unfolded.42 Sense of duty . . .  Philip’s instincts are to help those in needBut father-of-two Philip, 40, is also a Reservist Army medic who has treated bomb victims at Camp Bastion in ­Afghanistan.Believing his specialist military expertise would be needed, he drove his rapid response vehicle towards Manchester, where dozens of victims — many of them young girls — had been maimed.For his actions, Philip has been shortlisted for Best Reservist in the Millies.Now in their tenth year, The Sun Military Awards shine a spotlight on incredible acts of gallantry and grit.London News Pictures42 Traumatic scenes . . . the wounded after the Manchester arena bombingPhilip, a Corporal with the Manchester-based 355 Medical Evacuation Unit, says: “Before they said to go to Manchester, I was already on my way.“One of the strange memories of that ­evening for me was the drive there. My legs just felt really funny because the adrenaline was pumping.“I was thinking that maybe I could help out a little bit more because I’d been in Afghanistan and done the training, through the battle courses the military do.“One of my bosses, Dan Smith, said I should go and start doing triage in and around Victoria train station.”PA:Press Association42 In May, a homemade bomb was detonated as concert-goers were leaving Manchester ArenaBecause of the ongoing inquiry into the bombing, in which 22 people died and 250 were wounded, Philip cannot reveal too much detail about his part in the horrific events of May 22.But such was the scale of the devastation — and the extent to which emergency services were stretched — that he was soon drawing on all his military training to save lives.Despite the threat of a second bomb, he identified the injured and prioritised them for treatment.Realising that patient evacuation was becoming an issue, Philip took charge by coordinating the stretcher lift of patients.He worked tirelessly as part of a large team of rescuers to control the scene, detailing crews to undertake treatment and delivering life-saving care himself.PA:Press Association42 A tribute left to the victims in the wake of the bombingHis dedication, bravery and calm in the chaos saved numerous lives.Philip says: “I have a strong sense of duty to the community that I live with and that I work for.“I joined the reserve as a medic because I like to help people, to serve and to make a difference.“We do what we do and we do our job at great personal cost. It’s not just physical but the psychological damage we endure because we, as ordinary people doing extraordinary things, have to endure some very nasty sights.“People touched by the events in ­Manchester will always carry that scar with them. I know I will.”On being nominated for a Millie, he adds: “It’s quite humbling to be nominated for something which I feel is part of my job.“In some ways, I feel the recognition it has brought me is undeserved because it is for something that should never have happened.“Countless people, not just ambulance, fire police and civilians, played their part in the aftermath. I have never been prouder to be a Mancunian.”Lieutenant Commander IAIN BEATON, Maritime Trade Operations BranchFOUR reservists, led by Lieutenant ­Commander Beaton, play a crucial role in keeping perilous shipping routes in the Middle East safe from pirates and drug smugglers.Based in Dubai, this small but vital unit uses military and commercial information to operate a 24-hour advice service to merchant ships.42 Iain Beaton is helping to keep important shipping routes safeThe team, who have left their jobs, families and friends for the two-year posting, also coordinate rescue missions when things go wrong.Like on the evening of April 8 this year, when the master of the bulk carrier OS35 reported that his 600ft ship had been boarded by pirates in the Gulf of Aden. Iain, 51, from Edinburgh, and his team discovered that the crew of 19 Syrians had locked themselves in the ship’s strong room. Meanwhile, the pirates were trying to smoke them out.Iain said: “A merchant ship nearby saw the OS35 was on fire and went towards the ship to try to help.“I was screaming down the phone to the company’s security officer, ‘Don’t let your ship go anywhere near’. So they stood off and reported everything they could see.”Next morning five military vessels, including ships from the Chinese and Indian navies, arrived.Using Iain’s information, the crew was ­rescued and the pirates’ crew arrested. Former bank manager Iain added of his nomination: “To my mind it’s really a team honour rather than an individual.”Squadron Leader SUE SHILLADAY, Bridlington Sea CadetsSQUADRON Leader Sue Shilladay has been a tireless servant of the Cadet Force for decades – and a trailblazer.

It was arranged as a single-sex camp with a programme made easier for girls.“Instead, we went to the mixed Army camp.” During her long career Sue, from Bridlington, has inspired more than 5,000 youngsters with the best qualities of the Armed Forces – self-confidence, leadership skills, teamwork and social responsibility.She says: “I was responsible for both male and female cadets but my role allowed girl cadets to see that they could aspire to ­membership of the Armed Forces.”One of Sue’s proudest moments was taking a group of youngsters on a live firing exercise in the Mediterranean on board HMS Gloucester.The ship’s captain was one of her former cadets.Of her Millies nod Sue says: “I’m quite overwhelmed. I see it as a ­recognition of the contribution of all those who work with cadets.”One cadet said: “Sue really is an incredibly inspirational leader.”Hero at home: IndividualPetty Officer TOBY JONES, HMS TyneAS flood water thundered around him and nitrogen turned the air toxic last April, Petty Officer Jones knew he had to close a door to contain a leak that ­threatened lives on board HMS Tyne.But it also meant condemning his mate Rob Knott to almost certain death.Simon Jones - The Sun42 Petty Officer Toby Jones faced a hard decision between preventing a toxic leak and saving his friendPetty Officer Jones, 40, a married dad- of-two from Emsworth, Hants, said: “Rob is a good friend of mine.

A fire exercise triggered a water leak in the internal fire extinguisher system. Meanwhile nitrogen, designed to stop a fire spreading, was seeping in.With PO Knott inside, he ordered everyone out and closed the hatch.PO Jones then took the breathing apparatus from another sailor and went back into the room. He said: “It was pitch black. You couldn’t see anything – just water splashing into your face.” Eventually he found his friend lying lifeless and not breathing, and dragged him out up a flight of stairs. Toby said: “As the oxygen started to get back into his body, he gave what I can only describe as a life breath.Toby Jones shares his amazing story of bravery ahead of the Sun Military AwardsSimon Jones - The Sun42 Jones went back into the toxic room to rescue his friend“It was one of those harrowing sounds I will never be able to forget.“Closing the door, condemning a man, it was harrowing.

Cpl Keats said: “We tried to pull him out but we couldn’t, so Lindsay got inside.”L/Cpl Clarke added: “I got in ­underneath him, took his seatbelt off and I sort of got him on to my shoulder and pushed him out of the car.“At that point Vicki had his arm so I had to get around him and we dragged him over the side of the car to get him out.”The pair, both based at RAF Benson, Oxfordshire, estimate the car caught fire less than a minute after they got the driver, a young carer, free.They administered first aid until emergency services arrived. Police praised the pair’s “moral fibre” for intervening at enormous risk to their own lives.L/Cpl Clarke, said: “It was Army ­training kicking in – it was about getting that guy out of there.”Hero at home: UnitSOUTHERN DIVING UNIT 2, Royal NavyWHEN Portsmouth Harbour was dredged to make way for new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, more than five tonnes of Nazi bombs were hauled up from the seabed.Decades on from the Luftwaffe’s ­Second World War aerial bombardment of the seaport, the unexploded devices were once again threatening the city.MOD42 A member of Southern Diving Unit 2 making sure an unexploded bomb is made safeAnd the fearless frogmen of Southern Diving Unit 2 were there to save the day.Lieutenant Commander Jonny ­Campbell, Officer in Charge of the unit, said: “Purely from the amount of ­ordnance dropped or deployed during World War Two, we knew we were going to have our hands full.“The grit and effort shown by the team was formidable.”The Portsmouth-based unit, just 25 strong, has responded to 34 major alerts since dredging began two years ago.Every time the dredge crew found something, the divers would swim down into the murky waters to explore it. If it was a decaying device – liable to blow at any time – the harbour would be closed and the explosives dragged out to sea and detonated.Lt Cdr Campbell said: “It is a sense of fulfilment that you are making the ­Channel safer and almost paving the way for the aircraft carrier which is the future of the Royal Navy. It is great.”HMS St ALBANS, Royal NavyTHE UK’s on-call warship has been ready to react to any threat in British waters at a moment’s notice.HMS St Albans and her crew of 200 have circumnavigated the country multiple times, guarding us from threats.CROWN42 HMS St Albans, at the bottom of the picture, escorts two Russian warshipsThey were never more tested than when a Russian aircraft carrier and other ships sailed up the English Channel.As President Putin’s flotilla steamed within miles of our coast, HMS St Albans shadowed her every move.Commander Chris Ansell said: “You see people at their best when they are doing something that they have been trained for. But it was not a surprise.“We track these things all the time and we are prepared for these things.”The price of miscalculation was enormous but, thanks to the Navy’s man-marking job, the Russians passed safely.Cdr Ansell said: “You can count on several hands the sorts of things that could happen either deliberately or by accident, particularly with ageing bits of hardware using busy shipping lanes.“We certainly felt very happy that it was a job well done at the end of it.”He added: “The crew have far exceeded my expectations and my expectations were pretty high.”On the crew being nominated for a ­Millie, he says: “The whole ship’s ­company is over the moon.”MILITARY CO-RESPONDERS with South Central Ambulance ServiceHUNDREDS of serving troops volunteer their time to back ambulance service comrades saving lives in a Herculean job largely unseen by the public.One such scheme is bolstering the vital work of the South Central ­Ambulance Service right now, with amazing results.Between September and August, ­Military Co-Responders attended 5,626 incidents, conducting an impressive 2,496 volunteering shifts.UK MOD42 Military Co-Responders at RAF Halton in Buckinghamshire. These are troops who volunteer their time to help the ambulance serviceSince the start of October they have seen four “positive returns” – where patients’ hearts have stopped but were breathing by the time they got to ­hospital. And they do it all on top of their day jobs in the military.Flt Lt Claire Stanley, 36, based at RAF Halton, Bucks, is an aerospace battle manager by profession. But she is also acting team leader at the RAF Halton Co-responder team. She said: “We want to give back into the communities we are part of. We want to help.” The organisation is a charity and fundraises to ­operate rapid response vehicles to reach remote regions – which ambulances struggle to reach at speed.Flt Lt Stanley added: “It’s all voluntary, we do it in our spare time. We have rapid response cars supported by the ­ambulance service. On the team being up for a Millie, Flt Lt Stanley said: “We’re honoured and quite surprised. None of us do this for any glory or fame.”Support to forcesVeterans With DogsSUFFERING from battle stress, former Royal Marine Commando Craig MacLellan walked with his dog to recce the spot where he would take his own life.But as if she knew what he was about to do, Fudge the chocolate labrador went rigid.42 Craig receives a helping paw from his assistance dog BooCraig, 48, says: “She’d never done anything like it before and I actually said out loud, ‘I’m not going to do anything, girl’ and I kept my promise.”Instead, Craig contacted Combat Stress, which helps former service ­personnel ­suffering from mental health ­problems.The charity’s experts diagnosed Craig, who joined the Royal Marines at 16, as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.In 1989 he was at Deal Barracks in Kent when an IRA bomb went off, killing 11 ­Marines and injuring 21.Craig quit the Marines but later signed up for the Scots Guards, with whom he served in Northern Ireland.Garland PR42 Richard Mearns, a former Lance Corporal, has an assistance dog called ZiggyCraig says: “I saw horrific things that, even now, I can’t speak of. Friends were involved in incidents, and I lost one of them. A policewoman was shot right next to me.”Dog-lover Craig was allowed to take Fudge into therapy sessions where other veterans were being helped by Combat Stress.He says: “What happened next was ­amazing. It started with Fudge ambling round the room and somehow finding the person who needed the most support.“Just by quietly sitting next to them, ­allowing them to stroke her, Fudge seemed to find a way to get them to open up”Other countries including America, Canada, Australia and Holland had long been using assistance dogs. In 2012, with the support of Combat Stress and two universities, Craig started his own charity, Veterans With Dogs.This remarkable cause, based in Newton Abbott, Devon, harnesses the healing power of companionship with the animals.More than 100 ex-military personnel have benefited from canine therapy, and 30 veterans now have their own assistance dogs.These specially trained animals help with daily routines, from opening doors to getting them up in the morning to face the day.Along with Fudge, now his loved family pet, Craig has assistance dog Boo.42 Assistance dog Boo is trained to fetch Craig's medicine and turn on the lights if he has a nightmareBoo can even fetch his owner’s medication. Craig says: “When I wake from a nightmare, for instance, I just shout out the word ‘light’, and she switches it on.“If I sense a panic attack coming on, I have a safe command that means I can kneel and she will jump up and put her paws round my neck, a physical sensation that helps me calm down quickly, wherever I am.“If I’m in a public place where I can’t cope, I give her the command to get me out.”Craig has had six-year-old Boo since she was eight weeks old.He says: “Boo was the blueprint for the programme. We expected to see results after a couple of years but by the time she was six months old she was doing it all.”Now the charity has a waiting list for assistance dogs like Boo, which cost £20,000 each to be fully trained.One, Ziggy, is now with Richard Mearns, 35, a former Lance Corporal in the Royal Army Medical Corps, from Croydon, South London, who served in Iraq. They will both be attending the Millies tonight.Craig says: “For our veterans, having a dog can be the difference between life and death. I hate to say that, I really do, but it’s that important to the guys.”Craig and his team of medical experts and dog trainers were delighted to be nominated.He says: “The Millies is the best of the best. Just to have that recognition is fantastic.”Felix FundINVICTUS Games silver medallist, Sapper Clive Smith, was able to compete in September’s event thanks to a remarkable charity that supports Britain’s bomb disposal heroes.A £3,500 grant from the Felix Fund’s helped Clive, 33, get a bespoke wheelchair for the wheelchair rugby at Toronto. Former Royal Engineer Clive, of Cannock, Staffs, lost both legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan in 2010.42 The Felix Fund helped to pay for wheelchair rugby player Clive Smith's bespoke chairHe is just one of dozens to benefit from the fund, which was set up in 2011.It has since given out more than £1.5million in grants and assistance.Bomb search and disposal experts are different to other military because they deploy to war zones as individuals.Felix Fund’s chief executive Melanie Moughton says: “When they would land back at Brize Norton, everybody would go their separate ways. Because of the experiences they had gone through, there were a lot of issues.“People were dealing with it in different ways and felt they needed their own charity. We work across all three services, and the Met’s counter-terror unit.*“These teams would get back together for a week’s adventure ­training where they could meet over a beer in a safe environment.”Explosive Ordnance Disposal gets around 2,500 call-outs to everything from rogue fireworks to the Manchester Arena bombing, meaning they are “deployed at very, very short notice which puts pressure on families”.Melanie, the charity’s head for nearly three years, adds: “I was so excited when I heard we were being nominated for a Sun Millie. It is a phenomenal accolade for us.”The Jon Egging TrustNATHAN HOLLAND was a troubled teenager who had been excluded from school ten times.But four years later, he was voted head boy at his school, studied ­business at college and has begun work as a trainee accountant.42 Nathan Holland, bottom right, takes a selfie with Sir Stephen ­Hillier, centre. Holland turned his life around thanks to the Jon Egging TrustAnd three months ago the boy who avoided games at school ran the 13-mile Great North Run alongside Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Stephen ­Hillier.Much of the credit for Nathan’s transformation is due to the Jon Egging Trust (JET), set up in the name of a Red Arrows pilot who died during a Bournemouth air display.In just five years this remarkable charity has helped change the lives of 10,000 under-achieving young people like Nathan, 19, from Downham Market, Norfolk, by introducing them to military volunteers who can inspire teenagers to do well.Teenagers on the JET Blue Skies ­programme spend time over three years visiting RAF, Navy and MoD bases, learning from military ­personnel who pass on skills and, above all, fire ­enthusiasm into the kids.42 The charity has helped thousands of youngstersFlt Lt Jon Egging, 33, from Rutland, was experiencing more than six times G-Force in his Hawk Jet T1 jet Red 4 when he lost consciousness and crashed at Eastbourne in August 2011.His widow, Dr Emma Egging, 38, who now works as JET’s chief executive, said: “When Jon became part of the Red Arrows he understood the power of the red suit as a magnet to engage and inspire. After his death it felt like a natural step to set up a charity that was the ethos of Jon, the ethos of the RAF, the Reds and the military. Jon would be incredibly proud of being nominated.”Hero overseas: IndividualLeading Seaman SALLY HUGHES, Royal NavyFOURTEEN sailors owe their lives to the bravery and leadership of Leading Seaman Sally Hughes and her team.On February 11 this year, Type 45 destroyer HMS Dragon was ­heading for Lisbon when a mayday call was received from a stricken yacht 500 miles south-west off Land’s End.UK MOD Crown42 Leading Seaman Sally Hughes is being recognised for her bravery in saving those aboard a stricken yachtSailing through the night more than 500 nautical miles, the Royal Navy ship arrived on the scene as the yacht was taking on water and drifting further out into a worsening Atlantic storm.LS Hughes, 28, from Gosport, Hants, and her crew were there to save the sailors. She said: ­“Conditions were worse than we would ever think about putting the boat out in. We were in gale force winds, 50mph at times, and 18ft waves.”Despite the danger, LS Hughes along with bowman AB Kyle Porteous and the ship’s PT instructor Ryan Billington made 13 approaches over a gruelling two-hour period to lift all the crew off the stricken yacht and ferry them back to HMS Dragon 800 yards away.During one run, waves crashed the smaller rescue boat into the side of HMS Dragon and LS Hughes injured her arm but continued the rescue.She said: “I just think that day I was doing my job and all 14 people got to go back to their families. It’s enough for me to know that I did my job well.”Sgt KIRSTY LYON-TAYLOR, 4626 Sqdn, RAF Brize NortonRESERVIST nurse Kirsty Lyon-Taylor helped save the heroine behind the film I Dreamed of Africa.Animal campaigner and conservationist Kuki Gallmann, 74, who was played by Kim Basinger in the movie, was shot twice in the stomach by raiders at her ranch in Kenya in April.42 Kirsty Lyon-Taylor helped save the life of a famous conservationistShe was being accompanied off her ranch by armed wildlife rangers when one spotted three people.Before she could turn, a shot hit Kuki “like a punch in the lower abdomen” as she sat in the driver’s seat of her open-backed Land Cruiser.She fell sideways and felt another bullet tear through her guts before the rangers chased the ambushers away.Kuki rang to ask for a neighbour’s helicopter which took her to British Army medics at the Training Unit Kenya base. Among those waiting to give Kuki a blood transfusion and staunch the bleeding during a life-or-death flight to Nairobi was reservist Medical Emergency Response Team nurse Kirsty Lyon-Taylor, 35.She said: “Caring for the patient as a tight two-person team was frenetic.“It was only when she was safely delivered to hospital that I realised how much I’d been working and doing to save the patient’s life.”While she was recovering Kuki contacted the military medical team. Kirsty, from Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, says: “She sent us a very kind message thanking us for our efforts to help her. It was really touching.“I was simply doing my job to the best of my ability and was fortunate to be working with an experienced team.”Air Engineering ­Technician STU ROGERS, HMS MonmouthWHEN a tanker sank in the Indian Ocean this summer, HMS Monmouth’s crew were due to go on leave but turned round to race to the scene.As the merchant ship Rana 2 went under, other ships saved 12 but two crew were still missing in the water.©UK MOD CROWN COPYRIGHT, 201542 Air Engineering Technician Stu Rogers helped to save crew members from a sunken oil tankerFrom 300 feet above the water Air Engineering Technician Stu Rogers – a winchman on the ship’s Wildcat Mk 2 helicopter – tried to spot survivors among hundreds of pallets and debris in the oil-slicked sea.Stu, 29, from Marlborough, Wilts, says: “We were almost out of fuel when we spotted a man face-down in the water. He wasn’t in his life jacket and had obviously drowned.”As they were about to pull the victim from the water a merchant ship nearby spotted a survivor.Stu says: “In harness, I was lowered down into the water and got hit by 30ft waves, nearly as high as a house.“I managed to swim over and ­reassure him when I was hit by a wave. I was upside down in the water on the wire and had to let go of the guy.“The crew lifted me out of the water and we lowered a strop down without me in it and the guy managed to get in it and we lifted him out.”Hero overseas: UnitHMS MONMOUTH, Royal NavyHMS Monmouth and her crew have spent this year on maritime security operations, policing the high seas. They pulled off a helicopter rescue and a major drugs bust.On March 6, Commander Ian Feasey and his crew of 225 set sail for the ­Middle East, returning in December, after patrolling though the Arabian Gulf, Red Sea and Indian Ocean. In June, they received a mayday ­signal from a vessel in the Indian Ocean, 400 miles east of Somalia.42 The crew of HMS Monmouth display the busted drugsThe vessel had sunk in a storm and one sailor remained in the water. HMS Monmouth launched her ­chopper and rescued the last crew member.Cdr Feasey, said: “Our winch man managed to pluck the Indian sailor from the water in a 40ft swell in an oil slick with seconds to spare before the aircraft had to return for lack of fuel.”Soon they were back in the policing role – spending two days tracking a fishing dhow feared to be ferrying drugs. Cdr Feasey added: “When we got on board, the chaps moved about three tonnes of ice from a fish hold and, in a hidden compartment, found three quarters of a tonne of drugs. The haul, worth £65million, was headed to Britain.Talking about the nomination, Cdr Feasey said: “When I told the ship’s ­company [of the Millies nomination] they were overwhelmed. This makes them feel extremely ­valued for all the hard work they put in.”1st BATTALION, Royal Irish RegimentTHE Rangers of 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment were despatched to Kabul on a mission to keep the peace.In May, they were called out when an IS suicide car bomber targeted a Nato convoy, leaving scores injured.42 The Royal Irish Regiment have helped prevent casualties in dramatic situationsMajor Paul Martin, Officer Commanding B Company, said: “There were a number of Afghan civilians killed and wounded and clearly a few of their vehicles were damaged.”Later this year, Kabul was rocked by a massive blast outside the German Embassy that killed roughly 150 Afghan civilians and wounded more than 600.Maj Martin said: “When something of that magnitude, size and scale in that area goes off, everything is sort of exposed and a lot of people are in a lot of distress.“We saved the lives of quite a few of the Afghan security workers and we also helped to extract around four of the most seriously wounded from the German Embassy.”Around 250 Royal Irish troops deployed between December 2016 and last August to Kabul, training Afghan ­security forces and standing ready to react to emergencies.Without their rapid reaction times and extremely professional conduct, the number of casualties in both incidents could have been much higher.Maj Martin added: “I will clearly be biased but the guys worked flawlessly throughout.”UK REAPER FORCE, RAFFEARSOME Reaper drones are saving lives every day in the fight against IS.Crews operating from bases at RAF Waddington and America’s Creech Air Base in Nevada have been flying ­continuous missions as part of ­Operation Shader since October 2014.Darren Fletcher - The Sun42 Two drone pilots sit safely at their controlsThe officer commanding 13 Sqn, UK Reaper force, whose identity we are protecting, told The Sun: “Reaper has been ­central to every major engagement in the Shader campaign.”Recently over Mosul, Iraq, a Reaper crew protecting advancing friendly Iraqi security forces spotted a heavily armoured suicide bomb truck emerge from under the cover of a building.The Reaper’s Hellfire missile achieved a direct hit on the bomb truck seconds before it would have detonated.In another incident, a Reaper crew took out an IS sniper guarding a public execution in Abu Kamal, Syria, in May. The officer revealed the precision of the strike meant hundreds were kept “entirely safe while we put a stop to that execution”.Alamy42 A fearsome Predator drone carrying Hellfire missiles glides over a desertThere have been concerns over the rise of drone machines in warfare.But the officer explained: “We’ve got professional aircrew flying it. We work to the exact same rules of engagements . . . the only difference is the crew are not sat in the aircraft.” Best innovationAircraft Handling Warrant Officer PAUL MOONANAT a time of cutbacks, Warrant Officer Paul Moonan saved the MoD £4.5million – thanks to a brainwave.Britain’s new carrier HMS Queen ­Elizabeth has four acres of aircraft deck.42 Paul Moonan 's idea for adapting a tractor to fight fires has saved millions of poundsIf an aircraft bursts into flames, the only way to propel water or foam on to the blaze is from a fire-fighting vehicle.American carriers use purpose-built fire-fighters costing £500,000 each, but Royal Navy WO1 Paul, 48, was convinced there was a better – and much cheaper – way to keep aircrew safe.The father-of-two from Fareham, Hants, is married to Suzanne and joined the Royal Navy nearly 30 years ago. He spent much of his career on aircraft car-riers Ark Royal, Illustrious and Invincible.Now working in military procurement, Paul was convinced a tractor already used to move aircraft on board could be adapted to also become a fire vehicle.He took a huge gamble and approached the tractor’s creator DFS of Halifax, West Yorks, and its engineers invented a module for the existing vehicles that included tanks to carry 450litres of water and 60litres of foam.HMS Queen Elizabeth will now carry nine tractors, three of which will be ­fitted with the fire-fighting module. Paul says: “If a tractor fails, we have spares and it takes roughly three hours to convert an aircraft mover into a fire-fighter.”Sniper technologyTHE Army’s current rifle system allows snipers to achieve precision shots over ­significant distances.Successful shots at night can be more challenging, though.42 A sniper rifle with the new night-vision scope will give sharpshooters the edge in battleBut thanks to a team at the MoD, ­British snipers will have the edge with an ­amazing new sighting system that offers improved night-vision images.Developed by scientists at the Defence Science and Technology ­Laboratory with industry partners, it has significantly improved night-vision images.Snipers, who were involved throughout the tech’s development, have confirmed it gives us a massive advantage, with one military adviser saying: “This gives the modern sniper a persistent 24-hour capability, regardless of background light levels.”UK defence companies Leonardo, Qioptiq and Insitu developed the ­concept and took it to the Army, who tested it in live trials. They found the new sight has better magnification and resolution, so snipers could easily make out targets, even in darkness.One extra feature is new image matching software, which allows the spotter to take a picture of the target, and this is automatically matched with the image in the shooter’s sight.This means they can agree on the ­target quickly and don’t need to use revealing markers, such as lasers.Harris T7 bomb disposal robotOUR world-renowned bomb hunters will have a new comrade in the fight against deadly improvised explosive devices – the Harris T7 robot.The tracked robots will soon replace the Wheelbarrow droid, used extensively in Afghanistan, to investigate and disarm deadly devices.42 The T7 robot is viewed as a game-changer for safety in bomb disposalEquipped with digital cameras, ­lightning-fast datalinks, an adjustable manipulation arm and tough all-terrain treads, the robots are able to neutralise a wide range of threats.The MoD is spending £55million on 56 of these remarkable robots, which have human-like arms that can be operated from a safe distance with a remote- control handgrip.Its precision control and dexterity cuts completion time and improves mission effectiveness.A variety of attachments enable the use of standard-issue sensors, disruptors and tools that support a wide range of missions, including Hazmat – hazardous materials clean-up – and the ability to disable IEDs planted inside vehicles.Sacha Spragg, Project Manager at Defence Equipment and Support, which is acquiring the system, said: “The Harris T7 is a game-changer for the ­British Army. It will take bomb disposal tasks to the next level in confidence and control.”Inspiring othersSpear 17, ArmySPEAR 17 became the first all-British military team to complete a full, unsupported traverse of ­Antarctica.The record-breaking outfit of Army reservists, led by Parachute Regiment Captain Lou Rudd, trekked 1,100 miles in 67 days to conquer the toughest terrain on the planet.42 Ice guys  . . .  Alun George, Alex Brazier, Lou Rudd, Ollie Stoten, James Facer-Childs, Chris BrookeTheir superhuman expedition was the brainchild of Capt Rudd, who wanted to raise the profile of the Reserves, raise money for charity and honour his fallen mate Henry Worsley.Worsley — an SAS officer and explorer — died in January 2016 while attempting the first solo crossing of the Antarctic.The full team was made up of expedition leader Lou, 48, plus Reservist doctors Ollie Stoten and Alex Brazier, both 27, James Facer-Childs, another Reserves doctor, 30, paramedic Chris Brooke, 35, and Alun George, 43, who left the Reserves in 2017.They set out on the first leg of their 730-mile trek to the South Pole in November 2016 — reaching their target in just 40 days, in time for Christmas Day.42 Spear 17's Ollie Stoten experienced the severe effects of the coldAfter taking on a resupply of fuel and provisions, and sadly having to say goodbye to Alun who was deemed medically unfit to continue, the second leg took them another 400 miles.It was gruelling going, tramping for ten hours a day non-stop, in temperatures touching minus 53C, hauling 165kg of gear on sleds through a polar wilderness.When they reached the location Henry got to, they paused for a moving remembrance service.The team conquered the harsh weather, crevasses, isolation from the outside world and constant mental and physical rigours.42 The team trekked 1,100 miles across AntarticaAnd they did it to raise funds for ABF The Soldiers’ Charity.Capt Rudd was full of praise for his team, saying: “It was an incredible performance to go from zero to hero.”Captain UMESH PUN, Army Reserve Signals UnitCAPTAIN Pun is an inspiration to the Gurkha community at home and abroad. He joined the Gurkhas aged 17 in 1979 and is still serving today.In recent years Capt Pun, 56, a dad-of-three, has been fundamental in establishing The Gurkha Homes Project for veterans.42 Captain Pun's project helped Gurkha veterans who wanted to settle in the UKAfter actress Joanna Lumley’s high-profile campaign to allow Gurkha veterans to settle in the UK, many veterans wanted to take up the offer.Capt Pun, who served in ­Bosnia, Sierra Leone and Afghanistan, said: “The problem is with the housing and language. So I came up with the Homes Project.”Now 26 couples are housed in Colchester, thanks to Capt Pun. And he has confirmed a £1m investment to build a second home for Gurkhas in Kent.His heroic efforts are also in action abroad. As in 2015 he was on the ground in Nepal within days of the earthquake.He went on to help build a school for 350 children.Capt Pun explains: “I came from a very poor background, so I always feel if I can make someone happy, I’ll be happy.”Chief Petty Officer ANDY ‘GIBBO’ GIBBSANDY ‘Gibbo’ Gibbs is a one-man fundraising machine.The tireless sailor, 47, of Chinnor, Oxfordshire, has single-handedly collected more than half a million pounds for Sun-backed military charity Help for Heroes.42 One-man fundraising machine . . . Chief Petty Officer GibbsChief Petty Officer Gibbo, based at HMS Collingwood in Fareham, Hants, who joined the Royal Navy aged 16, revealed his fundraising ­odyssey was hatched over a beer on a beach with a ­comrade. He said: “We were coming back from the Far East and decided we wanted to do something for the guys that were wounded in Afghanistan.“We started out to raise ten grand by walking across ­Scotland. We made £14,000 in one event and got the bug.”From there Gibbo took collection buckets to concerts and sports games. He has also walked more than 1,000 miles in aid of charity – all on top of his day job. CPO Gibbo was delighted by his Millies ­nomination, saying: “It’s just ­amazing.

My legs just felt really funny because the adrenaline was pumping.“I was thinking that maybe I could help out a little bit more because I’d been in Afghanistan and done the training, through the battle courses the military do.“One of my bosses, Dan Smith, said I should go and start doing triage in and around Victoria train station.”PA:Press Association43 In May, a homemade bomb was detonated as concert-goers were leaving Manchester ArenaBecause of the ongoing inquiry into the bombing, in which 22 people died and 250 were wounded, Philip cannot reveal too much detail about his part in the horrific events of May 22.But such was the scale of the devastation — and the extent to which emergency services were stretched — that he was soon drawing on all his military training to save lives.Despite the threat of a second bomb, he identified the injured and prioritised them for treatment.Realising that patient evacuation was becoming an issue, Philip took charge by coordinating the stretcher lift of patients.He worked tirelessly as part of a large team of rescuers to control the scene, detailing crews to undertake treatment and delivering life-saving care himself.PA:Press Association43 A tribute left to the victims in the wake of the bombingHis dedication, bravery and calm in the chaos saved numerous lives.Philip says: “I have a strong sense of duty to the community that I live with and that I work for.“I joined the reserve as a medic because I like to help people, to serve and to make a difference.“We do what we do and we do our job at great personal cost. It’s not just physical but the psychological damage we endure because we, as ordinary people doing extraordinary things, have to endure some very nasty sights.“People touched by the events in ­Manchester will always carry that scar with them. I know I will.”On being nominated for a Millie, he adds: “It’s quite humbling to be nominated for something which I feel is part of my job.“In some ways, I feel the recognition it has brought me is undeserved because it is for something that should never have happened.“Countless people, not just ambulance, fire police and civilians, played their part in the aftermath. I have never been prouder to be a Mancunian.”Best reservist nomineesLieutenant Commander IAIN BEATON, Maritime Trade Operations BranchFOUR reservists, led by Lieutenant ­Commander Beaton, play a crucial role in keeping perilous shipping routes in the Middle East safe from pirates and drug smugglers.Based in Dubai, this small but vital unit uses military and commercial information to operate a 24-hour advice service to merchant ships.43 Iain Beaton is helping to keep important shipping routes safeThe team, who have left their jobs, families and friends for the two-year posting, also coordinate rescue missions when things go wrong.Like on the evening of April 8 this year, when the master of the bulk carrier OS35 reported that his 600ft ship had been boarded by pirates in the Gulf of Aden. Iain, 51, from Edinburgh, and his team discovered that the crew of 19 Syrians had locked themselves in the ship’s strong room. Meanwhile, the pirates were trying to smoke them out.Iain said: “A merchant ship nearby saw the OS35 was on fire and went towards the ship to try to help.“I was screaming down the phone to the company’s security officer, ‘Don’t let your ship go anywhere near’. So they stood off and reported everything they could see.”Next morning five military vessels, including ships from the Chinese and Indian navies, arrived.Using Iain’s information, the crew was ­rescued and the pirates’ crew arrested. Former bank manager Iain added of his nomination: “To my mind it’s really a team honour rather than an individual.”Squadron Leader SUE SHILLADAY, Bridlington Sea CadetsSQUADRON Leader Sue Shilladay has been a tireless servant of the Cadet Force for decades – and a trailblazer. She joined in 1978, becoming one of the first women to be ­commissioned into Bridlington School Combined Cadet Force.She was also its first female ­Contingent Commander and fought for female recruits to be treated equally. However she initially had to fight prejudice, too.43 Sue Shilladay has inspired thousands of young peopleShe says: “I refused to participate in the first RAF camp for girls. It was arranged as a single-sex camp with a programme made easier for girls.“Instead, we went to the mixed Army camp.” During her long career Sue, from Bridlington, has inspired more than 5,000 youngsters with the best qualities of the Armed Forces – self-confidence, leadership skills, teamwork and social responsibility.She says: “I was responsible for both male and female cadets but my role allowed girl cadets to see that they could aspire to ­membership of the Armed Forces.”One of Sue’s proudest moments was taking a group of youngsters on a live firing exercise in the Mediterranean on board HMS Gloucester.The ship’s captain was one of her former cadets.Of her Millies nod Sue says: “I’m quite overwhelmed. I see it as a ­recognition of the contribution of all those who work with cadets.”One cadet said: “Sue really is an incredibly inspirational leader.”Hero at home: IndividualPetty Officer TOBY JONES, HMS TyneAS flood water thundered around him and nitrogen turned the air toxic last April, Petty Officer Jones knew he had to close a door to contain a leak that ­threatened lives on board HMS Tyne.But it also meant condemning his mate Rob Knott to almost certain death.Simon Jones - The Sun43 Petty Officer Toby Jones faced a hard decision between preventing a toxic leak and saving his friendToby Jones shares his amazing story of bravery ahead of the Sun Military AwardsPetty Officer Jones, 40, a married dad- of-two from Emsworth, Hants, said: “Rob is a good friend of mine. You hope you never have to make that decision.”Catastrophe struck while the ship was docked at Faslane, HM Naval Base Clyde. A fire exercise triggered a water leak in the internal fire extinguisher system. Meanwhile nitrogen, designed to stop a fire spreading, was seeping in.With PO Knott inside, he ordered everyone out and closed the hatch.PO Jones then took the breathing apparatus from another sailor and went back into the room. He said: “It was pitch black. You couldn’t see anything – just water splashing into your face.” Eventually he found his friend lying lifeless and not breathing, and dragged him out up a flight of stairs. Toby said: “As the oxygen started to get back into his body, he gave what I can only describe as a life breath.Simon Jones - The Sun43 Jones went back into the toxic room to rescue his friend“It was one of those harrowing sounds I will never be able to forget.“Closing the door, condemning a man, it was harrowing. You hope no one has to go through that. But we all got out alive.”Lt JARED BAMBRIDGE 1st Battalion The ­Yorkshire RegimentWHEN a terror trio struck at the heart of London, off-duty soldier Jared Bambridge ran into the carnage – while everyone else was fleeing for their lives.The young lieutenant was walking home from a theatre trip with his girlfriend when Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba carried out their attack by London Bridge.MOD_CROWN 201743 Jared Bambridge saved many lives during the night of the London Bridge terror attackThey killed eight people and injured 48 others on June 3 – but the death toll would have been higher were it not for Lt Bambridge, 23. He treated around ten injured people, saving multiple lives.He said: “It wasn’t a pleasant thing to happen, but I am really glad that I was there and able to help people.”Jared, from York, first went to the aid of a 51-year-old man with blood gushing from two stab wounds. As he applied pressure to the injuries, bursts of gunfire rang out. Using his first aid training, he spent two hours treating four more bleeding casualties and helped more to safety outside the safety cordon – all despite an ongoing bomb threat.MOD_CROWN 201743 Jared remains humble, despite his heroic actions on the night of the attackHe said: “There were so many people lending hands. It was fantastic how everyone – civilians or services – all naturally gelled.”Despite his heroics, he remains typically humble, saying: “I don’t expect anything in return for what I did.”L/Cpl LINDSAY CLARKE, Royal Logistics Corps, and Cpl VICKI KEATS, RAFDESIGNATED base duty driver Lance Corporal Lindsay Clarke, 28, was collecting Corporal Vicki Keats, 32, from Gatwick Airport after an exercise overseas when the pair were flagged down and told there had been a crash.Cpl Keats said: “I called the police as we were running there. I saw the driver was still in the car – which was smoking.”MOD43 Lindsay Clarke and Vicki Keats leaped into action to save a man from a burning carA red Corsa had careered off the country lane, smashed through the tree line, flipped over and was about to burst into flames. Cpl Keats said: “We tried to pull him out but we couldn’t, so Lindsay got inside.”L/Cpl Clarke added: “I got in ­underneath him, took his seatbelt off and I sort of got him on to my shoulder and pushed him out of the car.“At that point Vicki had his arm so I had to get around him and we dragged him over the side of the car to get him out.”The pair, both based at RAF Benson, Oxfordshire, estimate the car caught fire less than a minute after they got the driver, a young carer, free.They administered first aid until emergency services arrived. Police praised the pair’s “moral fibre” for intervening at enormous risk to their own lives.L/Cpl Clarke, said: “It was Army ­training kicking in – it was about getting that guy out of there.”Hero at home: UnitSOUTHERN DIVING UNIT 2, Royal NavyWHEN Portsmouth Harbour was dredged to make way for new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, more than five tonnes of Nazi bombs were hauled up from the seabed.Decades on from the Luftwaffe’s ­Second World War aerial bombardment of the seaport, the unexploded devices were once again threatening the city.MOD43 A member of Southern Diving Unit 2 making sure an unexploded bomb is made safeAnd the fearless frogmen of Southern Diving Unit 2 were there to save the day.Lieutenant Commander Jonny ­Campbell, Officer in Charge of the unit, said: “Purely from the amount of ­ordnance dropped or deployed during World War Two, we knew we were going to have our hands full.“The grit and effort shown by the team was formidable.”The Portsmouth-based unit, just 25 strong, has responded to 34 major alerts since dredging began two years ago.Every time the dredge crew found something, the divers would swim down into the murky waters to explore it. If it was a decaying device – liable to blow at any time – the harbour would be closed and the explosives dragged out to sea and detonated.Lt Cdr Campbell said: “It is a sense of fulfilment that you are making the ­Channel safer and almost paving the way for the aircraft carrier which is the future of the Royal Navy. It is great.”HMS St ALBANS, Royal NavyTHE UK’s on-call warship has been ready to react to any threat in British waters at a moment’s notice.HMS St Albans and her crew of 200 have circumnavigated the country multiple times, guarding us from threats.CROWN43 HMS St Albans, at the bottom of the picture, escorts two Russian warshipsThey were never more tested than when a Russian aircraft carrier and other ships sailed up the English Channel.As President Putin’s flotilla steamed within miles of our coast, HMS St Albans shadowed her every move.Commander Chris Ansell said: “You see people at their best when they are doing something that they have been trained for. But it was not a surprise.“We track these things all the time and we are prepared for these things.”The price of miscalculation was enormous but, thanks to the Navy’s man-marking job, the Russians passed safely.Cdr Ansell said: “You can count on several hands the sorts of things that could happen either deliberately or by accident, particularly with ageing bits of hardware using busy shipping lanes.“We certainly felt very happy that it was a job well done at the end of it.”He added: “The crew have far exceeded my expectations and my expectations were pretty high.”On the crew being nominated for a ­Millie, he says: “The whole ship’s ­company is over the moon.”MILITARY CO-RESPONDERS with South Central Ambulance ServiceHUNDREDS of serving troops volunteer their time to back ambulance service comrades saving lives in a Herculean job largely unseen by the public.One such scheme is bolstering the vital work of the South Central ­Ambulance Service right now, with amazing results.Between September and August, ­Military Co-Responders attended 5,626 incidents, conducting an impressive 2,496 volunteering shifts.UK MOD43 Military Co-Responders at RAF Halton in Buckinghamshire. These are troops who volunteer their time to help the ambulance serviceSince the start of October they have seen four “positive returns” – where patients’ hearts have stopped but were breathing by the time they got to ­hospital. And they do it all on top of their day jobs in the military.Flt Lt Claire Stanley, 36, based at RAF Halton, Bucks, is an aerospace battle manager by profession. But she is also acting team leader at the RAF Halton Co-responder team. She said: “We want to give back into the communities we are part of. We want to help.” The organisation is a charity and fundraises to ­operate rapid response vehicles to reach remote regions – which ambulances struggle to reach at speed.Flt Lt Stanley added: “It’s all voluntary, we do it in our spare time. We have rapid response cars supported by the ­ambulance service. On the team being up for a Millie, Flt Lt Stanley said: “We’re honoured and quite surprised. None of us do this for any glory or fame.”43Support to forcesVeterans With DogsSUFFERING from battle stress, former Royal Marine Commando Craig MacLellan walked with his dog to recce the spot where he would take his own life.But as if she knew what he was about to do, Fudge the chocolate labrador went rigid.43 Craig receives a helping paw from his assistance dog BooCraig, 48, says: “She’d never done anything like it before and I actually said out loud, ‘I’m not going to do anything, girl’ and I kept my promise.”Instead, Craig contacted Combat Stress, which helps former service ­personnel ­suffering from mental health ­problems.The charity’s experts diagnosed Craig, who joined the Royal Marines at 16, as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.In 1989 he was at Deal Barracks in Kent when an IRA bomb went off, killing 11 ­Marines and injuring 21.Craig quit the Marines but later signed up for the Scots Guards, with whom he served in Northern Ireland.Garland PR43 Richard Mearns, a former Lance Corporal, has an assistance dog called ZiggyCraig says: “I saw horrific things that, even now, I can’t speak of. Friends were involved in incidents, and I lost one of them. A policewoman was shot right next to me.”Dog-lover Craig was allowed to take Fudge into therapy sessions where other veterans were being helped by Combat Stress.He says: “What happened next was ­amazing. It started with Fudge ambling round the room and somehow finding the person who needed the most support.“Just by quietly sitting next to them, ­allowing them to stroke her, Fudge seemed to find a way to get them to open up”Other countries including America, Canada, Australia and Holland had long been using assistance dogs. In 2012, with the support of Combat Stress and two universities, Craig started his own charity, Veterans With Dogs.This remarkable cause, based in Newton Abbott, Devon, harnesses the healing power of companionship with the animals.More than 100 ex-military personnel have benefited from canine therapy, and 30 veterans now have their own assistance dogs.These specially trained animals help with daily routines, from opening doors to getting them up in the morning to face the day.Along with Fudge, now his loved family pet, Craig has assistance dog Boo.43 Assistance dog Boo is trained to fetch Craig's medicine and turn on the lights if he has a nightmareBoo can even fetch his owner’s medication. Craig says: “When I wake from a nightmare, for instance, I just shout out the word ‘light’, and she switches it on.“If I sense a panic attack coming on, I have a safe command that means I can kneel and she will jump up and put her paws round my neck, a physical sensation that helps me calm down quickly, wherever I am.“If I’m in a public place where I can’t cope, I give her the command to get me out.”Craig has had six-year-old Boo since she was eight weeks old.He says: “Boo was the blueprint for the programme. We expected to see results after a couple of years but by the time she was six months old she was doing it all.”Now the charity has a waiting list for assistance dogs like Boo, which cost £20,000 each to be fully trained.One, Ziggy, is now with Richard Mearns, 35, a former Lance Corporal in the Royal Army Medical Corps, from Croydon, South London, who served in Iraq. They will both be attending the Millies tonight.Craig says: “For our veterans, having a dog can be the difference between life and death. I hate to say that, I really do, but it’s that important to the guys.”Craig and his team of medical experts and dog trainers were delighted to be nominated.He says: “The Millies is the best of the best. Just to have that recognition is fantastic.”Felix FundINVICTUS Games silver medallist, Sapper Clive Smith, was able to compete in September’s event thanks to a remarkable charity that supports Britain’s bomb disposal heroes.A £3,500 grant from the Felix Fund’s helped Clive, 33, get a bespoke wheelchair for the wheelchair rugby at Toronto. Former Royal Engineer Clive, of Cannock, Staffs, lost both legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan in 2010.43 The Felix Fund helped to pay for wheelchair rugby player Clive Smith's bespoke chairHe is just one of dozens to benefit from the fund, which was set up in 2011.It has since given out more than £1.5million in grants and assistance.Bomb search and disposal experts are different to other military because they deploy to war zones as individuals.Felix Fund’s chief executive Melanie Moughton says: “When they would land back at Brize Norton, everybody would go their separate ways. Because of the experiences they had gone through, there were a lot of issues.“People were dealing with it in different ways and felt they needed their own charity. We work across all three services, and the Met’s counter-terror unit.*“These teams would get back together for a week’s adventure ­training where they could meet over a beer in a safe environment.”Explosive Ordnance Disposal gets around 2,500 call-outs to everything from rogue fireworks to the Manchester Arena bombing, meaning they are “deployed at very, very short notice which puts pressure on families”.Melanie, the charity’s head for nearly three years, adds: “I was so excited when I heard we were being nominated for a Sun Millie. It is a phenomenal accolade for us.”The Jon Egging TrustNATHAN HOLLAND was a troubled teenager who had been excluded from school ten times.But four years later, he was voted head boy at his school, studied ­business at college and has begun work as a trainee accountant.43 Nathan Holland, bottom right, takes a selfie with Sir Stephen ­Hillier, centre. Holland turned his life around thanks to the Jon Egging TrustAnd three months ago the boy who avoided games at school ran the 13-mile Great North Run alongside Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Stephen ­Hillier.Much of the credit for Nathan’s transformation is due to the Jon Egging Trust (JET), set up in the name of a Red Arrows pilot who died during a Bournemouth air display.In just five years this remarkable charity has helped change the lives of 10,000 under-achieving young people like Nathan, 19, from Downham Market, Norfolk, by introducing them to military volunteers who can inspire teenagers to do well.Teenagers on the JET Blue Skies ­programme spend time over three years visiting RAF, Navy and MoD bases, learning from military ­personnel who pass on skills and, above all, fire ­enthusiasm into the kids.43 The charity has helped thousands of youngstersFlt Lt Jon Egging, 33, from Rutland, was experiencing more than six times G-Force in his Hawk Jet T1 jet Red 4 when he lost consciousness and crashed at Eastbourne in August 2011.His widow, Dr Emma Egging, 38, who now works as JET’s chief executive, said: “When Jon became part of the Red Arrows he understood the power of the red suit as a magnet to engage and inspire. After his death it felt like a natural step to set up a charity that was the ethos of Jon, the ethos of the RAF, the Reds and the military. Jon would be incredibly proud of being nominated.”Hero overseas: IndividualLeading Seaman SALLY HUGHES, Royal NavyFOURTEEN sailors owe their lives to the bravery and leadership of Leading Seaman Sally Hughes and her team.On February 11 this year, Type 45 destroyer HMS Dragon was ­heading for Lisbon when a mayday call was received from a stricken yacht 500 miles south-west off Land’s End.UK MOD Crown43 Leading Seaman Sally Hughes is being recognised for her bravery in saving those aboard a stricken yachtSailing through the night more than 500 nautical miles, the Royal Navy ship arrived on the scene as the yacht was taking on water and drifting further out into a worsening Atlantic storm.LS Hughes, 28, from Gosport, Hants, and her crew were there to save the sailors. She said: ­“Conditions were worse than we would ever think about putting the boat out in. We were in gale force winds, 50mph at times, and 18ft waves.”Despite the danger, LS Hughes along with bowman AB Kyle Porteous and the ship’s PT instructor Ryan Billington made 13 approaches over a gruelling two-hour period to lift all the crew off the stricken yacht and ferry them back to HMS Dragon 800 yards away.During one run, waves crashed the smaller rescue boat into the side of HMS Dragon and LS Hughes injured her arm but continued the rescue.She said: “I just think that day I was doing my job and all 14 people got to go back to their families. It’s enough for me to know that I did my job well.”Sgt KIRSTY LYON-TAYLOR, 4626 Sqdn, RAF Brize NortonRESERVIST nurse Kirsty Lyon-Taylor helped save the heroine behind the film I Dreamed of Africa.Animal campaigner and conservationist Kuki Gallmann, 74, who was played by Kim Basinger in the movie, was shot twice in the stomach by raiders at her ranch in Kenya in April.43 Kirsty Lyon-Taylor helped save the life of a famous conservationistShe was being accompanied off her ranch by armed wildlife rangers when one spotted three people.Before she could turn, a shot hit Kuki “like a punch in the lower abdomen” as she sat in the driver’s seat of her open-backed Land Cruiser.She fell sideways and felt another bullet tear through her guts before the rangers chased the ambushers away.Kuki rang to ask for a neighbour’s helicopter which took her to British Army medics at the Training Unit Kenya base. Among those waiting to give Kuki a blood transfusion and staunch the bleeding during a life-or-death flight to Nairobi was reservist Medical Emergency Response Team nurse Kirsty Lyon-Taylor, 35.She said: “Caring for the patient as a tight two-person team was frenetic.“It was only when she was safely delivered to hospital that I realised how much I’d been working and doing to save the patient’s life.”While she was recovering Kuki contacted the military medical team. Kirsty, from Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, says: “She sent us a very kind message thanking us for our efforts to help her. It was really touching.“I was simply doing my job to the best of my ability and was fortunate to be working with an experienced team.”Air Engineering ­Technician STU ROGERS, HMS MonmouthWHEN a tanker sank in the Indian Ocean this summer, HMS Monmouth’s crew were due to go on leave but turned round to race to the scene.As the merchant ship Rana 2 went under, other ships saved 12 but two crew were still missing in the water.©UK MOD CROWN COPYRIGHT, 201543 Air Engineering Technician Stu Rogers helped to save crew members from a sunken oil tankerFrom 300 feet above the water Air Engineering Technician Stu Rogers – a winchman on the ship’s Wildcat Mk 2 helicopter – tried to spot survivors among hundreds of pallets and debris in the oil-slicked sea.Stu, 29, from Marlborough, Wilts, says: “We were almost out of fuel when we spotted a man face-down in the water. He wasn’t in his life jacket and had obviously drowned.”As they were about to pull the victim from the water a merchant ship nearby spotted a survivor.Stu says: “In harness, I was lowered down into the water and got hit by 30ft waves, nearly as high as a house.“I managed to swim over and ­reassure him when I was hit by a wave. I was upside down in the water on the wire and had to let go of the guy.“The crew lifted me out of the water and we lowered a strop down without me in it and the guy managed to get in it and we lifted him out.”Hero overseas: UnitHMS MONMOUTH, Royal NavyHMS Monmouth and her crew have spent this year on maritime security operations, policing the high seas. They pulled off a helicopter rescue and a major drugs bust.On March 6, Commander Ian Feasey and his crew of 225 set sail for the ­Middle East, returning in December, after patrolling though the Arabian Gulf, Red Sea and Indian Ocean. In June, they received a mayday ­signal from a vessel in the Indian Ocean, 400 miles east of Somalia.43 The crew of HMS Monmouth display the busted drugsThe vessel had sunk in a storm and one sailor remained in the water. HMS Monmouth launched her ­chopper and rescued the last crew member.Cdr Feasey, said: “Our winch man managed to pluck the Indian sailor from the water in a 40ft swell in an oil slick with seconds to spare before the aircraft had to return for lack of fuel.”Soon they were back in the policing role – spending two days tracking a fishing dhow feared to be ferrying drugs. Cdr Feasey added: “When we got on board, the chaps moved about three tonnes of ice from a fish hold and, in a hidden compartment, found three quarters of a tonne of drugs. The haul, worth £65million, was headed to Britain.Talking about the nomination, Cdr Feasey said: “When I told the ship’s ­company [of the Millies nomination] they were overwhelmed. This makes them feel extremely ­valued for all the hard work they put in.”1st BATTALION, Royal Irish RegimentTHE Rangers of 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment were despatched to Kabul on a mission to keep the peace.In May, they were called out when an IS suicide car bomber targeted a Nato convoy, leaving scores injured.43 The Royal Irish Regiment have helped prevent casualties in dramatic situationsMajor Paul Martin, Officer Commanding B Company, said: “There were a number of Afghan civilians killed and wounded and clearly a few of their vehicles were damaged.”Later this year, Kabul was rocked by a massive blast outside the German Embassy that killed roughly 150 Afghan civilians and wounded more than 600.Maj Martin said: “When something of that magnitude, size and scale in that area goes off, everything is sort of exposed and a lot of people are in a lot of distress.“We saved the lives of quite a few of the Afghan security workers and we also helped to extract around four of the most seriously wounded from the German Embassy.”Around 250 Royal Irish troops deployed between December 2016 and last August to Kabul, training Afghan ­security forces and standing ready to react to emergencies.Without their rapid reaction times and extremely professional conduct, the number of casualties in both incidents could have been much higher.Maj Martin added: “I will clearly be biased but the guys worked flawlessly throughout.”UK REAPER FORCE, RAFFEARSOME Reaper drones are saving lives every day in the fight against IS.Crews operating from bases at RAF Waddington and America’s Creech Air Base in Nevada have been flying ­continuous missions as part of ­Operation Shader since October 2014.Darren Fletcher - The Sun43 Two drone pilots sit safely at their controlsThe officer commanding 13 Sqn, UK Reaper force, whose identity we are protecting, told The Sun: “Reaper has been ­central to every major engagement in the Shader campaign.”Recently over Mosul, Iraq, a Reaper crew protecting advancing friendly Iraqi security forces spotted a heavily armoured suicide bomb truck emerge from under the cover of a building.The Reaper’s Hellfire missile achieved a direct hit on the bomb truck seconds before it would have detonated.In another incident, a Reaper crew took out an IS sniper guarding a public execution in Abu Kamal, Syria, in May. The officer revealed the precision of the strike meant hundreds were kept “entirely safe while we put a stop to that execution”.Alamy43 A fearsome Predator drone carrying Hellfire missiles glides over a desertThere have been concerns over the rise of drone machines in warfare.But the officer explained: “We’ve got professional aircrew flying it.

I’d never done anything like that — the most notable nautical thing I’d done before that was go on the Woolwich ferry.”The crew were raising cash for the Endeavour Fund, Blesma, Help for Heroes and Row2Recovery.And it was brutal going, with the crews rowing two hours on, two hours off in the day, and three hours on three hours off at night.Lee added: “It was incredibly tiring. I found the first couple of days really challenging — it was not so much the physical exertion, it was the sleep.“And it was terrifying, the waves were massive. From the word go we had a large side swell, so that was scary.”But the challenge awakened something in Lee that he thought was gone — demonstrating the inspirational power of adventure.He added: “It sounds trite that I went on a journey to discover myself, but it really was that.“It was the single most important and positive thing to happen to me.“I’m incredibly proud of being part of it, massively proud.”Former Snr Aircraftman LUKE WIGMAN, and ­former Captain IBI ALI, Yorkshire RegimentWOUNDED war heroes Ibi Ali and Luke Wigman conquered one of the toughest running races on the planet – the World Marathon Challenge.RAF paratrooper Luke, 31, of Nottingham, was serving with the crack Special ­Forces Support Group when he ­suffered horrific leg injuries in a bomb blast in Helmand, Afghanistan in 2011.43 The pair ran in Antarctica as part of the World Marathon ChallengeAnd decorated former Army officer Ibi, 40, from York, lost part of his right arm to a roadside bomb in Iraq in 2007.But together they ran seven marathons in seven days on seven continents to raise almost £1million for a new rehabilitation centre for injured and sick troops. Starting in Antarctica, the pair then ran consecutive 26.2mile races in Chile, Miami, Madrid, Marrakech, Dubai and Sydney in less than a week.Determined Ibi became the first amputee to complete the challenge while Luke completed the race in the third fastest time ever.They did it all for the new £300million Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre (DNRC), being completed right now in Loughborough, Leics, ready to open next October.43 The two raised almost £1million by running seven marathons in seven days on seven continentsIbi said: “The DNRC is going to be epic. I don’t think people will get the full scale of it until it opens its doors.“I want to allow servicemen and women who haven’t even been born yet to have the best level of care.”In total the pair ran 183.4 miles and flew for 59 hours covering 27,000miles in a week.When they started in Antarctica an international stop clock began, ­counting down the 168 hours the ­runners had to complete the challenge.On being nominated Luke said: “We don’t do these things for a pat on the back or to boost our own ego, we do it to make a difference.“But when someone recognises you along the way, it’s an incredible feeling.”Officer Cadet PADMAJA ‘PIYA’ DAS, Royal Navy ReservesPLUCKY Reservist Das has repeatedly beaten the odds to realise her dream of serving in the Armed Forces.But the Officer Cadet, 26, of Telford, Shrops, has had to obliterate stereotypes and cultural, religious and gender barriers to make it happen.43 Reservist Padmaja beams with pride in her armed forces uniformPiya came to the UK from West Bengal aged 11 in 2002, when her dad moved here with work.It was a seismic shock. She recalled: “I had left my friends, my family and everything back in India. I could not speak English, I could not make friends. There was a lot of taunting, which changed into bullying.”She found her solace in studying.After completing GCSEs and A Levels in maths, further maths, physics and economics she achieved a BTEC in electronic engineering while working part time in Primark.While studying aerospace engineering at university she also worked night shifts at Debenhams to pay the fees.Piya then achieved a masters in the same subject and after 138 job applications was employed as a specialist instructor at the Engineering School, HMS Sultan. After multiple attempts to join the Armed Forces were thwarted by residency laws, she joined the Royal Navy Reserves.She now works at RAF Cosford training engineering officers in aerodynamics, thermodynamics and engineering mathematics.In her spare time she is an ambassador for the Royal Navy, visiting schools to promote engineering and inspire students, especially young girls.All this was made possible through her determination to follow her dreams – and serve in uniform.She said: “I am too stubborn to give up. The day I wore my uniform it was a massive glow of pride. I had earned it because I have stretched myself – the Reserves have stretched me.“When I did my passing out parade I was the most happiest person on Earth.”Best innovationAircraft Handling Warrant Officer PAUL MOONANAT a time of cutbacks, Warrant Officer Paul Moonan saved the MoD £4.5million – thanks to a brainwave.Britain’s new carrier HMS Queen ­Elizabeth has four acres of aircraft deck.43 Paul Moonan 's idea for adapting a tractor to fight fires has saved millions of poundsIf an aircraft bursts into flames, the only way to propel water or foam on to the blaze is from a fire-fighting vehicle.American carriers use purpose-built fire-fighters costing £500,000 each, but Royal Navy WO1 Paul, 48, was convinced there was a better – and much cheaper – way to keep aircrew safe.The father-of-two from Fareham, Hants, is married to Suzanne and joined the Royal Navy nearly 30 years ago. He spent much of his career on aircraft car-riers Ark Royal, Illustrious and Invincible.Now working in military procurement, Paul was convinced a tractor already used to move aircraft on board could be adapted to also become a fire vehicle.He took a huge gamble and approached the tractor’s creator DFS of Halifax, West Yorks, and its engineers invented a module for the existing vehicles that included tanks to carry 450litres of water and 60litres of foam.HMS Queen Elizabeth will now carry nine tractors, three of which will be ­fitted with the fire-fighting module. Paul says: “If a tractor fails, we have spares and it takes roughly three hours to convert an aircraft mover into a fire-fighter.”Sniper technologyTHE Army’s current rifle system allows snipers to achieve precision shots over ­significant distances.Successful shots at night can be more challenging, though.43 A sniper rifle with the new night-vision scope will give sharpshooters the edge in battleBut thanks to a team at the MoD, ­British snipers will have the edge with an ­amazing new sighting system that offers improved night-vision images.Developed by scientists at the Defence Science and Technology ­Laboratory with industry partners, it has significantly improved night-vision images.Snipers, who were involved throughout the tech’s development, have confirmed it gives us a massive advantage, with one military adviser saying: “This gives the modern sniper a persistent 24-hour capability, regardless of background light levels.”UK defence companies Leonardo, Qioptiq and Insitu developed the ­concept and took it to the Army, who tested it in live trials. They found the new sight has better magnification and resolution, so snipers could easily make out targets, even in darkness.One extra feature is new image matching software, which allows the spotter to take a picture of the target, and this is automatically matched with the image in the shooter’s sight.This means they can agree on the ­target quickly and don’t need to use revealing markers, such as lasers.Harris T7 bomb disposal robotOUR world-renowned bomb hunters will have a new comrade in the fight against deadly improvised explosive devices – the Harris T7 robot.The tracked robots will soon replace the Wheelbarrow droid, used extensively in Afghanistan, to investigate and disarm deadly devices.43 The T7 robot is viewed as a game-changer for safety in bomb disposalEquipped with digital cameras, ­lightning-fast datalinks, an adjustable manipulation arm and tough all-terrain treads, the robots are able to neutralise a wide range of threats.The MoD is spending £55million on 56 of these remarkable robots, which have human-like arms that can be operated from a safe distance with a remote- control handgrip.Its precision control and dexterity cuts completion time and improves mission effectiveness.A variety of attachments enable the use of standard-issue sensors, disruptors and tools that support a wide range of missions, including Hazmat – hazardous materials clean-up – and the ability to disable IEDs planted inside vehicles.Sacha Spragg, Project Manager at Defence Equipment and Support, which is acquiring the system, said: “The Harris T7 is a game-changer for the ­British Army. It will take bomb disposal tasks to the next level in confidence and control.”Inspiring othersSpear 17, ArmySPEAR 17 became the first all-British military team to complete a full, unsupported traverse of ­Antarctica.The record-breaking outfit of Army reservists, led by Parachute Regiment Captain Lou Rudd, trekked 1,100 miles in 67 days to conquer the toughest terrain on the planet.43 Ice guys  . . .  Alun George, Alex Brazier, Lou Rudd, Ollie Stoten, James Facer-Childs, Chris BrookeTheir superhuman expedition was the brainchild of Capt Rudd, who wanted to raise the profile of the Reserves, raise money for charity and honour his fallen mate Henry Worsley.Worsley — an SAS officer and explorer — died in January 2016 while attempting the first solo crossing of the Antarctic.The full team was made up of expedition leader Lou, 48, plus Reservist doctors Ollie Stoten and Alex Brazier, both 27, James Facer-Childs, another Reserves doctor, 30, paramedic Chris Brooke, 35, and Alun George, 43, who left the Reserves in 2017.They set out on the first leg of their 730-mile trek to the South Pole in November 2016 — reaching their target in just 40 days, in time for Christmas Day.43 Spear 17's Ollie Stoten experienced the severe effects of the coldAfter taking on a resupply of fuel and provisions, and sadly having to say goodbye to Alun who was deemed medically unfit to continue, the second leg took them another 400 miles.It was gruelling going, tramping for ten hours a day non-stop, in temperatures touching minus 53C, hauling 165kg of gear on sleds through a polar wilderness.When they reached the location Henry got to, they paused for a moving remembrance service.The team conquered the harsh weather, crevasses, isolation from the outside world and constant mental and physical rigours.43 The team trekked 1,100 miles across AntarticaAnd they did it to raise funds for ABF The Soldiers’ Charity.Capt Rudd was full of praise for his team, saying: “It was an incredible performance to go from zero to hero.”Captain UMESH PUN, Army Reserve Signals UnitCAPTAIN Pun is an inspiration to the Gurkha community at home and abroad. He joined the Gurkhas aged 17 in 1979 and is still serving today.In recent years Capt Pun, 56, a dad-of-three, has been fundamental in establishing The Gurkha Homes Project for veterans.43 Captain Pun's project helped Gurkha veterans who wanted to settle in the UKAfter actress Joanna Lumley’s high-profile campaign to allow Gurkha veterans to settle in the UK, many veterans wanted to take up the offer.Capt Pun, who served in ­Bosnia, Sierra Leone and Afghanistan, said: “The problem is with the housing and language.

My legs just felt really funny because the adrenaline was pumping.“I was thinking that maybe I could help out a little bit more because I’d been in Afghanistan and done the training, through the battle courses the military do.“One of my bosses, Dan Smith, said I should go and start doing triage in and around Victoria train station.”PA:Press Association42 In May, a homemade bomb was detonated as concert-goers were leaving Manchester ArenaBecause of the ongoing inquiry into the bombing, in which 22 people died and 250 were wounded, Philip cannot reveal too much detail about his part in the horrific events of May 22.But such was the scale of the devastation — and the extent to which emergency services were stretched — that he was soon drawing on all his military training to save lives.Despite the threat of a second bomb, he identified the injured and prioritised them for treatment.Realising that patient evacuation was becoming an issue, Philip took charge by coordinating the stretcher lift of patients.He worked tirelessly as part of a large team of rescuers to control the scene, detailing crews to undertake treatment and delivering life-saving care himself.PA:Press Association42 A tribute left to the victims in the wake of the bombingHis dedication, bravery and calm in the chaos saved numerous lives.Philip says: “I have a strong sense of duty to the community that I live with and that I work for.“I joined the reserve as a medic because I like to help people, to serve and to make a difference.“We do what we do and we do our job at great personal cost. It’s not just physical but the psychological damage we endure because we, as ordinary people doing extraordinary things, have to endure some very nasty sights.“People touched by the events in ­Manchester will always carry that scar with them. I know I will.”On being nominated for a Millie, he adds: “It’s quite humbling to be nominated for something which I feel is part of my job.“In some ways, I feel the recognition it has brought me is undeserved because it is for something that should never have happened.“Countless people, not just ambulance, fire police and civilians, played their part in the aftermath. I have never been prouder to be a Mancunian.”Lieutenant Commander IAIN BEATON, Maritime Trade Operations BranchFOUR reservists, led by Lieutenant ­Commander Beaton, play a crucial role in keeping perilous shipping routes in the Middle East safe from pirates and drug smugglers.Based in Dubai, this small but vital unit uses military and commercial information to operate a 24-hour advice service to merchant ships.42 Iain Beaton is helping to keep important shipping routes safeThe team, who have left their jobs, families and friends for the two-year posting, also coordinate rescue missions when things go wrong.Like on the evening of April 8 this year, when the master of the bulk carrier OS35 reported that his 600ft ship had been boarded by pirates in the Gulf of Aden. Iain, 51, from Edinburgh, and his team discovered that the crew of 19 Syrians had locked themselves in the ship’s strong room. Meanwhile, the pirates were trying to smoke them out.Iain said: “A merchant ship nearby saw the OS35 was on fire and went towards the ship to try to help.“I was screaming down the phone to the company’s security officer, ‘Don’t let your ship go anywhere near’. So they stood off and reported everything they could see.”Next morning five military vessels, including ships from the Chinese and Indian navies, arrived.Using Iain’s information, the crew was ­rescued and the pirates’ crew arrested. Former bank manager Iain added of his nomination: “To my mind it’s really a team honour rather than an individual.”Squadron Leader SUE SHILLADAY, Bridlington Sea CadetsSQUADRON Leader Sue Shilladay has been a tireless servant of the Cadet Force for decades – and a trailblazer. She joined in 1978, becoming one of the first women to be ­commissioned into Bridlington School Combined Cadet Force.She was also its first female ­Contingent Commander and fought for female recruits to be treated equally. However she initially had to fight prejudice, too.42 Sue Shilladay has inspired thousands of young peopleShe says: “I refused to participate in the first RAF camp for girls. It was arranged as a single-sex camp with a programme made easier for girls.“Instead, we went to the mixed Army camp.” During her long career Sue, from Bridlington, has inspired more than 5,000 youngsters with the best qualities of the Armed Forces – self-confidence, leadership skills, teamwork and social responsibility.She says: “I was responsible for both male and female cadets but my role allowed girl cadets to see that they could aspire to ­membership of the Armed Forces.”One of Sue’s proudest moments was taking a group of youngsters on a live firing exercise in the Mediterranean on board HMS Gloucester.The ship’s captain was one of her former cadets.Of her Millies nod Sue says: “I’m quite overwhelmed. I see it as a ­recognition of the contribution of all those who work with cadets.”One cadet said: “Sue really is an incredibly inspirational leader.”Hero at home: IndividualPetty Officer TOBY JONES, HMS TyneAS flood water thundered around him and nitrogen turned the air toxic last April, Petty Officer Jones knew he had to close a door to contain a leak that ­threatened lives on board HMS Tyne.But it also meant condemning his mate Rob Knott to almost certain death.Simon Jones - The Sun42 Petty Officer Toby Jones faced a hard decision between preventing a toxic leak and saving his friendPetty Officer Jones, 40, a married dad- of-two from Emsworth, Hants, said: “Rob is a good friend of mine. You hope you never have to make that decision.”Catastrophe struck while the ship was docked at Faslane, HM Naval Base Clyde. A fire exercise triggered a water leak in the internal fire extinguisher system. Meanwhile nitrogen, designed to stop a fire spreading, was seeping in.With PO Knott inside, he ordered everyone out and closed the hatch.PO Jones then took the breathing apparatus from another sailor and went back into the room. He said: “It was pitch black. You couldn’t see anything – just water splashing into your face.” Eventually he found his friend lying lifeless and not breathing, and dragged him out up a flight of stairs. Toby said: “As the oxygen started to get back into his body, he gave what I can only describe as a life breath.Toby Jones shares his amazing story of bravery ahead of the Sun Military AwardsSimon Jones - The Sun42 Jones went back into the toxic room to rescue his friend“It was one of those harrowing sounds I will never be able to forget.“Closing the door, condemning a man, it was harrowing.

But we all got out alive.”Lt JARED BAMBRIDGE 1st Battalion The ­Yorkshire RegimentWHEN a terror trio struck at the heart of London, off-duty soldier Jared Bambridge ran into the carnage – while everyone else was fleeing for their lives.The young lieutenant was walking home from a theatre trip with his girlfriend when Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba carried out their attack by London Bridge.MOD_CROWN 201742 Jared Bambridge saved many lives during the night of the London Bridge terror attackThey killed eight people and injured 48 others on June 3 – but the death toll would have been higher were it not for Lt Bambridge, 23. He treated around ten injured people, saving multiple lives.He said: “It wasn’t a pleasant thing to happen, but I am really glad that I was there and able to help people.”Jared, from York, first went to the aid of a 51-year-old man with blood gushing from two stab wounds. As he applied pressure to the injuries, bursts of gunfire rang out. Using his first aid training, he spent two hours treating four more bleeding casualties and helped more to safety outside the safety cordon – all despite an ongoing bomb threat.MOD_CROWN 201742 Jared remains humble, despite his heroic actions on the night of the attackHe said: “There were so many people lending hands. It was fantastic how everyone – civilians or services – all naturally gelled.”Despite his heroics, he remains typically humble, saying: “I don’t expect anything in return for what I did.”L/Cpl LINDSAY CLARKE, Royal Logistics Corps, and Cpl VICKI KEATS, RAFDESIGNATED base duty driver Lance Corporal Lindsay Clarke, 28, was collecting Corporal Vicki Keats, 32, from Gatwick Airport after an exercise overseas when the pair were flagged down and told there had been a crash.Cpl Keats said: “I called the police as we were running there. I saw the driver was still in the car – which was smoking.”MOD42 Lindsay Clarke and Vicki Keats leaped into action to save a man from a burning carA red Corsa had careered off the country lane, smashed through the tree line, flipped over and was about to burst into flames. Cpl Keats said: “We tried to pull him out but we couldn’t, so Lindsay got inside.”L/Cpl Clarke added: “I got in ­underneath him, took his seatbelt off and I sort of got him on to my shoulder and pushed him out of the car.“At that point Vicki had his arm so I had to get around him and we dragged him over the side of the car to get him out.”The pair, both based at RAF Benson, Oxfordshire, estimate the car caught fire less than a minute after they got the driver, a young carer, free.They administered first aid until emergency services arrived. Police praised the pair’s “moral fibre” for intervening at enormous risk to their own lives.L/Cpl Clarke, said: “It was Army ­training kicking in – it was about getting that guy out of there.”Hero at home: UnitSOUTHERN DIVING UNIT 2, Royal NavyWHEN Portsmouth Harbour was dredged to make way for new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, more than five tonnes of Nazi bombs were hauled up from the seabed.Decades on from the Luftwaffe’s ­Second World War aerial bombardment of the seaport, the unexploded devices were once again threatening the city.MOD42 A member of Southern Diving Unit 2 making sure an unexploded bomb is made safeAnd the fearless frogmen of Southern Diving Unit 2 were there to save the day.Lieutenant Commander Jonny ­Campbell, Officer in Charge of the unit, said: “Purely from the amount of ­ordnance dropped or deployed during World War Two, we knew we were going to have our hands full.“The grit and effort shown by the team was formidable.”The Portsmouth-based unit, just 25 strong, has responded to 34 major alerts since dredging began two years ago.Every time the dredge crew found something, the divers would swim down into the murky waters to explore it. If it was a decaying device – liable to blow at any time – the harbour would be closed and the explosives dragged out to sea and detonated.Lt Cdr Campbell said: “It is a sense of fulfilment that you are making the ­Channel safer and almost paving the way for the aircraft carrier which is the future of the Royal Navy. It is great.”HMS St ALBANS, Royal NavyTHE UK’s on-call warship has been ready to react to any threat in British waters at a moment’s notice.HMS St Albans and her crew of 200 have circumnavigated the country multiple times, guarding us from threats.CROWN42 HMS St Albans, at the bottom of the picture, escorts two Russian warshipsThey were never more tested than when a Russian aircraft carrier and other ships sailed up the English Channel.As President Putin’s flotilla steamed within miles of our coast, HMS St Albans shadowed her every move.Commander Chris Ansell said: “You see people at their best when they are doing something that they have been trained for. But it was not a surprise.“We track these things all the time and we are prepared for these things.”The price of miscalculation was enormous but, thanks to the Navy’s man-marking job, the Russians passed safely.Cdr Ansell said: “You can count on several hands the sorts of things that could happen either deliberately or by accident, particularly with ageing bits of hardware using busy shipping lanes.“We certainly felt very happy that it was a job well done at the end of it.”He added: “The crew have far exceeded my expectations and my expectations were pretty high.”On the crew being nominated for a ­Millie, he says: “The whole ship’s ­company is over the moon.”MILITARY CO-RESPONDERS with South Central Ambulance ServiceHUNDREDS of serving troops volunteer their time to back ambulance service comrades saving lives in a Herculean job largely unseen by the public.One such scheme is bolstering the vital work of the South Central ­Ambulance Service right now, with amazing results.Between September and August, ­Military Co-Responders attended 5,626 incidents, conducting an impressive 2,496 volunteering shifts.UK MOD42 Military Co-Responders at RAF Halton in Buckinghamshire.

None of us do this for any glory or fame.”Support to forcesVeterans With DogsSUFFERING from battle stress, former Royal Marine Commando Craig MacLellan walked with his dog to recce the spot where he would take his own life.But as if she knew what he was about to do, Fudge the chocolate labrador went rigid.42 Craig receives a helping paw from his assistance dog BooCraig, 48, says: “She’d never done anything like it before and I actually said out loud, ‘I’m not going to do anything, girl’ and I kept my promise.”Instead, Craig contacted Combat Stress, which helps former service ­personnel ­suffering from mental health ­problems.The charity’s experts diagnosed Craig, who joined the Royal Marines at 16, as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.In 1989 he was at Deal Barracks in Kent when an IRA bomb went off, killing 11 ­Marines and injuring 21.Craig quit the Marines but later signed up for the Scots Guards, with whom he served in Northern Ireland.Garland PR42 Richard Mearns, a former Lance Corporal, has an assistance dog called ZiggyCraig says: “I saw horrific things that, even now, I can’t speak of. Friends were involved in incidents, and I lost one of them. A policewoman was shot right next to me.”Dog-lover Craig was allowed to take Fudge into therapy sessions where other veterans were being helped by Combat Stress.He says: “What happened next was ­amazing. It started with Fudge ambling round the room and somehow finding the person who needed the most support.“Just by quietly sitting next to them, ­allowing them to stroke her, Fudge seemed to find a way to get them to open up”Other countries including America, Canada, Australia and Holland had long been using assistance dogs. In 2012, with the support of Combat Stress and two universities, Craig started his own charity, Veterans With Dogs.This remarkable cause, based in Newton Abbott, Devon, harnesses the healing power of companionship with the animals.More than 100 ex-military personnel have benefited from canine therapy, and 30 veterans now have their own assistance dogs.These specially trained animals help with daily routines, from opening doors to getting them up in the morning to face the day.Along with Fudge, now his loved family pet, Craig has assistance dog Boo.42 Assistance dog Boo is trained to fetch Craig's medicine and turn on the lights if he has a nightmareBoo can even fetch his owner’s medication. Craig says: “When I wake from a nightmare, for instance, I just shout out the word ‘light’, and she switches it on.“If I sense a panic attack coming on, I have a safe command that means I can kneel and she will jump up and put her paws round my neck, a physical sensation that helps me calm down quickly, wherever I am.“If I’m in a public place where I can’t cope, I give her the command to get me out.”Craig has had six-year-old Boo since she was eight weeks old.He says: “Boo was the blueprint for the programme. We expected to see results after a couple of years but by the time she was six months old she was doing it all.”Now the charity has a waiting list for assistance dogs like Boo, which cost £20,000 each to be fully trained.One, Ziggy, is now with Richard Mearns, 35, a former Lance Corporal in the Royal Army Medical Corps, from Croydon, South London, who served in Iraq. They will both be attending the Millies tonight.Craig says: “For our veterans, having a dog can be the difference between life and death. I hate to say that, I really do, but it’s that important to the guys.”Craig and his team of medical experts and dog trainers were delighted to be nominated.He says: “The Millies is the best of the best. Just to have that recognition is fantastic.”Felix FundINVICTUS Games silver medallist, Sapper Clive Smith, was able to compete in September’s event thanks to a remarkable charity that supports Britain’s bomb disposal heroes.A £3,500 grant from the Felix Fund’s helped Clive, 33, get a bespoke wheelchair for the wheelchair rugby at Toronto. Former Royal Engineer Clive, of Cannock, Staffs, lost both legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan in 2010.42 The Felix Fund helped to pay for wheelchair rugby player Clive Smith's bespoke chairHe is just one of dozens to benefit from the fund, which was set up in 2011.It has since given out more than £1.5million in grants and assistance.Bomb search and disposal experts are different to other military because they deploy to war zones as individuals.Felix Fund’s chief executive Melanie Moughton says: “When they would land back at Brize Norton, everybody would go their separate ways. Because of the experiences they had gone through, there were a lot of issues.“People were dealing with it in different ways and felt they needed their own charity. We work across all three services, and the Met’s counter-terror unit.*“These teams would get back together for a week’s adventure ­training where they could meet over a beer in a safe environment.”Explosive Ordnance Disposal gets around 2,500 call-outs to everything from rogue fireworks to the Manchester Arena bombing, meaning they are “deployed at very, very short notice which puts pressure on families”.Melanie, the charity’s head for nearly three years, adds: “I was so excited when I heard we were being nominated for a Sun Millie. It is a phenomenal accolade for us.”The Jon Egging TrustNATHAN HOLLAND was a troubled teenager who had been excluded from school ten times.But four years later, he was voted head boy at his school, studied ­business at college and has begun work as a trainee accountant.42 Nathan Holland, bottom right, takes a selfie with Sir Stephen ­Hillier, centre. Holland turned his life around thanks to the Jon Egging TrustAnd three months ago the boy who avoided games at school ran the 13-mile Great North Run alongside Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Stephen ­Hillier.Much of the credit for Nathan’s transformation is due to the Jon Egging Trust (JET), set up in the name of a Red Arrows pilot who died during a Bournemouth air display.In just five years this remarkable charity has helped change the lives of 10,000 under-achieving young people like Nathan, 19, from Downham Market, Norfolk, by introducing them to military volunteers who can inspire teenagers to do well.Teenagers on the JET Blue Skies ­programme spend time over three years visiting RAF, Navy and MoD bases, learning from military ­personnel who pass on skills and, above all, fire ­enthusiasm into the kids.42 The charity has helped thousands of youngstersFlt Lt Jon Egging, 33, from Rutland, was experiencing more than six times G-Force in his Hawk Jet T1 jet Red 4 when he lost consciousness and crashed at Eastbourne in August 2011.His widow, Dr Emma Egging, 38, who now works as JET’s chief executive, said: “When Jon became part of the Red Arrows he understood the power of the red suit as a magnet to engage and inspire. After his death it felt like a natural step to set up a charity that was the ethos of Jon, the ethos of the RAF, the Reds and the military. Jon would be incredibly proud of being nominated.”Hero overseas: IndividualLeading Seaman SALLY HUGHES, Royal NavyFOURTEEN sailors owe their lives to the bravery and leadership of Leading Seaman Sally Hughes and her team.On February 11 this year, Type 45 destroyer HMS Dragon was ­heading for Lisbon when a mayday call was received from a stricken yacht 500 miles south-west off Land’s End.UK MOD Crown42 Leading Seaman Sally Hughes is being recognised for her bravery in saving those aboard a stricken yachtSailing through the night more than 500 nautical miles, the Royal Navy ship arrived on the scene as the yacht was taking on water and drifting further out into a worsening Atlantic storm.LS Hughes, 28, from Gosport, Hants, and her crew were there to save the sailors. She said: ­“Conditions were worse than we would ever think about putting the boat out in. We were in gale force winds, 50mph at times, and 18ft waves.”Despite the danger, LS Hughes along with bowman AB Kyle Porteous and the ship’s PT instructor Ryan Billington made 13 approaches over a gruelling two-hour period to lift all the crew off the stricken yacht and ferry them back to HMS Dragon 800 yards away.During one run, waves crashed the smaller rescue boat into the side of HMS Dragon and LS Hughes injured her arm but continued the rescue.She said: “I just think that day I was doing my job and all 14 people got to go back to their families. It’s enough for me to know that I did my job well.”Sgt KIRSTY LYON-TAYLOR, 4626 Sqdn, RAF Brize NortonRESERVIST nurse Kirsty Lyon-Taylor helped save the heroine behind the film I Dreamed of Africa.Animal campaigner and conservationist Kuki Gallmann, 74, who was played by Kim Basinger in the movie, was shot twice in the stomach by raiders at her ranch in Kenya in April.42 Kirsty Lyon-Taylor helped save the life of a famous conservationistShe was being accompanied off her ranch by armed wildlife rangers when one spotted three people.Before she could turn, a shot hit Kuki “like a punch in the lower abdomen” as she sat in the driver’s seat of her open-backed Land Cruiser.She fell sideways and felt another bullet tear through her guts before the rangers chased the ambushers away.Kuki rang to ask for a neighbour’s helicopter which took her to British Army medics at the Training Unit Kenya base. Among those waiting to give Kuki a blood transfusion and staunch the bleeding during a life-or-death flight to Nairobi was reservist Medical Emergency Response Team nurse Kirsty Lyon-Taylor, 35.She said: “Caring for the patient as a tight two-person team was frenetic.“It was only when she was safely delivered to hospital that I realised how much I’d been working and doing to save the patient’s life.”While she was recovering Kuki contacted the military medical team. Kirsty, from Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, says: “She sent us a very kind message thanking us for our efforts to help her. It was really touching.“I was simply doing my job to the best of my ability and was fortunate to be working with an experienced team.”Air Engineering ­Technician STU ROGERS, HMS MonmouthWHEN a tanker sank in the Indian Ocean this summer, HMS Monmouth’s crew were due to go on leave but turned round to race to the scene.As the merchant ship Rana 2 went under, other ships saved 12 but two crew were still missing in the water.©UK MOD CROWN COPYRIGHT, 201542 Air Engineering Technician Stu Rogers helped to save crew members from a sunken oil tankerFrom 300 feet above the water Air Engineering Technician Stu Rogers – a winchman on the ship’s Wildcat Mk 2 helicopter – tried to spot survivors among hundreds of pallets and debris in the oil-slicked sea.Stu, 29, from Marlborough, Wilts, says: “We were almost out of fuel when we spotted a man face-down in the water. He wasn’t in his life jacket and had obviously drowned.”As they were about to pull the victim from the water a merchant ship nearby spotted a survivor.Stu says: “In harness, I was lowered down into the water and got hit by 30ft waves, nearly as high as a house.“I managed to swim over and ­reassure him when I was hit by a wave. I was upside down in the water on the wire and had to let go of the guy.“The crew lifted me out of the water and we lowered a strop down without me in it and the guy managed to get in it and we lifted him out.”Hero overseas: UnitHMS MONMOUTH, Royal NavyHMS Monmouth and her crew have spent this year on maritime security operations, policing the high seas. They pulled off a helicopter rescue and a major drugs bust.On March 6, Commander Ian Feasey and his crew of 225 set sail for the ­Middle East, returning in December, after patrolling though the Arabian Gulf, Red Sea and Indian Ocean. In June, they received a mayday ­signal from a vessel in the Indian Ocean, 400 miles east of Somalia.42 The crew of HMS Monmouth display the busted drugsThe vessel had sunk in a storm and one sailor remained in the water. HMS Monmouth launched her ­chopper and rescued the last crew member.Cdr Feasey, said: “Our winch man managed to pluck the Indian sailor from the water in a 40ft swell in an oil slick with seconds to spare before the aircraft had to return for lack of fuel.”Soon they were back in the policing role – spending two days tracking a fishing dhow feared to be ferrying drugs. Cdr Feasey added: “When we got on board, the chaps moved about three tonnes of ice from a fish hold and, in a hidden compartment, found three quarters of a tonne of drugs. The haul, worth £65million, was headed to Britain.Talking about the nomination, Cdr Feasey said: “When I told the ship’s ­company [of the Millies nomination] they were overwhelmed. This makes them feel extremely ­valued for all the hard work they put in.”1st BATTALION, Royal Irish RegimentTHE Rangers of 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment were despatched to Kabul on a mission to keep the peace.In May, they were called out when an IS suicide car bomber targeted a Nato convoy, leaving scores injured.42 The Royal Irish Regiment have helped prevent casualties in dramatic situationsMajor Paul Martin, Officer Commanding B Company, said: “There were a number of Afghan civilians killed and wounded and clearly a few of their vehicles were damaged.”Later this year, Kabul was rocked by a massive blast outside the German Embassy that killed roughly 150 Afghan civilians and wounded more than 600.Maj Martin said: “When something of that magnitude, size and scale in that area goes off, everything is sort of exposed and a lot of people are in a lot of distress.“We saved the lives of quite a few of the Afghan security workers and we also helped to extract around four of the most seriously wounded from the German Embassy.”Around 250 Royal Irish troops deployed between December 2016 and last August to Kabul, training Afghan ­security forces and standing ready to react to emergencies.Without their rapid reaction times and extremely professional conduct, the number of casualties in both incidents could have been much higher.Maj Martin added: “I will clearly be biased but the guys worked flawlessly throughout.”UK REAPER FORCE, RAFFEARSOME Reaper drones are saving lives every day in the fight against IS.Crews operating from bases at RAF Waddington and America’s Creech Air Base in Nevada have been flying ­continuous missions as part of ­Operation Shader since October 2014.Darren Fletcher - The Sun42 Two drone pilots sit safely at their controlsThe officer commanding 13 Sqn, UK Reaper force, whose identity we are protecting, told The Sun: “Reaper has been ­central to every major engagement in the Shader campaign.”Recently over Mosul, Iraq, a Reaper crew protecting advancing friendly Iraqi security forces spotted a heavily armoured suicide bomb truck emerge from under the cover of a building.The Reaper’s Hellfire missile achieved a direct hit on the bomb truck seconds before it would have detonated.In another incident, a Reaper crew took out an IS sniper guarding a public execution in Abu Kamal, Syria, in May. The officer revealed the precision of the strike meant hundreds were kept “entirely safe while we put a stop to that execution”.Alamy42 A fearsome Predator drone carrying Hellfire missiles glides over a desertThere have been concerns over the rise of drone machines in warfare.But the officer explained: “We’ve got professional aircrew flying it.

I’d never done anything like that — the most notable nautical thing I’d done before that was go on the Woolwich ferry.”The crew were raising cash for the Endeavour Fund, Blesma, Help for Heroes and Row2Recovery.And it was brutal going, with the crews rowing two hours on, two hours off in the day, and three hours on three hours off at night.Lee added: “It was incredibly tiring. I found the first couple of days really challenging — it was not so much the physical exertion, it was the sleep.“And it was terrifying, the waves were massive. From the word go we had a large side swell, so that was scary.”But the challenge awakened something in Lee that he thought was gone — demonstrating the inspirational power of adventure.He added: “It sounds trite that I went on a journey to discover myself, but it really was that.“It was the single most important and positive thing to happen to me.“I’m incredibly proud of being part of it, massively proud.”Former Snr Aircraftman LUKE WIGMAN, and ­former Captain IBI ALI, Yorkshire RegimentWOUNDED war heroes Ibi Ali and Luke Wigman conquered one of the toughest running races on the planet – the World Marathon Challenge.RAF paratrooper Luke, 31, of Nottingham, was serving with the crack Special ­Forces Support Group when he ­suffered horrific leg injuries in a bomb blast in Helmand, Afghanistan in 2011.42 The pair ran in Antarctica as part of the World Marathon ChallengeAnd decorated former Army officer Ibi, 40, from York, lost part of his right arm to a roadside bomb in Iraq in 2007.But together they ran seven marathons in seven days on seven continents to raise almost £1million for a new rehabilitation centre for injured and sick troops. Starting in Antarctica, the pair then ran consecutive 26.2mile races in Chile, Miami, Madrid, Marrakech, Dubai and Sydney in less than a week.Determined Ibi became the first amputee to complete the challenge while Luke completed the race in the third fastest time ever.They did it all for the new £300million Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre (DNRC), being completed right now in Loughborough, Leics, ready to open next October.42 The two raised almost £1million by running seven marathons in seven days on seven continentsIbi said: “The DNRC is going to be epic. I don’t think people will get the full scale of it until it opens its doors.“I want to allow servicemen and women who haven’t even been born yet to have the best level of care.”In total the pair ran 183.4 miles and flew for 59 hours covering 27,000miles in a week.When they started in Antarctica an international stop clock began, ­counting down the 168 hours the ­runners had to complete the challenge.On being nominated Luke said: “We don’t do these things for a pat on the back or to boost our own ego, we do it to make a difference.“But when someone recognises you along the way, it’s an incredible feeling.”Officer Cadet PADMAJA ‘PIYA’ DAS, Royal Navy ReservesPLUCKY Reservist Das has repeatedly beaten the odds to realise her dream of serving in the Armed Forces.But the Officer Cadet, 26, of Telford, Shrops, has had to obliterate stereotypes and cultural, religious and gender barriers to make it happen.42 Reservist Padmaja beams with pride in her armed forces uniformPiya came to the UK from West Bengal aged 11 in 2002, when her dad moved here with work.It was a seismic shock. She recalled: “I had left my friends, my family and everything back in India. I could not speak English, I could not make friends. There was a lot of taunting, which changed into bullying.”She found her solace in studying.After completing GCSEs and A Levels in maths, further maths, physics and economics she achieved a BTEC in electronic engineering while working part time in Primark.While studying aerospace engineering at university she also worked night shifts at Debenhams to pay the fees.Piya then achieved a masters in the same subject and after 138 job applications was employed as a specialist instructor at the Engineering School, HMS Sultan. After multiple attempts to join the Armed Forces were thwarted by residency laws, she joined the Royal Navy Reserves.She now works at RAF Cosford training engineering officers in aerodynamics, thermodynamics and engineering mathematics.In her spare time she is an ambassador for the Royal Navy, visiting schools to promote engineering and inspire students, especially young girls.All this was made possible through her determination to follow her dreams – and serve in uniform.She said: “I am too stubborn to give up. The day I wore my uniform it was a massive glow of pride. I had earned it because I have stretched myself – the Reserves have stretched me.“When I did my passing out parade I was the most happiest person on Earth.”Best innovationAircraft Handling Warrant Officer PAUL MOONANAT a time of cutbacks, Warrant Officer Paul Moonan saved the MoD £4.5million – thanks to a brainwave.Britain’s new carrier HMS Queen ­Elizabeth has four acres of aircraft deck.42 Paul Moonan 's idea for adapting a tractor to fight fires has saved millions of poundsIf an aircraft bursts into flames, the only way to propel water or foam on to the blaze is from a fire-fighting vehicle.American carriers use purpose-built fire-fighters costing £500,000 each, but Royal Navy WO1 Paul, 48, was convinced there was a better – and much cheaper – way to keep aircrew safe.The father-of-two from Fareham, Hants, is married to Suzanne and joined the Royal Navy nearly 30 years ago. He spent much of his career on aircraft car-riers Ark Royal, Illustrious and Invincible.Now working in military procurement, Paul was convinced a tractor already used to move aircraft on board could be adapted to also become a fire vehicle.He took a huge gamble and approached the tractor’s creator DFS of Halifax, West Yorks, and its engineers invented a module for the existing vehicles that included tanks to carry 450litres of water and 60litres of foam.HMS Queen Elizabeth will now carry nine tractors, three of which will be ­fitted with the fire-fighting module. Paul says: “If a tractor fails, we have spares and it takes roughly three hours to convert an aircraft mover into a fire-fighter.”Sniper technologyTHE Army’s current rifle system allows snipers to achieve precision shots over ­significant distances.Successful shots at night can be more challenging, though.42 A sniper rifle with the new night-vision scope will give sharpshooters the edge in battleBut thanks to a team at the MoD, ­British snipers will have the edge with an ­amazing new sighting system that offers improved night-vision images.Developed by scientists at the Defence Science and Technology ­Laboratory with industry partners, it has significantly improved night-vision images.Snipers, who were involved throughout the tech’s development, have confirmed it gives us a massive advantage, with one military adviser saying: “This gives the modern sniper a persistent 24-hour capability, regardless of background light levels.”UK defence companies Leonardo, Qioptiq and Insitu developed the ­concept and took it to the Army, who tested it in live trials. They found the new sight has better magnification and resolution, so snipers could easily make out targets, even in darkness.One extra feature is new image matching software, which allows the spotter to take a picture of the target, and this is automatically matched with the image in the shooter’s sight.This means they can agree on the ­target quickly and don’t need to use revealing markers, such as lasers.Harris T7 bomb disposal robotOUR world-renowned bomb hunters will have a new comrade in the fight against deadly improvised explosive devices – the Harris T7 robot.The tracked robots will soon replace the Wheelbarrow droid, used extensively in Afghanistan, to investigate and disarm deadly devices.42 The T7 robot is viewed as a game-changer for safety in bomb disposalEquipped with digital cameras, ­lightning-fast datalinks, an adjustable manipulation arm and tough all-terrain treads, the robots are able to neutralise a wide range of threats.The MoD is spending £55million on 56 of these remarkable robots, which have human-like arms that can be operated from a safe distance with a remote- control handgrip.Its precision control and dexterity cuts completion time and improves mission effectiveness.A variety of attachments enable the use of standard-issue sensors, disruptors and tools that support a wide range of missions, including Hazmat – hazardous materials clean-up – and the ability to disable IEDs planted inside vehicles.Sacha Spragg, Project Manager at Defence Equipment and Support, which is acquiring the system, said: “The Harris T7 is a game-changer for the ­British Army. It will take bomb disposal tasks to the next level in confidence and control.” Top brass and stars on panelTO celebrate a decade of the Millies, a new judging panel has been assembled.Additions this year include former chiefs Admiral Sir George Zambellas, General The Lord Richards, General Sir Richard Barrons and Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford.42 TOP ROW, left to right: Andy McNab, Lord Richards, Jeremy Clarkson, Penny Lancaster, Sir Andrew Pulford.

It is a phenomenal accolade for us.”The Jon Egging TrustNATHAN HOLLAND was a troubled teenager who had been excluded from school ten times.But four years later, he was voted head boy at his school, studied ­business at college and has begun work as a trainee accountant.And three months ago the boy who avoided games at school ran the 13-mile Great North Run alongside Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Stephen ­Hillier.43 Nathan Holland, bottom right, takes a selfie with Sir Stephen ­Hillier, centre. Holland turned his life around thanks to the Jon Egging TrustMuch of the credit for Nathan’s transformation is due to the Jon Egging Trust (JET), set up in the name of a Red Arrows pilot who died during a Bournemouth air display.In just five years this remarkable charity has helped change the lives of 10,000 under-achieving young people like Nathan, 19, from Downham Market, Norfolk, by introducing them to military volunteers who can inspire teenagers to do well.Teenagers on the JET Blue Skies ­programme spend time over three years visiting RAF, Navy and MoD bases, learning from military ­personnel who pass on skills and, above all, fire ­enthusiasm into the kids.43 The charity has helped thousands of youngstersFlt Lt Jon Egging, 33, from Rutland, was experiencing more than six times G-Force in his Hawk Jet T1 jet Red 4 when he lost consciousness and crashed at Eastbourne in August 2011.His widow, Dr Emma Egging, 38, who now works as JET’s chief executive, said: “When Jon became part of the Red Arrows he understood the power of the red suit as a magnet to engage and inspire.""After his death it felt like a natural step to set up a charity that was the ethos of Jon, the ethos of the RAF, the Reds and the military.""Jon would be incredibly proud of being nominated.”Best reservist nomineesCorporal PHILIP KEOGH, 355 Medical Evacuation UnitWHEN Salman Abedi detonated his suicide bomb at the Manchester Arena, paramedic Philip Keogh was on night duty miles from the city.Controllers asked him to return to Rochdale ambulance station and await further instructions as the terror attack unfolded.43 Sense of duty . . .  Philip’s instincts are to help those in needBut father-of-two Philip, 40, is also a Reservist Army medic who has treated bomb victims at Camp Bastion in ­Afghanistan.Believing his specialist military expertise would be needed, he drove his rapid response vehicle towards Manchester, where dozens of victims — many of them young girls — had been maimed.For his actions, Philip has been shortlisted for Best Reservist in the Millies.Now in their tenth year, The Sun Military Awards shine a spotlight on incredible acts of gallantry and grit.London News Pictures43 Traumatic scenes . . . the wounded after the Manchester arena bombingPhilip, a Corporal with the Manchester-based 355 Medical Evacuation Unit, says: “Before they said to go to Manchester, I was already on my way.“One of the strange memories of that ­evening for me was the drive there. My legs just felt really funny because the adrenaline was pumping.“I was thinking that maybe I could help out a little bit more because I’d been in Afghanistan and done the training, through the battle courses the military do.“One of my bosses, Dan Smith, said I should go and start doing triage in and around Victoria train station.”PA:Press Association43 In May, a homemade bomb was detonated as concert-goers were leaving Manchester ArenaBecause of the ongoing inquiry into the bombing, in which 22 people died and 250 were wounded, Philip cannot reveal too much detail about his part in the horrific events of May 22.But such was the scale of the devastation — and the extent to which emergency services were stretched — that he was soon drawing on all his military training to save lives.Despite the threat of a second bomb, he identified the injured and prioritised them for treatment.Realising that patient evacuation was becoming an issue, Philip took charge by coordinating the stretcher lift of patients.He worked tirelessly as part of a large team of rescuers to control the scene, detailing crews to undertake treatment and delivering life-saving care himself.PA:Press Association43 A tribute left to the victims in the wake of the bombingHis dedication, bravery and calm in the chaos saved numerous lives.Philip says: “I have a strong sense of duty to the community that I live with and that I work for.“I joined the reserve as a medic because I like to help people, to serve and to make a difference.“We do what we do and we do our job at great personal cost. It’s not just physical but the psychological damage we endure because we, as ordinary people doing extraordinary things, have to endure some very nasty sights.“People touched by the events in ­Manchester will always carry that scar with them. I know I will.”On being nominated for a Millie, he adds: “It’s quite humbling to be nominated for something which I feel is part of my job.“In some ways, I feel the recognition it has brought me is undeserved because it is for something that should never have happened.“Countless people, not just ambulance, fire police and civilians, played their part in the aftermath. I have never been prouder to be a Mancunian.”Lieutenant Commander IAIN BEATON, Maritime Trade Operations BranchFOUR reservists, led by Lieutenant ­Commander Beaton, play a crucial role in keeping perilous shipping routes in the Middle East safe from pirates and drug smugglers.Based in Dubai, this small but vital unit uses military and commercial information to operate a 24-hour advice service to merchant ships.43 Iain Beaton is helping to keep important shipping routes safeThe team, who have left their jobs, families and friends for the two-year posting, also coordinate rescue missions when things go wrong.Like on the evening of April 8 this year, when the master of the bulk carrier OS35 reported that his 600ft ship had been boarded by pirates in the Gulf of Aden. Iain, 51, from Edinburgh, and his team discovered that the crew of 19 Syrians had locked themselves in the ship’s strong room. Meanwhile, the pirates were trying to smoke them out.Iain said: “A merchant ship nearby saw the OS35 was on fire and went towards the ship to try to help.“I was screaming down the phone to the company’s security officer, ‘Don’t let your ship go anywhere near’. So they stood off and reported everything they could see.”Next morning five military vessels, including ships from the Chinese and Indian navies, arrived.Using Iain’s information, the crew was ­rescued and the pirates’ crew arrested. Former bank manager Iain added of his nomination: “To my mind it’s really a team honour rather than an individual.”Squadron Leader SUE SHILLADAY, Bridlington Sea CadetsSQUADRON Leader Sue Shilladay has been a tireless servant of the Cadet Force for decades – and a trailblazer. She joined in 1978, becoming one of the first women to be ­commissioned into Bridlington School Combined Cadet Force.She was also its first female ­Contingent Commander and fought for female recruits to be treated equally. However she initially had to fight prejudice, too.43 Sue Shilladay has inspired thousands of young peopleShe says: “I refused to participate in the first RAF camp for girls. It was arranged as a single-sex camp with a programme made easier for girls.“Instead, we went to the mixed Army camp.” During her long career Sue, from Bridlington, has inspired more than 5,000 youngsters with the best qualities of the Armed Forces – self-confidence, leadership skills, teamwork and social responsibility.She says: “I was responsible for both male and female cadets but my role allowed girl cadets to see that they could aspire to ­membership of the Armed Forces.”One of Sue’s proudest moments was taking a group of youngsters on a live firing exercise in the Mediterranean on board HMS Gloucester.The ship’s captain was one of her former cadets.Of her Millies nod Sue says: “I’m quite overwhelmed. I see it as a ­recognition of the contribution of all those who work with cadets.”One cadet said: “Sue really is an incredibly inspirational leader.”Hero at home: IndividualPetty Officer TOBY JONES, HMS TyneAS flood water thundered around him and nitrogen turned the air toxic last April, Petty Officer Jones knew he had to close a door to contain a leak that ­threatened lives on board HMS Tyne.But it also meant condemning his mate Rob Knott to almost certain death.Simon Jones - The Sun43 Petty Officer Toby Jones faced a hard decision between preventing a toxic leak and saving his friendPetty Officer Jones, 40, a married dad- of-two from Emsworth, Hants, said: “Rob is a good friend of mine. You hope you never have to make that decision.”Catastrophe struck while the ship was docked at Faslane, HM Naval Base Clyde.A fire exercise triggered a water leak in the internal fire extinguisher system. Meanwhile nitrogen, designed to stop a fire spreading, was seeping in.Toby Jones shares his amazing story of bravery ahead of the Sun Military AwardsWith PO Knott inside, he ordered everyone out and closed the hatch.PO Jones then took the breathing apparatus from another sailor and went back into the room.He said: “It was pitch black. You couldn’t see anything – just water splashing into your face.”Eventually he found his friend lying lifeless and not breathing, and dragged him out up a flight of stairs.Toby said: “As the oxygen started to get back into his body, he gave what I can only describe as a life breath.Simon Jones - The Sun43 Jones went back into the toxic room to rescue his friend“It was one of those harrowing sounds I will never be able to forget.“Closing the door, condemning a man, it was harrowing.""You hope no one has to go through that. But we all got out alive.”Lt JARED BAMBRIDGE 1st Battalion The ­Yorkshire RegimentWHEN a terror trio struck at the heart of London, off-duty soldier Jared Bambridge ran into the carnage – while everyone else was fleeing for their lives.The young lieutenant was walking home from a theatre trip with his girlfriend when Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba carried out their attack by London Bridge.MOD_CROWN 201743 Jared Bambridge saved many lives during the night of the London Bridge terror attackThey killed eight people and injured 48 others on June 3 – but the death toll would have been higher were it not for Lt Bambridge, 23.He treated around ten injured people, saving multiple lives.He said: “It wasn’t a pleasant thing to happen, but I am really glad that I was there and able to help people.”Jared, from York, first went to the aid of a 51-year-old man with blood gushing from two stab wounds.As he applied pressure to the injuries, bursts of gunfire rang out.Using his first aid training, he spent two hours treating four more bleeding casualties and helped more to safety outside the safety cordon – all despite an ongoing bomb threat.MOD_CROWN 201743 Jared remains humble, despite his heroic actions on the night of the attackHe said: “There were so many people lending hands.

I saw the driver was still in the car – which was smoking.”A red Corsa had careered off the country lane, smashed through the tree line, flipped over and was about to burst into flames.MOD43 Lindsay Clarke and Vicki Keats leaped into action to save a man from a burning carCpl Keats said: “We tried to pull him out but we couldn’t, so Lindsay got inside.”L/Cpl Clarke added: “I got in ­underneath him, took his seatbelt off and I sort of got him on to my shoulder and pushed him out of the car.“At that point Vicki had his arm so I had to get around him and we dragged him over the side of the car to get him out.”The pair, both based at RAF Benson, Oxfordshire, estimate the car caught fire less than a minute after they got the driver, a young carer, free.They administered first aid until emergency services arrived. Police praised the pair’s “moral fibre” for intervening at enormous risk to their own lives.L/Cpl Clarke, said: “It was Army ­training kicking in – it was about getting that guy out of there.”Hero at home: UnitSOUTHERN DIVING UNIT 2, Royal NavyWHEN Portsmouth Harbour was dredged to make way for new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, more than five tonnes of Nazi bombs were hauled up from the seabed.Decades on from the Luftwaffe’s ­Second World War aerial bombardment of the seaport, the unexploded devices were once again threatening the city.And the fearless frogmen of Southern Diving Unit 2 were there to save the day.MOD43 A member of Southern Diving Unit 2 making sure an unexploded bomb is made safeLieutenant Commander Jonny ­Campbell, Officer in Charge of the unit, said: “Purely from the amount of ­ordnance dropped or deployed during World War Two, we knew we were going to have our hands full.“The grit and effort shown by the team was formidable.”The Portsmouth-based unit, just 25 strong, has responded to 34 major alerts since dredging began two years ago.Every time the dredge crew found something, the divers would swim down into the murky waters to explore it. If it was a decaying device – liable to blow at any time – the harbour would be closed and the explosives dragged out to sea and detonated.Lt Cdr Campbell said: “It is a sense of fulfilment that you are making the ­Channel safer and almost paving the way for the aircraft carrier which is the future of the Royal Navy. It is great.”HMS St ALBANS, Royal NavyTHE UK’s on-call warship has been ready to react to any threat in British waters at a moment’s notice.HMS St Albans and her crew of 200 have circumnavigated the country multiple times, guarding us from threats.CROWN43 HMS St Albans, at the bottom of the picture, escorts two Russian warshipsThey were never more tested than when a Russian aircraft carrier and other ships sailed up the English Channel.As President Putin’s flotilla steamed within miles of our coast, HMS St Albans shadowed her every move.Commander Chris Ansell said: “You see people at their best when they are doing something that they have been trained for. But it was not a surprise.“We track these things all the time and we are prepared for these things.”The price of miscalculation was enormous but, thanks to the Navy’s man-marking job, the Russians passed safely.Cdr Ansell said: “You can count on several hands the sorts of things that could happen either deliberately or by accident, particularly with ageing bits of hardware using busy shipping lanes.“We certainly felt very happy that it was a job well done at the end of it.”He added: “The crew have far exceeded my expectations and my expectations were pretty high.”On the crew being nominated for a ­Millie, he says: “The whole ship’s ­company is over the moon.”MILITARY CO-RESPONDERS with South Central Ambulance ServiceHUNDREDS of serving troops volunteer their time to back ambulance service comrades saving lives in a Herculean job largely unseen by the public.One such scheme is bolstering the vital work of the South Central ­Ambulance Service right now, with amazing results.Between September and August, ­Military Co-Responders attended 5,626 incidents, conducting an impressive 2,496 volunteering shifts.UK MOD43 Military Co-Responders at RAF Halton in Buckinghamshire.

She said: ­“Conditions were worse than we would ever think about putting the boat out in. We were in gale force winds, 50mph at times, and 18ft waves.”Despite the danger, LS Hughes along with bowman AB Kyle Porteous and the ship’s PT instructor Ryan Billington made 13 approaches over a gruelling two-hour period to lift all the crew off the stricken yacht and ferry them back to HMS Dragon 800 yards away.During one run, waves crashed the smaller rescue boat into the side of HMS Dragon and LS Hughes injured her arm but continued the rescue.She said: “I just think that day I was doing my job and all 14 people got to go back to their families. It’s enough for me to know that I did my job well.”Sgt KIRSTY LYON-TAYLOR, 4626 Sqdn, RAF Brize NortonRESERVIST nurse Kirsty Lyon-Taylor helped save the heroine behind the film I Dreamed of Africa.Animal campaigner and conservationist Kuki Gallmann, 74, who was played by Kim Basinger in the movie, was shot twice in the stomach by raiders at her ranch in Kenya in April.43 Kirsty Lyon-Taylor helped save the life of a famous conservationistShe was being accompanied off her ranch by armed wildlife rangers when one spotted three people.Before she could turn, a shot hit Kuki “like a punch in the lower abdomen” as she sat in the driver’s seat of her open-backed Land Cruiser.She fell sideways and felt another bullet tear through her guts before the rangers chased the ambushers away.Kuki rang to ask for a neighbour’s helicopter which took her to British Army medics at the Training Unit Kenya base. Among those waiting to give Kuki a blood transfusion and staunch the bleeding during a life-or-death flight to Nairobi was reservist Medical Emergency Response Team nurse Kirsty Lyon-Taylor, 35.She said: “Caring for the patient as a tight two-person team was frenetic.“It was only when she was safely delivered to hospital that I realised how much I’d been working and doing to save the patient’s life.”While she was recovering Kuki contacted the military medical team. Kirsty, from Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, says: “She sent us a very kind message thanking us for our efforts to help her.

He wasn’t in his life jacket and had obviously drowned.”As they were about to pull the victim from the water a merchant ship nearby spotted a survivor.Stu says: “In harness, I was lowered down into the water and got hit by 30ft waves, nearly as high as a house.“I managed to swim over and ­reassure him when I was hit by a wave. I was upside down in the water on the wire and had to let go of the guy.“The crew lifted me out of the water and we lowered a strop down without me in it and the guy managed to get in it and we lifted him out.”Hero overseas: UnitHMS MONMOUTH, Royal NavyHMS Monmouth and her crew have spent this year on maritime security operations, policing the high seas. They pulled off a helicopter rescue and a major drugs bust.On March 6, Commander Ian Feasey and his crew of 225 set sail for the ­Middle East, returning in December, after patrolling though the Arabian Gulf, Red Sea and Indian Ocean. In June, they received a mayday ­signal from a vessel in the Indian Ocean, 400 miles east of Somalia.43 The crew of HMS Monmouth display the busted drugsThe vessel had sunk in a storm and one sailor remained in the water. HMS Monmouth launched her ­chopper and rescued the last crew member.Cdr Feasey, said: “Our winch man managed to pluck the Indian sailor from the water in a 40ft swell in an oil slick with seconds to spare before the aircraft had to return for lack of fuel.”Soon they were back in the policing role – spending two days tracking a fishing dhow feared to be ferrying drugs. Cdr Feasey added: “When we got on board, the chaps moved about three tonnes of ice from a fish hold and, in a hidden compartment, found three quarters of a tonne of drugs. The haul, worth £65million, was headed to Britain.Talking about the nomination, Cdr Feasey said: “When I told the ship’s ­company [of the Millies nomination] they were overwhelmed. This makes them feel extremely ­valued for all the hard work they put in.”1st BATTALION, Royal Irish RegimentTHE Rangers of 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment were despatched to Kabul on a mission to keep the peace.In May, they were called out when an IS suicide car bomber targeted a Nato convoy, leaving scores injured.43 The Royal Irish Regiment have helped prevent casualties in dramatic situationsMajor Paul Martin, Officer Commanding B Company, said: “There were a number of Afghan civilians killed and wounded and clearly a few of their vehicles were damaged.”Later this year, Kabul was rocked by a massive blast outside the German Embassy that killed roughly 150 Afghan civilians and wounded more than 600.Maj Martin said: “When something of that magnitude, size and scale in that area goes off, everything is sort of exposed and a lot of people are in a lot of distress.“We saved the lives of quite a few of the Afghan security workers and we also helped to extract around four of the most seriously wounded from the German Embassy.”Around 250 Royal Irish troops deployed between December 2016 and last August to Kabul, training Afghan ­security forces and standing ready to react to emergencies.Without their rapid reaction times and extremely professional conduct, the number of casualties in both incidents could have been much higher.Maj Martin added: “I will clearly be biased but the guys worked flawlessly throughout.”UK REAPER FORCE, RAFFEARSOME Reaper drones are saving lives every day in the fight against IS.Crews operating from bases at RAF Waddington and America’s Creech Air Base in Nevada have been flying ­continuous missions as part of ­Operation Shader since October 2014.Darren Fletcher - The Sun43 Two drone pilots sit safely at their controlsThe officer commanding 13 Sqn, UK Reaper force, whose identity we are protecting, told The Sun: “Reaper has been ­central to every major engagement in the Shader campaign.”Recently over Mosul, Iraq, a Reaper crew protecting advancing friendly Iraqi security forces spotted a heavily armoured suicide bomb truck emerge from under the cover of a building.The Reaper’s Hellfire missile achieved a direct hit on the bomb truck seconds before it would have detonated.In another incident, a Reaper crew took out an IS sniper guarding a public execution in Abu Kamal, Syria, in May.

I found the first couple of days really challenging — it was not so much the physical exertion, it was the sleep.“And it was terrifying, the waves were massive. From the word go we had a large side swell, so that was scary.”But the challenge awakened something in Lee that he thought was gone — demonstrating the inspirational power of adventure.He added: “It sounds trite that I went on a journey to discover myself, but it really was that.“It was the single most important and positive thing to happen to me.“I’m incredibly proud of being part of it, massively proud.”Former Snr Aircraftman LUKE WIGMAN, and ­former Captain IBI ALI, Yorkshire RegimentWOUNDED war heroes Ibi Ali and Luke Wigman conquered one of the toughest running races on the planet – the World Marathon Challenge.RAF paratrooper Luke, 31, of Nottingham, was serving with the crack Special ­Forces Support Group when he ­suffered horrific leg injuries in a bomb blast in Helmand, Afghanistan in 2011.43 The pair ran in Antarctica as part of the World Marathon ChallengeAnd decorated former Army officer Ibi, 40, from York, lost part of his right arm to a roadside bomb in Iraq in 2007.But together they ran seven marathons in seven days on seven continents to raise almost £1million for a new rehabilitation centre for injured and sick troops. Starting in Antarctica, the pair then ran consecutive 26.2mile races in Chile, Miami, Madrid, Marrakech, Dubai and Sydney in less than a week.Determined Ibi became the first amputee to complete the challenge while Luke completed the race in the third fastest time ever.They did it all for the new £300million Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre (DNRC), being completed right now in Loughborough, Leics, ready to open next October.43 The two raised almost £1million by running seven marathons in seven days on seven continentsIbi said: “The DNRC is going to be epic. I don’t think people will get the full scale of it until it opens its doors.“I want to allow servicemen and women who haven’t even been born yet to have the best level of care.”In total the pair ran 183.4 miles and flew for 59 hours covering 27,000miles in a week.When they started in Antarctica an international stop clock began, ­counting down the 168 hours the ­runners had to complete the challenge.On being nominated Luke said: “We don’t do these things for a pat on the back or to boost our own ego, we do it to make a difference.“But when someone recognises you along the way, it’s an incredible feeling.”Officer Cadet PADMAJA ‘PIYA’ DAS, Royal Navy ReservesPLUCKY Reservist Das has repeatedly beaten the odds to realise her dream of serving in the Armed Forces.But the Officer Cadet, 26, of Telford, Shrops, has had to obliterate stereotypes and cultural, religious and gender barriers to make it happen.43 Reservist Padmaja beams with pride in her armed forces uniformPiya came to the UK from West Bengal aged 11 in 2002, when her dad moved here with work.It was a seismic shock. She recalled: “I had left my friends, my family and everything back in India. I could not speak English, I could not make friends. There was a lot of taunting, which changed into bullying.”She found her solace in studying.After completing GCSEs and A Levels in maths, further maths, physics and economics she achieved a BTEC in electronic engineering while working part time in Primark.While studying aerospace engineering at university she also worked night shifts at Debenhams to pay the fees.Piya then achieved a masters in the same subject and after 138 job applications was employed as a specialist instructor at the Engineering School, HMS Sultan. After multiple attempts to join the Armed Forces were thwarted by residency laws, she joined the Royal Navy Reserves.She now works at RAF Cosford training engineering officers in aerodynamics, thermodynamics and engineering mathematics.In her spare time she is an ambassador for the Royal Navy, visiting schools to promote engineering and inspire students, especially young girls.All this was made possible through her determination to follow her dreams – and serve in uniform.She said: “I am too stubborn to give up. The day I wore my uniform it was a massive glow of pride. I had earned it because I have stretched myself – the Reserves have stretched me.“When I did my passing out parade I was the most happiest person on Earth.”Best innovationAircraft Handling Warrant Officer PAUL MOONANAT a time of cutbacks, Warrant Officer Paul Moonan saved the MoD £4.5million – thanks to a brainwave.Britain’s new carrier HMS Queen ­Elizabeth has four acres of aircraft deck.43 Paul Moonan 's idea for adapting a tractor to fight fires has saved millions of poundsIf an aircraft bursts into flames, the only way to propel water or foam on to the blaze is from a fire-fighting vehicle.American carriers use purpose-built fire-fighters costing £500,000 each, but Royal Navy WO1 Paul, 48, was convinced there was a better – and much cheaper – way to keep aircrew safe.The father-of-two from Fareham, Hants, is married to Suzanne and joined the Royal Navy nearly 30 years ago. He spent much of his career on aircraft car-riers Ark Royal, Illustrious and Invincible.Now working in military procurement, Paul was convinced a tractor already used to move aircraft on board could be adapted to also become a fire vehicle.He took a huge gamble and approached the tractor’s creator DFS of Halifax, West Yorks, and its engineers invented a module for the existing vehicles that included tanks to carry 450litres of water and 60litres of foam.HMS Queen Elizabeth will now carry nine tractors, three of which will be ­fitted with the fire-fighting module. Paul says: “If a tractor fails, we have spares and it takes roughly three hours to convert an aircraft mover into a fire-fighter.”Sniper technologyTHE Army’s current rifle system allows snipers to achieve precision shots over ­significant distances.Successful shots at night can be more challenging, though.43 A sniper rifle with the new night-vision scope will give sharpshooters the edge in battleBut thanks to a team at the MoD, ­British snipers will have the edge with an ­amazing new sighting system that offers improved night-vision images.Developed by scientists at the Defence Science and Technology ­Laboratory with industry partners, it has significantly improved night-vision images.Snipers, who were involved throughout the tech’s development, have confirmed it gives us a massive advantage, with one military adviser saying: “This gives the modern sniper a persistent 24-hour capability, regardless of background light levels.”UK defence companies Leonardo, Qioptiq and Insitu developed the ­concept and took it to the Army, who tested it in live trials. They found the new sight has better magnification and resolution, so snipers could easily make out targets, even in darkness.One extra feature is new image matching software, which allows the spotter to take a picture of the target, and this is automatically matched with the image in the shooter’s sight.This means they can agree on the ­target quickly and don’t need to use revealing markers, such as lasers.Harris T7 bomb disposal robotOUR world-renowned bomb hunters will have a new comrade in the fight against deadly improvised explosive devices – the Harris T7 robot.The tracked robots will soon replace the Wheelbarrow droid, used extensively in Afghanistan, to investigate and disarm deadly devices.43 The T7 robot is viewed as a game-changer for safety in bomb disposalEquipped with digital cameras, ­lightning-fast datalinks, an adjustable manipulation arm and tough all-terrain treads, the robots are able to neutralise a wide range of threats.The MoD is spending £55million on 56 of these remarkable robots, which have human-like arms that can be operated from a safe distance with a remote- control handgrip.Its precision control and dexterity cuts completion time and improves mission effectiveness.A variety of attachments enable the use of standard-issue sensors, disruptors and tools that support a wide range of missions, including Hazmat – hazardous materials clean-up – and the ability to disable IEDs planted inside vehicles.Sacha Spragg, Project Manager at Defence Equipment and Support, which is acquiring the system, said: “The Harris T7 is a game-changer for the ­British Army. It will take bomb disposal tasks to the next level in confidence and control.”Inspiring othersSpear 17, ArmySPEAR 17 became the first all-British military team to complete a full, unsupported traverse of ­Antarctica.The record-breaking outfit of Army reservists, led by Parachute Regiment Captain Lou Rudd, trekked 1,100 miles in 67 days to conquer the toughest terrain on the planet.43 Ice guys  . . .  Alun George, Alex Brazier, Lou Rudd, Ollie Stoten, James Facer-Childs, Chris BrookeTheir superhuman expedition was the brainchild of Capt Rudd, who wanted to raise the profile of the Reserves, raise money for charity and honour his fallen mate Henry Worsley.Worsley — an SAS officer and explorer — died in January 2016 while attempting the first solo crossing of the Antarctic.The full team was made up of expedition leader Lou, 48, plus Reservist doctors Ollie Stoten and Alex Brazier, both 27, James Facer-Childs, another Reserves doctor, 30, paramedic Chris Brooke, 35, and Alun George, 43, who left the Reserves in 2017.They set out on the first leg of their 730-mile trek to the South Pole in November 2016 — reaching their target in just 40 days, in time for Christmas Day.43 Spear 17's Ollie Stoten experienced the severe effects of the coldAfter taking on a resupply of fuel and provisions, and sadly having to say goodbye to Alun who was deemed medically unfit to continue, the second leg took them another 400 miles.It was gruelling going, tramping for ten hours a day non-stop, in temperatures touching minus 53C, hauling 165kg of gear on sleds through a polar wilderness.When they reached the location Henry got to, they paused for a moving remembrance service.The team conquered the harsh weather, crevasses, isolation from the outside world and constant mental and physical rigours.43 The team trekked 1,100 miles across AntarticaAnd they did it to raise funds for ABF The Soldiers’ Charity.Capt Rudd was full of praise for his team, saying: “It was an incredible performance to go from zero to hero.”Captain UMESH PUN, Army Reserve Signals UnitCAPTAIN Pun is an inspiration to the Gurkha community at home and abroad. He joined the Gurkhas aged 17 in 1979 and is still serving today.In recent years Capt Pun, 56, a dad-of-three, has been fundamental in establishing The Gurkha Homes Project for veterans.43 Captain Pun's project helped Gurkha veterans who wanted to settle in the UKAfter actress Joanna Lumley’s high-profile campaign to allow Gurkha veterans to settle in the UK, many veterans wanted to take up the offer.Capt Pun, who served in ­Bosnia, Sierra Leone and Afghanistan, said: “The problem is with the housing and language. So I came up with the Homes Project.”Now 26 couples are housed in Colchester, thanks to Capt Pun. And he has confirmed a £1m investment to build a second home for Gurkhas in Kent.His heroic efforts are also in action abroad. As in 2015 he was on the ground in Nepal within days of the earthquake.He went on to help build a school for 350 children.Capt Pun explains: “I came from a very poor background, so I always feel if I can make someone happy, I’ll be happy.”Chief Petty Officer ANDY ‘GIBBO’ GIBBSANDY ‘Gibbo’ Gibbs is a one-man fundraising machine.The tireless sailor, 47, of Chinnor, Oxfordshire, has single-handedly collected more than half a million pounds for Sun-backed military charity Help for Heroes.43 One-man fundraising machine . . . Chief Petty Officer GibbsChief Petty Officer Gibbo, based at HMS Collingwood in Fareham, Hants, who joined the Royal Navy aged 16, revealed his fundraising ­odyssey was hatched over a beer on a beach with a ­comrade. He said: “We were coming back from the Far East and decided we wanted to do something for the guys that were wounded in Afghanistan.“We started out to raise ten grand by walking across ­Scotland. We made £14,000 in one event and got the bug.”From there Gibbo took collection buckets to concerts and sports games. He has also walked more than 1,000 miles in aid of charity – all on top of his day job. CPO Gibbo was delighted by his Millies ­nomination, saying: “It’s just ­amazing. I was gobsmacked when I was told. You could have knocked me over with a feather.”Top brass and stars on panelTO celebrate a decade of the Millies, a new judging panel has been assembled.Additions this year include former chiefs Admiral Sir George Zambellas, General The Lord Richards, General Sir Richard Barrons and Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford.43 TOP ROW, left to right: Andy McNab, Lord Richards, Jeremy Clarkson, Penny Lancaster, Sir Andrew Pulford.

Malaysia is one of the most culturally diverse places in the world.The only problem is actually finding enough time to fit it all in. With so much on offer and only ten days to see it, I decide a backpacking option is best.9 Energetic travellers can get their kicks hiking Malaysia's mountainsIt’s quick, convenient and in tropical climates there’s really nothing more than a good book and passport that I actually need.I start in the north. Langkawi island.It’s a honeymoon-cum-hippie hotspot that’s a magnet for couples and solo travellers.And if palm trees, lazy days on the beach and pink sunsets are your thing, then it’s a place for you too. I saved a tidy sum with Norwegian Air’s low-cost long haul Gatwick to Singapore route at just £368 return, before catching one of the dozens of daily flights to Malaysia for as little as £20 one-way.Getty - Contributor9 Kuala Lumpur is an international city recognised by UNESCO for its vibranceAnd after more than 18 hours of travelling, Langkawi is a well-earned pit stop in paradise.I book into the quirky Tubotel, where £18 gets me a double room in a giant concrete “tube” with a private balcony and patio doors that open right on to the sea.The hotel oozes charm and attracts a laidback crowd who laze around on the daybeds enjoying a sunset to die for.It’s also a short skip to Cenang Beach, the island’s biggest and most impressive beach. It’s the main tourist hub of the island, but boasts enough beach bars and budget-friendly restaurants to keep it from feeling overcrowded. For the adventurous, you can take the Langkawi Cable Car to enjoy panoramic views 650 metres above sea level.Getty - Contributor9 Buddhist and Hindu temples of incredible beauty are littered across the countryNumerous rainforest walks can be completed in a few hours and Telaga Tujuh waterfalls is well worth a visit.The following day, recharged and reenergised, I head to my next destination, George Town.Regularly topping many travel guides’ “must visit” destination lists, George Town is an explosion of food, charm, food, sightseeing, food and history.The city’s three main districts of Little India, Chinatown and the Colonial District overlap in a maze of sights, smells and sounds that is best explored on foot.In 2008 it was declared a Unesco World Heritage Site for having “unique architectural and cultural townscape without parallel anywhere in East and Southeast Asia”. High praise.It sparked a facelift but maintained its age-old feel.Getty - Contributor9 Malaysia is home to stunning architecture, beautiful landscapes and often both at the same timeSome of the world’s best street art merges with Chinese clanhouses. Stunning Hindu temples are sandwiched between archetypal colonial hotels.And running throughout every corner of George Town are outstanding street food stalls, hawkers, cafes and restaurants. Locals come here from all over Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand just to eat. Even if you thought you came here for another reason, your priorities might change dramatically once you tuck into the Indian, Chinese, Malay and various hybrid treats.Try fiery laska curry, popiah spring rolls or lip-smacking char kway teow noodles and wash down with a thick mango lassi, then take a leisurely wander around the museums, galleries and boutique shops.I could easily stay a week in George Town and never run out of things to do, but the clock’s ticking and my next destination awaits. For £4 I bag a seat on an air-conditioned coach heading east to the Cameron Highlands.9 Watch out for the monkeys - they come right up to tourists at the temples where they hang outThe cool tea plantations are a welcome respite from the sweaty humidity of lowland Malaysia.The Highlands’ two main towns are Tanah Rata and Brinchang, with strawberry farms, butterfly farms, honey bee farms, tea houses and market stalls dotted along the winding country road that separates them.Buses run regularly between the two towns making it easy to hop on and hop off, while locals are also accustomed to hikers along the route too.Guesthouses and B&Bs are plentiful in Tanah Rata and prices for a private double room start from around £10 per night. A good night’s sleep is imperative for the next part of my journey as I make a seven-hour journey to Taman Negara, the oldest rainforest on Earth.Estimated to be more than 130million years old, this national park is the jewel of Malaysia tropical landscape.9 The skyline is iconic - in particular the twin Petronas towersThe shadowy, near-impregnable jungle is home to tigers, elephants and leopards as well all sorts of snakes, insects and birds.From Cameron Highlands I paid £12 for another perfectly comfortable coach ride to small town Jerantut — the gateway to the jungle.From here it’s a two-hour riverboat ride up the winding river to Kuala Tahan, where floating restaurants, backpacker lodges and the wilderness combines.Trekking is what brings folk here and I can’t wait to explore, while you can also book tours to meet the native Orang Asli tribe, night safari or jungle walk.Numerous travel operators within Kuala Tahan offer one or multi-day hikes, while those brave enough can head off on one of the many well-trodden trails.I take the latter option and choose a nine-hour trek through tiger homeland.Getty - Contributor9 Kuala Lumpur's streets are famed for their cultural diversity, bustle and street artTo my great relief I don’t bump into any big cats, however the views from peaks at Bukit Terisek and Bukit Luas are worth the grind while there’s plenty of smaller wildlife along the route to enjoy.The next day I swapped the wild jungle for the concrete one in Kuala Lumpur.The once quiet colonial base has evolved into a 21st century metropolis famed for its remarkable cultural diversity.From the soaring Petronas Towers to the 272-step psychedelic Batu Caves, the sweeping skyline views from Lake Titiwangsa to its shop ’til you drop malls the city has it all.And during two days in Kuala Lumpur, I found myself eating at their famous Jalan Alor street markets four times.You can sample pretty much every Malay-Chinese, Indian, Thai or seafood dish imaginable.Getty - Contributor9 The streets turn into a heaving buffet of local food after dark with every Malay-Chinese, Indian or Thai dish imaginableMOST READ IN TRAVELTHOMAS SHOOK What are my rights if Thomas Cook goes bust after I've booked my holiday?

And it turned the match.Reuters8 Chelsea celebrate Alvaro Morata's goal to give them the leadHazard got angry but channeled his frustration into a spellbinding virtuoso half hour performance in which Chelsea went out and won the game.On 17 minutes the little Belgian ran into the Albion box, turning Ahmed Hegazi neatly.

Alexandra Burke opens up as she returns to the spotlight.Alexandra Burke arrives at her Fabulous photo shoot with the sort of boundless energy more commonly associated with a Labrador pup.19 Alexandra Burke opens up as she returns to the spotlight on Strictly Come DancingCoat off and bag down, she’s immediately on her iPhone ordering a batch of Dum Dum doughnuts for the team (“because life’s too short not to have a bit of what you like”). Then she brews a cup of tea, which she sips as we discuss the root of her afternoon giddiness – yesterday was date night with her boyfriend Josh Ginnelly, as the couple celebrated two and a half years together.“We had a Chinese and then went to the cinema and I had a glass of wine,” says Alexandra. She starts laughing. “We watched Thor: Ragnarok and there’s a bit where Chris Hemsworth’s top’s off and Josh said to me: ‘Close your mouth.’ It was a fun night! We needed it.”As one of this year’s Strictly Come Dancing front runners, Alexandra, 29, is devoting every waking hour to the BBC show, packing in four 10-hour training sessions a week with her professional dance partner Gorka Marquez before a “killer” all-day rehearsal ahead of Saturday’s live show.Inevitably, Alexandra’s work commitments leave little time for anything else, including stage manager Josh, 30.19 Alexandra says she is devoting every minute to Strictly which includes four 10-hour training sessions a week19 Alexandra admits she feels guilty about being so busy all the time but says Strictly is 'a dream come true'“On Saturday morning I texted Josh from the Strictly make-up seat, saying: ‘If I get through to next week, this is the schedule they’ve sent me,’ and he replied: ‘Oh, literally no time for us,’” says Alexandra, adding that she often feels “guilty” about being so busy.“As much as Josh and my family get what I’m doing, being on Strictly means that I never get to really see them and I miss them. That’s why last night was so important for Josh and me to have a couple of hours to ourselves.”In truth, Alexandra wouldn’t have it any other way. Strictly is, in her words, a “dream come true”. Along with former JLS singer Aston Merrygold, she is the first celebrity to be recruited from The X Factor, which she won in 2008.Yet the day the Strictly launch was filmed on August 28, she came close to quitting after her mother, former Soul II Soul singer Melissa Bell, died aged 53 following a nine-year battle with kidney failure.19 Alexandra is the first celebrity to be recruited from The X Factor along with Aston Merrygold19 Alexandra's partner on Strictly is Gorka Marquez“I remember sitting outside the hospital and texting my manager to say: ‘I don’t know if I should do this.’ I spoke to the producers and said: ‘I’m not sure I should be here,’” recalls Alexandra, who says she was eventually persuaded to continue by her aunt Sonia.Of course, anyone who has experienced the death of a loved one knows there’s no right or wrong way to get through your grief. But that didn’t stop the trolls from attacking Alexandra for appearing on Strictly following Melissa’s death.“People have asked: ‘How can she do this?’ and said I’m obviously not upset about my mum because I’ve gone straight on TV. That’s really upsetting to read. They have no idea how much this show meant to my mum and how much it meant to me to be asked to be part of it.""Thank you for your concern but you know nothing about me, what my mum went through or what my family are currently going through.”Alexandra Burke and Gorka Marquez dance the Cha Cha Cha on Strictly Come Dancing Alexandra’s eyes glaze as she holds back her tears.“My heart is breaking, I’ve lost my mum, and believe me, if I could put everything in a box and throw it in the ocean and never feel this way again, I would. But, right now, I’m dealing with it the best way I can. I’m not taking it day by day, I’m taking it second by second.”Alexandra visits her mum’s grave every Sunday and says her Strictly family are a massive support, particularly This Morning presenter Ruth Langsford, who has a “maternal” presence.19 Alexandra lost her mum to a nine-year battle with kidney failure on August 282017 GC Images19 Alexandra Burke met her boyfriend Josh Ginnelly on the set of The BodyguardIn turn, Alexandra’s participation is providing her family, especially her siblings Sheneice, 31, David, 30, and Aaron, 24, with a much-needed focus.When she was a child, Alexandra was inspired to become a singer after seeing her mother on Top of The Pops.By the age of nine, thanks to her mum’s expert vocal training, she was performing in pubs and clubs and at bar mitzvahs, weddings and funerals.Melissa was a strict teacher, raising her four children single-handedly after her marriage to Alexandra’s dad David fell apart when Alexandra was six years old. On one occasion, Alexandra had to learn an entire Whitney Houston album before being allowed to play outside the family home in Holloway, north London – a task she ultimately failed.Getty - Contributor19 Alexandra during the curtain call of The Bodyguard at the Adelphi TheatreBBC19 The 2008 X Factor winner says she almost quit the show when she found out her mum died the day they filmed the Strictly launchThough she credits her mum’s discipline for her career success, by the time Alexandra was 16 and gigging as a solo artist, their relationship had collapsed completely.“It was a massive fireball that went off,” says Alexandra, who left home and didn’t speak to her family for two years. “While I was growing up, my mum and I became so similar that we clashed.I wanted my independence, but she said I had grown up too quickly. Any relationship like mine and my mum’s was going to be strained.”Alexandra returned home at 18 after splitting up with a “bad influence” boyfriend. Not long after, Melissa was diagnosed with stage five kidney failure brought on by diabetes, which “absolutely” put things into perspective.BBC Pictures' Digital Picture19 Trolls have criticised Alexandra for still doing the show even though her mum had just diedBBC19 Alexandra visits her mum's grave every Sunday and says Ruth Langsford has been very supportive“And then we became the best of friends,” she says.A grafter in her personal life and her career, Alexandra clearly loves to work, but after huge post-X-Factor success – her first two singles, Hallelujah and Bad Boys, and her debut album Overcome were all No.1s – she experienced some setbacks.Second album Heartbreak on Hold only reached number 18, and in June 2013 her record label RCA terminated her deal. That prompted Alexandra to venture into theatre, first with The Bodyguard and later Sister Act.Has she ever doubted her future in music, especially when RCA left her high and dry?Alexandra Burke bursts into tears for her late mum after receiving the first 10s of the series on Strictly Come Dancing“No. Never. It just wasn’t right for me to be at a certain label at that time. I won’t quit anything I love to do. I’ll just find another route,” she explains, before admitting it hasn’t always been plain sailing.“It has been hard not doing what I love in the sense of recording, because that’s my main priority. I loved theatre, but I want to do more albums, perform on the Brits, do Radio 1 Live Lounge, perform at festivals.”Alexandra has pushed herself to focus on the positives after spending too long at the start of her career obsessing over criticism of her character, appearance and the fact she was regularly emotional on The X Factor.While working in New York in 2014, she completed a life-coaching course, which affected her so deeply she had the words “love and loyalty” tattooed on her chest and “honour, love and trust” inked inside three fingers on her left hand. She says she lives by these values daily.BBC Pictures' Digital Picture19 Alexandra admits that her and her mum clashed when she was a teenagerGetty - Contributor19 Alexandra ventured in theatre after her label RCA dropped her“The most important thing I learned was positivity can always overrule negativity and that vulnerability isn’t a weakness but a strength,” she says. “I showed I was vulnerable on The X Factor because I cried a fair bit, and then I stopped. I went quite cold, but doing the life coaching meant I opened my heart again.”She certainly wears her heart on her sleeve today, especially when talking about the “love of her life” Josh, who she met on the set of The Bodyguard and lives with in Hertfordshire with their four dogs (her “babies”).“He’s amazing, and one day, when the time is right, hopefully those things will fall into place – marriage and kids. I yearn to have a family, I yearn for us to have a family,” she smiles.Alexandra has dated famous men in the past, including Entourage star Jeremy Piven, who she alludes to when she describes the difficulty of long-distance dating. How is Josh different from her exes?PA19 Alexandra addresses rumours ranging from being 'furious' with her partner to being a 'home wrecker'19 Alexandra says she is not mad at her partner Gorka and has nothing against Gemma, who he is supposedly dating“Josh cares and he’s a family guy,” she says. “When you meet a man who respects his parents, in particular his mother, it means he’s a good man.”During her three and a half years in theatre, Alexandra flew below the radar. But Strictly has changed all that, and since this series started, the rumours have been swirling.According to one story, Alexandra is “furious” with Gorka over his reported romance with her rival celeb Gemma Atkinson and worried the distraction will ruin her chances of winning.“I’ve seen the reports saying that I’m at war with Gorka, and it’s news to me,” says Alex. “We are as committed as each other to making it as far as possible in the competition, and of course we have days where we might be stressed or over-tired, but that’s to be expected when you’re training 10 hours a day! Gorka has become a dear friend who I respect and value highly.""19 Alexandra insists that her partner Gorka has become a dear friend19 Another rumour Alexandra addresses is that she is a 'home wrecker' for dating a married manIn another article, Alexandra was labelled a “home wrecker” for entering a relationship with a married dad nearly a decade ago.“We split up nine years ago and the reality of that situation is not what was portrayed,” Alexandra clarifies. “He was separated so he shouldn’t have to be made to look like that, but unfortunately it’s the way it works.”But what of her friendship with judge Craig Revel Horwood? It’s true that he directed and choreographed Sister Act, sparking complaints from viewers that Alexandra has an advantage over the other contestants.“There was no Latin or ballroom in Sister Act,” she explains. “It was wacky, very ‘Craig’, fabulous choreography but nothing technical. Craig has no influence over who gets picked for the show.”BBC Handout19 After Strictly, Alexandra hopes to keep dancing and continuing lessonsNow Alexandra wants to stick it up to those who believe she is professionally trained.“I’m going to work so hard it looks like I could be,” she says. “But I’ve never danced this kind of dance in my life.

He was in the full blown state of video dream psychosis.“Essentially he was in the matrix – he didn’t know what was real and what wasn’t. He had to be psychiatrically hospitalised for a month to tether himself to reality.”©UKTV5 Dr Kardaras will be appearing on tonight’s edition of The Davina Hour, with Davina McCallDr Kardaras coined the term “digital heroin” last year after “very clearly seeing the parallels between screen addiction” and substance abuse.Writing in New York Post, he said “iPads, smartphones and Xboxes are a form of digital drug” that transform kids into ""psychotic junkies"". He claims screens “increase depression, anxiety and aggression”.He told The Sun Online: “I’m not attempting to trivialise heroin addiction, and I’m certainly not saying it’s as fatal.“But we are clearly seeing, clinical and neurologically, screens impacting the brain the same way as substance addiction.”©UKTV5 Davina McCall hosts a panel on screen addiction on tonights The Davina HourDr Kardaras claims screens affect the frontal cortex of the brain (the bit that controls impulsivity and allows us to make choices) just like class A drugs.“Studies have shown with cocaine and heroin addiction, grey matter effectively shrinks, which leads to a compromised frontal cortex. This is exactly the same as young people on screens,” he said.He also claims that “video games can be as dopamine activating as a sexual experience”.“I call it a brain orgasm for seven year olds,” he said. “They’re not neurologically equipped to have something so dopamine activating.“You’re giving something dopamine activating to young children who don’t have the impulse control, they don’t have fully developed brains and frontal cortex’s yet.Dr. Nicholas Kardaras5 Dr Kardaras says he realised the dark side of screen culture a decade ago“They don’t have the neurological apparatus to control something like that.”Dr Kardaras “is not anti-technology” but believes children “aren’t neurologically developed enough to handle something as powerful as a screen experience”.He added: “I think children under 10 shouldn’t have individual screen devices – they’re own smart phones and iPads. Some desktop computer exposure is okay but definitely no portal devices before the age of 10.”Dr Kardaras believes adults have been “lulled” into thinking screens are okay for their children, and that it’s okay to use them as “digital babysitters”.“Parents have bought the false narrative that screens are educational,” he said.How is tech addiction treated?The Nightingale Hospital in London is the first to launch a Technology Addiction Service, which aims to help people socialise more away from screensTreatment is based on the individual, but will often include interpersonal therapy, tech hygiene and a look at life skills and healthInterpersonal therapy focuses on how tech is impacting the way the person communicated and interacts with othersTech hygiene look at a person's realtionship with tech. It will often include things like relaxation, sleep therapy and CBLife skills and health & helps the person deal with the demands of daily life, as well as things like increasingly physical activity and nutrition“I spent 10 years researching this and there’s not one study that shows a child with a tablet has better educational outcomes than a low technology child. Kids with less technology tend to do better academically.”Dr Kardaras says there are a number of warning signs to look out for if you fear your child is addicted to their screen.“The symptoms are very similar to if you’re addicted to substances,” he said.“A person engages in a substance and forms behaviour so compulsively despite adverse impacts in their life.”He says tech addiction can negatively impact their school studies, relationships with friends or family, as well as other hobbies such as sport or music.He also warns children can throw “explosive” tantrums if the device is taken away, and the child can become “very moody and aggressive” when screen time is been controlled.Getty - Contributor5 Parents need to become more tech cautious and ensure they are not passing their habits on to their children Picture posed by models)Unfortunately, there is not healthy time limit on which children should use devices per day.“There is no absolute rule, every child is different,” he said. “Some children are more vulnerable to screen effects than others. There is no absolute guideline.“Some children are able to tolerate fairly long periods of screen time, while others are not. You need to know your own child, how much the screen arouses them.”Dr Kardaras appears on The Davina Hour to discuss screen addiction, and how we should all be more tech cautious.“We need to be more tech cautious with our children and ourselves,” he said.“If adults have problems moderating our use of it, how do we expect a seven year old to have the impulsive control over something parent struggle with?”Last month, we revealed how a seven-year-old boy developed a tech addiction after playing violent video games for six hours a day.Meanwhile, inside the secretive world of Chinese internet addiction camps where teens are beaten, tied up and plied with drugs to ‘cure’ their obsession with computer games.The Davina Hour concludes tonight at 9pm on W.

The Indian Ocean waters to the south of Sri Lanka attract large numbers of blue whales.I take a taxi down the coast from Galle to the tiny port of Mirissa, where whale- watchers head out to sea on guided tours every morning hoping to spot these giants.It is not long before our guide is pointing into the distance at what at first seems like just a few spurts of water.As our boat edges closer, it becomes clear the water is being sprayed from a whale’s blowhole — and we witness a moment even dedicated whale-watchers can spend years waiting for.I hold my breath as a huge tail flicks into the air.Alamy8 There's plenty of tea plantations and wildlife to see and explore in Sri LankaIt is completely upright and out of the water for what is only a few seconds but feels like minutes, before the whale dives back down out of sight and I finally breathe out.After a couple of days’ sightseeing, and the excitement of seeing blue whales in the wild, I am ready to lay back, relax and soak up the sun. And what better spot to do this at than the Amari Galle Hotel? Every room has a sea view and I look out from my balcony on to its own private beach and two pools.My only concern is deciding where to go to enjoy being treated like a VIP.Each sun lounger comes with a call button for bar service, so there is never any worry about where my next drink is coming from.8 Our writer enjoys an afternoon at the spa at Amari Galle Hotel8 Check out the swimming pools at Amari Galle HotelAt the hotel’s Breeze Spa I am asked to choose how I want to feel at the end of my pampering massage. I select Rejuvenated — before letting the masseuse work her magic.Tempting as it is to stay and relax at the resort, it would be a crime to come all this way — just over ten hours from London — and not explore some of the local highlights.A 10km taxi ride from the hotel is the Japanese Peace Pagoda. This gleaming-white Buddhist temple is one of 80 similar monuments built around the world to promote, as the name suggests, peace.Nearby is Unawatuna Beach, a charming crescent of golden sand fringed by palm trees, which is popular with tourists and locals alike.It can get busy but the sea is warm and inviting. This year is the 150th anniversary of Ceylon tea being grown in Sri Lanka and the plantations that cover vast swathes of the country’s highlands have a reputation for producing some of the highest-quality tea in the world.Black Ceylon tea — the kind blended to make English breakfast — is the default here, served with milk, and I am never far from someone offering a cuppa.Go: Sri LankaGETTING/STAYING THERE: Hayes & Jarvis have five nights’ B&B at the 4* Amari Galle from £899 per person, including flights from Heathrow with Sri Lankan Airlines.See hayesandjarvis.co.uk or call 01293 762 456.MORE INFO: See amari.com/galle-srilanka and srilanka.travel.But a love of tea is not the only thing us Brits share with Sri Lanka — rice and curry is the national dish.The Amari Galle’s restaurant offers a selection of local specialities — flavoured with the country’s famous cinnamon and using fish and seafood caught a stone’s throw from the kitchen.A few days is not enough time to taste even a fraction of the dishes on offer but I am also keen to try out the rooftop cocktail bar, where I catch a stunning sunset on my last evening.Their fantastic menu of reworked classics, and sharing drinks and food with friends, is the ideal accompaniment to another picture-perfect view.It is enough to make me wish I could stay in Sri Lanka long after the sun has set for the final time on my trip.MOST READ IN TRAVELTHOMAS SHOOK What are my rights if Thomas Cook goes bust after I've booked my holiday?

152,Theresa May’s party conference speech dubbed the worst ever after a series of disasters as she tried to win back angry voters,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4613960/theresa-mays-worst-speech-ever/,"4th October 2017, 8:32 pm","THERESA May suffered a Tory conference nightmare yesterday as her speech was branded the worst ever.The PM’s keynote address turned into a shambles as she was pranked, part of the set collapsed behind her and she suffered a coughing fit. One historian said: “It’s hard to think of a more diabolically disastrous speech.”PA:Press Association15 One big shamble was a prank where TV Prankster Simon handed Mrs May a P45 form 'from Boris' while she was on stage speakingThe PM’s address to close the Tories’ annual gathering was billed as her bid to win back angry voters.But as loyal lieutenants rallied round her with sympathy, enemy Tory MPs launched a fresh bout of plotting to oust her.The Sun can reveal that several Cabinet ministers judged Mrs May’s personal horror so serious that they rang No10 to insist she must not resign.During the 66-minute long shambles:15 Amber Rudd had to tell Boris Johnson to stand up and clap after the speechReuters15 By the end of the speech so many letters had fallen off the back dropGetty - Contributor15 Mrs May lost her voice and had many coughing fits during 66-minute speech Mrs May fall victim to TV prankster Simon Brodkin, who handed her a P45 form “from Boris’ on the stage,She repeatedly struggled to get her words out as a cold and dry cough robbed her of her voice,Several letters fell from a back drop slogan behind her as she spoke, revealing a Fawlty Towers-style crumbling set,Accusations flew that her speech writers had stolen a key line for the speech from the West Wing US TV series.refer to caption.15 One of the shambles were the letters falling off the backdrop behind her as she spokeGetty Images - Getty15 The Prime Minister battled a cold and struggled to get her words out during the speechLoyal ministers resorted to repeatedly leaping to their feet to give the PM a series of standing ovations during her coughing fits in the hope of giving her precious seconds to recover her voice.During one, Home Secretary Amber Rudd was caught on camera ordering still sedentary Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to his feet to join in.Chancellor Philip Hammond even handed the PM a cough sweet at the podium, allowing her to recover enough to get to the end.As the PM finally finished the speech to activists’ relieved cheers, husband Philip May leaped onto the stage to give her a bear hug, and overheard telling her: ""I'm proud of you"".News Group Newspapers Ltd15 The letters falling off the backdrop were compared to something that came out of TV show Fawlty TowersThe humiliated Tory leader tried to make light of the disaster by later tweeting a snap of her cough mixtures and throat lozenges, with the single word “*coughs*”.But one stunned minister told The Sun his reaction to her speech was: ""What the f--king f--k f--k f--k. F--k.""Aides blamed her loss of voice on themselves, for having put them PM through 28 different TV interviews and 19 receptions during the previous four days.Senior Tories demanded answers from the police and conference organisers on how the multiple shambles could have been allowed to happen.PA:Press Association15 Aides blamed Theresa May's loss of voice on themselves as she did 28 interviews and 19 receptions over the past four daysThere were also calls for the party’s chairman Patrick McLoughlin to resign.Political historians were also united in their grim verdict.Professor Philip Cowley of Queen Mary University of London told The Sun: ""It's difficult to think of a more disastrous conference speech in modern political history"".Historian Guy Walters added: ""It's hard to think of a more diabolically disastrous and cringe worthy conference speech in modern political history.AFP or licensors15 The PM's husband, Philip May, leapt up to hug her after her speech“It's cute to tweet Strepsils, but the Tory party needs stronger medicine and indeed, a doctor who can work miracles.""The pitiful scenes overshadowed a series of big new policies.Mrs May had unveiled a plan to build “a new generation” of council homes, enforce her long-promised energy cap, and pledged an opt-out system for organ donation as well as a major review of the heavily criticised 30 year-old Mental Health Act.In a bid to reconnect with frustrated voters who have flocked to hard left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the PM also defined the mission for the rest of her Premiership as "" to renew the British dream of progress between generations"".Reuters15 Mrs May unveiled plans to to build 'a new generation' of council homes and ordered a review of the Mental Health ActMrs May also gave the party faithful her most direct and fulsome apology yet for botching June’s general election.Admitting that the campaign was ""too scripted and too presidential"", the PM grovelled: ""I hold my hands up for that. I take responsibility. I am sorry"".In a bid to overcome her 'Maybot' robotic image, Mrs May also delved deeper than ever before into her personal background and motivation to hold the nation’s top job.She revealed her grandmother had worked as a domestic servant, and that it had been “a great sadness for me and Philip that we were never blessed with children”.AFP or licensors15 The botched delivery ended the four-day gathering that was already filled with bitter spats with Boris JohnsonCabinet ministers rallied to Mrs May’s side.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who appeared to have tears of sympathy in his eyes for her at one stage of the speech, said of her coughing fits: “I’m sure it made her come across as very human”.Scots Tory leader Ruth Davidson insisted: “If ever the PM needed a metaphor for service and duty through adversity, that battling performance was it. Huge respect.”Philip Hammond said “she showed resilience.""EPA15 Boris Johnson tweeted afterwards commending Mrs May for putting housing at the centre of 'renewing the British dream'And Boris Johnson tweeted: ""Great job by the PM today putting housing at the heart of renewing the British dream"".But her critics leaped on the disaster.One Tory MP said the speech meant “a leadership election must come and it must come soon.”Another backbencher added: ""As Napoleon always asked of those promoted to General: 'Are they lucky?'Rex Features15 Amber Rudd had also admitted the Tory Party was shell-shocked at the start of the conferenceI'm not sure Theresa May is lucky. An opportunity lost and there aren't many left"".Another minister claimed that Tory MPs were not ready to pounce on her, putting down the alleged plots to just “a good dose of Chinese whispers”.Foreign Affairs committee chair and senior backbencher Tom Tugendhat added: “Funnily enough the party will love her for this.“She showed dignity and courage.”EPA15 Theresa May was accused of giving the worst party conference speech ever after many staggering disastersThe botched speech delivery ended the four day gathering that had already been marred by bitter spats between Cabinet ministers, and Boris Johnson’s challenge to the PM’s authority on Brexit by spelling out four new red lines for her.Amber Rudd admitted the Tory Party was shell-shocked at the start of conference.Speaking ahead of the PM’s speech, the rising star conceded the atmosphere was “flat” before insisting the party had since rediscovered its “mojo”.Lib Dem leader Vince Cable said after the speech: “This was the speech of a brave Prime Minister struggling on, while her disloyal Cabinet colleagues openly plot against her”.But Labour leaped on it as a metaphor for her crumbling premiership.Referring to the letter ‘F’ that fell from the slogan behind Mrs May, Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon taunted: “It's an F off to the country from Conservative Party Conference”.For more on this story15Listen to Julila Hartley-Brewer today from 10am on DAB, via the talkRADIO app or online at talkradio.co.uk  MOST READ IN POLITICS ExclusiveSAJ'S MIGRATION BID Sajid Javid to scrap £30,000 minimum salary threshold for EU migrants ACID THREAT Nigel Farage should have had ACID thrown on him, Labour supporter says LatestSHAKEDOWN 'Radicalised Remainer' who threw £5.25 milkshake at Farage charged with assault 'TOO LATE' Ofcom slammed for waiting until THIRD death before launching reality show probe BORIS BOMBSHELL Boris Johnson is biggest threat to Jeremy Corbyn, Labour voters fear RevealedMILK MANIAC Nigel Farage milkshake attacker is a fanatical Remainer and Corbyn fan "

154,"FIFA 18 highest rated players, hints, tips, Ultimate Team and Career Mode information",https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/3760861/highest-rated-players-career-mode/,"29th September 2017, 5:14 pm","FIFA 18 is on sale NOW!But before you buy it, we've gottogether every bit of information about EA SPORTS' brilliant new game.This includes a detailed review, the cheapest places to purchase it, the highest rated players, hints, tips and much, much more.But first - do you know anyone called Alex Hunter? Well you better give them a call.That's because GAME is offering anyone who shares the name of the main character, Alex Hunter, a free copy of the game.IS YOUR FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM ALREADY IN PIECES? DREAM TEAM WEEKENDER IS JUST THE CUREAlex Hunters of the UK simply need to send their full name, address and a scan or photo of their I.D.* to content@game.co.uk.They will then be directed to their nearest GAME store to collect their copy.34 You can customise Alex Hunter in The Journey this yearThis offer forms part of an action-packed week of FIFA 18 launch events at GAME, which kicked off on Monday night with midnight openings in 248 stores for the early access Ronaldo Edition.Fans can also head down this evening as 250 GAME stores will again be opening just before midnight ahead of the standard edition’s official launch on tomorrow.This full list of stores can be found hereNow, is FIFA 18 any good?Verdict FIFA 18 is a far superior game than FIFA 17 - but there are still some issues.Frostbite, for all its good looks, still brings with it numerous annoying glitches and errors. We hope EA patches these in the coming weeks.However, when it comes to gameplay, the shift towards a more tactical experience is welcome - encouraging you to really think about the game, and rewarding you amply when you do.34 Improved lighting effects allow for more realistic stadiumsPES 2018, on the other hand, is vastly different - offering a faster, arguably more fun, football experience.Wait, what about the Nintendo Switch version?The Nintendo Switch version will not use Frostbite, claiming it's to avoid a 'sh***y second-rate game'.Frostbite, the in-house engine developed by EA DICE, powers FIFA 18 on Xbox One, PS4 and PC.However, FIFA on the Switch will use a 'custom engine' based on the Ignite code from FIFA 16.While EA confirmed the Switch can handle Frostbite, the company opted to build a unique engine because it would have to be heavily downgraded, resulting in a 'sh***y second rate game'. FIFA 18 on the Nintendo Switch is shaping up to be the best handheld version to dateAndrei Lazarescu, who leads the team in Bucharest working on FIFA for Nintendo Switch, told Dream Team Gaming: ""As much as we would have wanted to (use Frostbite) you can't without making the whole engine work.""We intentionally chose to do a custom engine because we felt that rather and try and get Frostbite running and end up having to downsize things and making it just a smaller, lower-quality version of the PS4 and Xbox One versions, we wanted this to be a FIFA that stands on its own two feet.""We want people to recognise it and play it for what it is rather than saying, hey, you're getting a sh***y, second-rate game. This is a full FIFA that players players will enjoy.""For those worried about the lack of Frostbite, Lazarescu is confident the Switch version looks far superior than the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions.LIKE FANTASY FOOTBALL? SIGN UP TO PLAY DREAM TEAM WEEKENDER NOW""If you put the two together you won't recognise them,"" he said.""When you dock it (and connect to the TV), it's 1080p and 60 frames per second - Gen 3 (PS3 / Xbox 360) never run on this.""We're also using physics based rendering, another thing that Gen 3 did not have. We're even putting ICONS in Ultimate Team - Gen 3 won't have these either.""FIFA 18 on the Nintendo Switch will feature Career Mode - but it won't be anything like the version on Xbox One, PS4 and PC.While the Xbox One, PS4 and PC versions will include new features and presentation - inducing interactive transfer negotiations - the Switch version will be a carbon copy of FIFA 17's version.Lazarescu said: ""(Career Mode) is probably a similar experience to last year - but it is an experience that has been catered for this season.""When asked if there's anything the Switch does differently in the mode, he said: ""In Career Mode, no.""While this may disappoint some players, it could prove very handy for those already familiar with the game.What else is worth knowing about the Switch version? The Switch has already proven itself as a brilliant handheld companion, so being able to play the full game (not just the Web App) on the go will give this version the edge.Thankfully, FIFA has been 'custom built' for Nintendo's new hardware.It may not use the latest Frostbite technology but gameplay is sleek, responsive and runs at 60FPS.34 You can play mates by detaching the Joy Con controllersPlus, you're able to detach the Joy Con controllers and play a friend - although this can be a bit fiddly.A battery life of up to six hours makes it perfect for long journeys.It has Ultimate TeamAs long as you have Wifi you'll be able to play Ultimate Team and buy packs as you normally would.Champions won't feature but that's not the end of the world.Graphics and presentation The Switch version odes not use Frostbite but will still looks great.In fact, it runs at 1080p 60FPS when plugged into a TV, and 720p 60 when in handheld mode.EA producer Andrei Lazaresco told Eurogamer about how they made the most out of Switch's Nvidia Maxwell-based Tegra X1 chip.34 The Switch version will not feature The Journey: Hunter's Return - which will anger some Nintendo fans""We're using physical-based rendering,"" he said. ""The crowds are 3D. The grass is 3D. The lighting is new.""And on top of that you'll have Ultimate Team for the first time on Nintendo - and for the first time you'll be able to take it on the go. You'll be able to play on a plane, on a bus, even from just a hotspot.""How good is Cristiano Ronaldo?The Portuguese is one of the game's best players and boats a 94 rating.EA Sports took an age to motion capture every aspect of the star - from his running style to his trademark 'Siiiiii' celebration.The latter sees the 32-year-old sprint over to the corner, leap into the air then plant his feet into the ground and shout 'Siiii' (which means yes in Portuguese).34 EA has missed the mark slightly when it comes to Ronaldo's trademark celebrationHowever, it's not quite getting the reaction EA or the Portuguese would like.It's largely because, as Eurogamer's Wesley Yin Poole states, they've made Ronaldo sound like a 'wild boar'.DREAM TEAM EXCLUSIVE OFFER: BET £5, GET A FREE £20 BETHe writes: ""The in-game ""Siiiiii!"" sounds wrong to me, and it's completely jarring. I see what EA was shooting for here, but the developers have missed the mark. It's hilariously bad.""FIFA fans have already compared Ronaldo's in-game ""Siiiiii!"" to the noise a wild boar makes.""It's not a great comparison, but like Ronaldo and a football, I'll run with it.""34 EA may have to do something about the move before fans really kick offIt's not known yet whether EA Sports plans to do anything about the celebration, but surely an audio tweak should be on the cards.OK, apart from this FIFA 18 sounds great ... where's the cheapest place to pick it up?As supply will outweigh demand, loads of top retailers will be vying for your business, meaning a lot of the best FIFA 18 deals can be had closer to launch on September 29.We've pulled together the best FIFA 18 deals here - and we'll keep updating should we spot any more.Right now, you can expect to fork out £49.99 for the game in most stores.

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?The Switch version does not use Frostbite technology or include The Journey.However, having played it, FIFA on the Switch performs very well and should be a hit.34 FIFA 17 looked the part, but the Frostbite Engine is capable of so much moreSo, how much better does FIFA 18 look? Speaking to Dream Team Gaming, Frostbite Studio Director Jonas Skantz revealed: “I can assure you that Frostbite continues to be a true differentiator.""That's certainly the case - FIFA 18 looks very, very good indeed.Yes, it’s still prone to weird glitches and bugs, but on the whole, it’s tremendously impressive.Improved lighting and player models are the most noticeable improvements.Star players such as Cristiano Ronaldo look almost lifelike in the replays, while an improved animation systems allows for more realistic movement across the board.Stadiums are teeming with intricate details, too – whether it’s cameramen snapping away near the stands, or stewards containing the bustling crowds.Speaking of which, crowds have had a huge boost this year – with more sophisticated models and animations.34 Stadiums have been completely re-worked this year to allow for more realismThe result is that you can now celebrate with them – watching as they scramble down the stands to try and reach you.EA has subtly changed how the stadiums are lit – so if you’re playing in South America, a hazy, sun-kissed look helps it feel very different to if you’re playing in Manchester.Managers have been given a much-needed spit and polish, too – now looking almost as good as the players themselves. They’re still not quite there, but it’s a huge improvement.When compared with PES 2018, EA’s game holds up well. There’s more sheen and gloss in FIFA 18, but PES offers cleaner, more crisp visuals.There’s no ‘one is better than the other’ this year, it just comes down to preference.Tell us about the Xbox 360 and Ps3 versions - surely they'll be better than last year?Sadly, not. It won't feature The Journey or use the Frostbite engine.“Yes, it will be coming out on Xbox 360 and PS3 but is going to be a ‘Gold’ version”, EA SPORTS’ lead gameplay producer Sam Rivera told Dream Team Gaming.“So there will be updates in the rosters but nothing big, new – like the new engine. It’s just basically an update.”Rivera confirmed the game will run on Ignite – which has been used since FIFA 16.This means it will be almost identical to last year’s game and look noticeably worse than FIFA 18 on the Xbox One, PS4 and PC.Bringing The Journey to last-gen consoles would require recreating the entire experience using Ignite – a move that makes no sense from either a technical or commercial perspective.Still, that didn’t stop fans from expressing their anger at Alex Hunter’s omission on older consoles in FIFA 17.34 FIFA 18's The Journey will see Alex Hunter travel around the world however it will not feature in PS3, Switch or Xbox 360 versions of the gameLast year, some didn’t realise until it was too late – and bought FIFA 17 on Xbox 360 and PS3 only to be disappointed that the key mode didn’t feature.Retailers were equally as confused, with Amazon.co.uk coming under fire for accidentally using screenshots from the current-gen version of the game on adverts for the Xbox 360 version.One wrote: “My son bought this as it clearly said it included journey mode unlike the standard version costed over 50 pounds. He is now bitterly disappointed having wasted his money this game is no better than fifa 15.”Another said: “This was purchased for my 12 year old out of his birthday money.“He was so excited when it arrived and looking forward to playing it, however this soon turned to bitter disappointment when he discovered that it did not include The Journey and therefore not much different from previous versions of FIFA.”Despite the lack of Frostbite and The Journey, FIFA 18 is currently being listed at £49.99 – the same price as the current-gen version.34 A screenshot of the Amazon page using the wrong imagery for the last-gen version of FIFA 17 There have been lots of changes in Career Mode - but is there anything significant missing?As we've mentioned, FIFA 18 will feature interactive transfer negotiations in Career Mode - but they'll be missing something. Audible dialogue.According to YouTuber ChesnoidGaming, dialogue will just appear as text at the bottom of the screen, and will not be spoken by the characters.The decision to not include any audible dialogue may come as a shock to some fans - especially given the mode now closely mirrors the dialogue set up in The Journey.In that mode, players hear what Alex Hunter is saying and, as in Career Mode, can steer conversations with multiple dialogue choices.34 Transfer negotiations are one of the most exciting parts about FIFA 18's Career ModeAlthough it would be near impossible to get every player in the game to deliver lines during negotiations, recruiting actors to play random agents certainly wouldn't be too far fetched.What about Legends - are they making a return?FIFA 18 has ditched Xbox exclusive Legends in favour of multi-platform Icons.You can find out more information about FIFA 18 Icons hereSo, will there just be one ICON card per player?Nope. FIFA 18 fans will be able to play with three versions of their favourite players.FUT ICONS Stories was revealed at FUT live - and will see legends such as Pele, Ronaldo Nazario, Thierry Henry, Lev Yashin and Diego Maradona have three different cards each - all available in FIFA Ultimate Team.34 Pele's card makes the Brazilian the highest rated player on the gameThe cards each reflect each different stage of a player's career - the beginning, their prime and tail-end.All cards have different stats and appearances.The best card is a 98-rated Pele - reflecting the Brazilian's ability in the 1970s.Will the game play the same as FIFA 17?FIFA 17 has come under fire for some aspects of its gameplay – but as FIFA 18 will be powered by the same engine, we doubt much will change here.Input delay – the time it takes for a button press to translate into an on-screen action – has led to some negative feedback in FIFA 17.There have also been claims of 'EAaids' or 'scripting', which refers to the game dynamically adjusting online matches to favour weaker players.34 Animation was sometimes clunky and unnatural in FIFA 17 - but we're confident EA will smooth things out in FIFA 18Whilst the former issue is a result of the game’s severs compensating for 'Ping' or connection strength variance between online players, we’d expect to see action taken over 'EAAids'.Sounds good. Since people have got their hands on FIFA 18 what's been the general consensus? Thankfully, the general feedback from the demo and beta has been positive - but there’s one thing that’s causing fans a big headache.Pace.In fact, it’s causing such a stir, that some fans have kicked off their own thread on Reddit discussing the matter.One wrote: “Pace is back, prepare yourselves. Defenders turn like trucks, forwards run like Bolt and turn like Judas.“Most frustrating is how hard it is to face your defenders up to someone running at you and often a striker will sprint right through your mid and defence to score.”Another said: “Pace is back…that is very sad. By the end of the year people will just stay back and counter attack. I hated FIFA 15 – they promised to make slow, high-rated defenders useful again.”It’s not a surprise that EA has tweaked this element of the gameplay in FIFA 18.The effectiveness of player pace has dwindled over the past few entries – especially in last year’s game.Too often some of the quickest players would be given a run for their money by players who, on paper, were far slower.By FIFA 18 adding more ‘meaning’ to the speed attribute, we should see matches become much faster – with greater emphasis on attacking down the flanks.What other things do fans want to see addressed in FIFA 18?There's quite a few things that annoyed gamers with FIFA 17.Here are the main ones.Long Shots - from 45 yards These find the back of the net far too often.It's largely because goalkeeper AI isn't up to scratch, meaning they spend too often standing still before attempting a dive.The shots themselves are way too accurate - so incorporating more human error would make things more realistic.Keepers Mechanics and goal line technology In penalties, the keepers sometimes do not save the ball despite the fact they dive in the correct direction.During open gameplay, they also get confused about when they should punch or catch a ball - the former often resulting in the ball landing to an opponent.The goal-line technology system is also incredibly erratic.34 Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after netting a goal in the FIFA 18 trailerPlayer animationsWhen a player is fouled, the 'complain' animation takes far too long - taking them out of the game for a noticeable period of time.This needs to be shortened.Defensive AIThe CPU AI is far too good at defending, so much so that it's often more effective to put the controller down and let it do the work.This needs to be toned down so it doesn't feel that you're trying to beat the computer as well as the human opponent.Scrapping auto blocking and auto tackles would be welcome too.34 Cristiano Ronaldo in action in the latest FIFA 18 trailerCorners, Headers and chestingSome fans have reported that corners leave you too exposed to a counter because players don't get back fast enough to cover.Regarding headers, it seems the attacker always has the ability to step in front of the defender, making it easier for them to score regardless of stats.Adding more control to the aerial tussle would improve things no end.Chesting the ball is also inconsistent and in desperate need of more control.ServersThese have been slightly flaky throughout FIFA 17's lifespan, so greater optimisation especially during peak times would be welcome.Thankfully, EA revealed that they have a dedicated team of people tasked with ensuring the servers are much improved come FIFA 18.Players should also be kicked for inactivity if they put down the controller for long periods of time.If a game disconnects during a match, there needs to be a period where it tries to reconnect to the player until a certain time limit is hit.34 Crowds have been completely re-worked in FIFA 18 - and now show off a much wider range of animationRefereesThese are often cited as being too inconsistent - with officials often awarding fouls for very weak challenges.Cards need to given out more frequently, especially for slide tackles.The red card bug, where the ref will send the last defender off if they tug on an attacker's shirt, needs to be axed, too.When they release a trailer?EA Sports have released the trailer for the new game here - you can watch it here.They also released a Journey 2: Hunter Returns trailerWhen will it come out, and will there be a demo?Yes. The FIFA 18 demo is out now. Will Cristiano Ronaldo still be the best player?In the demo, yes. In the full game Pele's ICON card trumps Ronaldo's by some distance.Expect his pace and dribbling to take a slight knock this year compared with his FIFA 17 stats.Speaking of which...Has Ronaldo's rating been revealed?Yes - he scores 94. He's slightly slower than in the last game but is more deadly in front of goal.Speaking of ratings... has there been any controversial decisions yet?You betcha.FIFA 18 fans are laying into EA Sports after Sadio Mane was listed lower in the top 100 players than Henrikh Mkhitaryan.Mane joined Liverpool last year but was instrumental in helping the side to a top four finish.Armenian Mkhitaryan had a decent season, too, helping United win a couple of trophies - but arguably, it was the Liverpool man who had the better season.34 The Armenian has a similar rating to Mane, but is ranked much higherHowever, Mane is rated in 98th place, while Mkhitaryan sits in 83rd. And some fans are not too happy about it.Loads took to Twitter to voice their concerns, with some threatening to not buy the game unless it was addressed.It was too late for one man kick offs to feature in FIFA 17 - but will they come along this year?The change in football laws came into effect at the start of the 2016/17 season, but too late for EA Sports to implement the change into FIFA 17.Fortunately, they have included the new rule into the game, meaning players will be using the one-man kick-off system in all matches.Dream Team was given the chance to play the new game, and experienced for ourselves the one-man kick-off format.Of course, we tried our best to kick it all the way back to the keeper, but we couldn’t do it in the build of the game we played (doubtless someone will come up with a YouTube video showing how to at a later date).34 Stadiums are much more detailed in FIFA 18But we were able to pass it back to the central defenders, wide midfielders, as well as just knock it back to the other forward.We also asked FIFA’s Lead Gameplay Producer Sam Rivera how frustrating it was that football changed the kick-off laws, just days after FIFA 17 had gone to press.He said: “I remember we talked about whether or not we could get it into the last game, but it was impossible for us to do it.“It’s a nice addition that you see in real life, how it works is basically we tried to find out which teams were doing one player kick offs and who weren’t, but we couldn’t find find any patterns.“So we just made it so that if you start the game with a one player kick off, you carry on the whole game with it whenever you take a kick-off.”Will the Chinese Super League feature?EA confirmed to Fox Sports that the league, arguably the fastest growing and richest in the world, will not feature in FIFA 18.EA SPORTS' lead gameplay producer Sam Rivera said: ""Our intention with FIFA is to bring the best leagues in the world.""Yes, we thought about the Chinese league, but for now the Super League will not be included in FIFA 18 .""Gamers have been calling on EA to include the Chinese Super League for months after a string of high-profile players made the move overseas.Earlier in the year, Jiangsu Suning’s Alex Teixeira Santos posted a picture on Instagram, with the caption: “Official presentation for FIFA 18 new jersey for the 2017 season.”Some took this to be a sign the league was set to be included - but it's clear now this is not the case.Will The Journey feature again? (SPOILER ALERT)Yes, it's called Hunter Returns.The Journey 2 will still follow the life and career of Alex Hunter, and no, you won’t be able to be anyone else.Unfortunately for those hoping to put themselves in the game, or play with a player of their choice, you still have to be Alex Hunter.Here's what we know:The story line decisions are much broaderLast season’s game mode saw the story line quite narrow, with limited decision making.It was the first time EA Sports had entered in a story mode like this, so we can forgive them, but this time round the story line is much, much broader, and the decisions you make will make a much greater difference.Whereas most of us ended up winning the FA Cup with our Hunters in FIFA 17, it’ll be interesting to see where our character can end up once we’ve taken different decisions from our mates.34 A screenshot from the FIFA 17's The JourneyThe gameplay and mechanics are virtually the sameWe haven’t had a chance to play the whole thing, far from it, but it looks as if though they’ve maintained the things we enjoyed most from The Journey.So decisions of fiery, cool or moderate stay, you’ll have to earn ratings in training and matches to excel, and scenes will happen sporadically through the story.You can modify your Alex Hunter to have blonde hair and tattoos…And the rest. You’ll be able to change the look of your Alex Hunter to have a vast array of different hairstyles, tattoos, tracksuits and so on.There is apparently ‘hundreds’ of options to choose from, which will be an exciting change.Read more about the changes you’ll be able to make to your character here.Dream Team34 How we think Alex Hunter could appear next seasonWill you be able to start where you left off in FIFA 17?That’s one thing we’ve not been told as yet, but it looks likely that you’ll have to start afresh with your new Hunter in this game.Presumably the thinking behind this (if it were the case) will be that because everyone ended their Hunter in a slightly different way but broadly on a similar path (winning the FA Cup, getting a 75 FUT card etc.), it would make more sense to just wipe the slate clean.Slightly annoying for those who became fond of their Hunter, but probably it’s all for the best.Does Alex Hunter get a girlfriend?Hmm, now this one could get interesting.At the FIFA 18 preview event in May, we watched a presentation on The Journey 2, in which an image of a woman, probably a similar age to Hunter, popped up.The guys from EA Sports pointed it out, said they won't tell us exactly who it was, before adding that there were 'a lot of new characters' that you come across and interact with.We can't say it definitively, but certainly one to watch.34 Marco Reus chats with Hunter in FIFA 17's The JourneyCristiano Ronaldo features in it, and quite heavilyCR7 is the real star of FIFA 18, given what we've seen of the game so far.It's no different in The Journey 2, and we've seen images and clips of Cristiano appearing in a scene alongside Hunter.Considering he's the cover star, the Real Madrid man will feature prominently in the game across the board.Speaking of which...Alex Hunter gets offered a move to Real Madrid?Whether or not this is as a result of a few decisions and good performances going right for your character, but we've witnessed a scene in which Hunter's agent storms into his kitchen/dining room/lounge (that hasn't changed) and offers him a move to Los Blancos.That's all we'll say about it here, you can read all about the scenes we've played here.You can play local multiplayer in your gameThis is a lovely little addition - you'll now be able to play The Journey alongside your friends.When you're met with the start game screen, you can play local multiplayer mode, meaning you can blame your friend sat next to you for not slipping in Hunter to secure a goal an a much-needed 7.0 rating.Oh, and Hunter now his own Twitter account.Yep, Hunter has joined Twitter... which is leading to some interesting results.The account, @MrAlexHunter, was started by EA as a means of ramping up PR ahead of the launch of FIFA 18 in September.It's a nice idea in theory, but in reality poor old Alex is getting torn to shreds.Largely because he's a fictional video game character and is little more than a bundle of pixels with no soul.Will free kicks and penalties stay the same?Penalties won't change much, but free kicks could see an overhaul.The new “momentum” system that governs the set-pieces is incredibly hard to master and has been panned by FIFA players.As a result, we’d expect this to revert back to the more “traditional” shot power and curl mechanic.34 Penalties can be hard to master - but can be prone to erratic goalkeeper AIThe system works wonders for penalties, though – allowing for much more control over shot placement and power.Goalkeeper AI during spot kicks is often found wanting, so expect EA to address this. Tell us about the stadiums - what ones will be included?Stadiums are one of the biggest talking points about FIFA 18.While FIFA 17 featured more than 70 stadiums – including the likes of the Santiago Bernabéu, Juventus Stadium and Allianz Arena, there were some notable names missing.Thankfully, as the guys at Goal pointed out, there are some new additions in FIFA 18.PA:Press Association34 Tottenham bid an emotional farewell to White Hart Lane against Manchester United earlier this yearThese include LA Galaxy's StubHub Center, newly-promoted Huddersfield Town's John Smith’s Stadium and Brighton & Hove Albion’s Amex arena.Getty Images34 An aerial image shows Tottenham's new stadium compared to White Hart LaneSadly, there's one notable omission - and we're not talking about the Camp Nou. White Hart Lane will not feature - as Tottenham have now moved to Wembley.The Estadio Vicente Calderon will also likely get the chop, given that Atletico Madrid are in the process of moving to the Wanda Metropolitano.Here's every stadium that will feature in the game - not including the generic ones.Premier LeagueDean Court: AFC BournemouthEmirates Stadium: ArsenalAmex Stadium: Brighton & Hove AlbionTurf Moor: BurnleyStamford Bridge: ChelseaSelhurst Park: Crystal PalaceGoodison Park: EvertonJohn Smith's Stadium: Huddersfield TownKing Power Stadium: Leicester CityAnfield: LiverpoolEtihad Stadium: Manchester CityOld Trafford: Manchester UnitedSt James' Park: Newcastle UnitedSt Mary's Stadium: Southamptonbet365 Stadium: Stoke CityLiberty Stadium: Swansea CityWembley: Tottenham HotspurVicarage Road: WatfordThe Hawthorns: West Bromwich AlbionLondon Stadium: West Ham UnitedPA:Press Association34 The Emirates Stadium will feature in FIFA 18EFL Championship Villa Park: Aston VillaKCOM Stadium: Hull CityRiverside: MiddlesbroughCarrow Road: Norwich CityLoftus Road: QPREFL League One Fratton Park: PortsmouthEuropeanAllianz Arena: Bayern MunichJohan Cruijff Arena: AjaxBorussia Park: Borussia MonchengladbachDonbass Arena: Shakhtar DonetskMestalla Stadium: Valencia CFJuventus Stadium: JuventusOlympiastadion: Hertha BerlinStade Velodrome: Olympique MarseilleParc des Princes: PSGSan Siro: AC Milan & Inter MilanSantiago Bernabeu: Real MadridSignal Iduna Park: Borussia DortmundVeltins Arena: Schalke 04Volksparkstadion: Hamburg SVWanda Metropolitano: Atletico Madrid34 The Allianz Arena will be making a return - as expectedRest of the worldBC Place Stadium: Vancouver WhitecapsCenturyLink Field: Seattle SoundersEstadio Azteca: Club AmericaKing Abdullah Sports City: Al Ittihad & Al AhliKing Fahd International Stadium: Al Hilal, Al Nassr & Al ShababLa Bombonera: Boca JuniorsEl Monumental: River PlateStubHub Center: LA GalaxySuita City Football Stadium: Gamba OsakaAre there any cheats? A cheat called '99OVR’ gives every single player in your team a 99 rating in every skill - and it could ruin FIFA 18.34 The hack has made its way on to the PC version, where access to the game's code is easierThis theoretically means that even bronze or silver players can be better than 93-rated Lionel Messi and 94-rated Cristiano Ronaldo.It’s also extremely damaging to Ultimate Team as it results in a 10K squad being better than a five million FUT-coin team.Now for the worst bit – it’s extremely hard to tell if someone is using the cheat until it’s too late.It's thought EA is aware of the matter and taking steps to eradicate the cheat.Reddit users have spotted that when you match against an opponent and their team comes up on the screen, a disconnect occurs.EA now registers player stats server side, so every one of those disconnects could be a cheater using 99OVR.Worringly, it took almost the entire of FIFA 17's lifespan for EA to find a workaround for the cheat. By that time, many normal players had abandoned the PC version of the game altogether.Given that there are forums devoted to finding out ways to hack the game, something tells us a version of the 99OVR cheat may rear its ugly head in FIFA 18 on PC.How much will it cost?FIFA 18 will cost around £49.99 - but given the demand, some outlets may undercut this.We expect the cheapest the game will go for at launch to be around £45.When will pre-orders start?FIFA 17 pre-orders have kicked off now.There are three editions: Ronaldo (Deluxe) and ICON (Super Deluxe) Editions. You can find more information by visiting the FIFA 18 website What is in each package?Icon Edition Play from September 26th with 3 Days Early AccessUp to 40 FIFA Ultimate Team Jumbo Premium Gold Packs (two per week over 20 weeks – worth up to $120)3 match FUT Team of the Week loan player (one three match loan player for 20 weeks)Cristiano Ronaldo FUT loan player for 5 matchesRonaldo Nazário FUT Icon loan player for 5 matches8 special edition FUT kits designed by FIFA soundtrack artistsDigital Only. Pre-order for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.Ronaldo Edition Play from September 26th with 3 Days Early AccessUp to 20 FIFA Ultimate Team Jumbo Premium Gold Packs (one per week for 20 weeks – worth up to $60)Cristiano Ronaldo FUT loan player for 5 matches8 special edition FUT kits designed by FIFA soundtrack artistsPre-order for PlayStation 4,  Xbox One, and  PCStandard Edition Up to 5 FIFA Ultimate Team Jumbo Premium Gold Packs (one per week for five weeks – worth up to $15)Cristiano Ronaldo FUT loan player for 5 matches8 special edition FUT kits designed by FIFA soundtrack artistsWhat package would you recommend?Personally, I wouldn't get tied up by Ronaldo loans etc. All many people will really care about is the game, so I'd go for the cheaper option.Just invest wisely and buy up players in the market who you feel will shoot up in value.WATCH: Dream Team Comedy Sketch - We all have mates that come up with these classic FIFA excuses[ooyala code=""NjZXcyYjE6xrPV8VseA-lNOkgrXAvBjD"" player_id=""63f267a0aae8493e9a2393eb94951149"" width=""1920"" height=""1080"" caption="""" auto=""true"" autoplay=""true""]Have you signed up to play fantasy football yet?If the answer is no you need to take a long, hard look at yourself.Because the Dream Team game - the UK's biggest fantasy football game - is back and better than ever this season.You've got a £50m budget to pick 11 players, with all the biggest new signings ready and raring to go ahead of a mouthwatering new Premier League campaign.So what are you waiting for?

Of course we feel depressed. In the meantime, body shaming and bullying are rife.Social media gives people such easy access that this problem has never been more ferocious, in your face and more instant.Getty - Contributor9 The pressure used to just come from fashion magazine which you could choose to ignoreAnd the internet offers a cloak of anonymity which seems to remove inhibition more effectively than a couple of Babychams.So our teenagers have been turned into “approval junkies”.If they post a picture that doesn’t get 100 likes in the first ten minutes, they’ve “failed”.If it actually gets negative comments it’s enough for them to go into hiding.Their self-esteem is directly linked to external opinion.And all too often it’s their appearance they seek approval on.When it comes to aspirations, we are asking our girls to aim too low.Who could blame them if they feel dispirited at how much time they are supposed to devote to trying to achieve a big a**e. How depressing is that?All the work we have done as feminists and we are still being valued, mainly, for the way we look.There aren’t enough decent role models for our girls.Reality TV is littered with women with “perfect” bodies.“Extreme surgery” — whether having ribs removed or fat injected into their bodies to create cartoon-like images bearing little resemblance to the bodies they were born with — has become positively mainstream.Alamy9 Now with the likes of Instagram this generation are unable to switch off from it allSocial media offers an irresistible window into other people’s lives and it’s almost impossible to turn away.But there’s nothing like looking at someone’s edited — and gilded — version of their life to realise that your own life is lacking.Maybe one answer is to take the phones away, but you might as well cut off their arms and legs.So the question is this: How can we inject some balance into young people’s lives and give them other aspirations?How do we give them self-esteem? Help them to value themselves for their ability rather than their looks? Make them more thick-skinned about criticism?How about this.Encourage them to do some voluntary work, think about other people — and leave their phone at home.Help them to do some work experience, find a mentor and — crucially — discover a sense of purpose.You can’t fight the tide, but you can turn away from it and try to go the other direction.Twenty is plenty, supermumMAMMA Mia!

165,The exotic holiday locations featured in Daniel Craig’s Bond films so far – and where he might be heading next,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/4264116/the-exotic-locations-featured-in-daniel-craigs-bond-films-so-far-and-where-he-might-be-headed-next/,"17th August 2017, 4:02 pm","WITH the chance to film in the world’s most glamorous locations, is it any wonder that Daniel Craig agreed to reprise his role as Bond for a fifth movie?The 49-year-old actor confirmed yesterday that he’ll play the world’s most famous spy for a fifth and final time.Handout14 The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul was used for a dramatic motorcycles chase scene in SkyfallSo to help you holiday like a secret agent, we’ve put together a list of the most exotic destinations from his movies so far - and our best guess as where he's headed next.Craig’s four Bond flicks have seen the film star jet set all over the globe, shooting explosive scenes in everywhere from Japan to Peru and Italy.The lucky actor has travelled to dozens of countries visiting icy mountaintops, arid deserts and everything in between.Casino Royale set the bar high in 2006 with shooting in the Bahamas, Venice and the Czech Republic - and the destinations only got more exotic from there.In Spectre, Craig’s latest outing, Bond travelled from the snow-covered peaks of Solden in Austria to the humid heat of Mexico City.Just how he knows what weather to pack for is anyone’s guess.In 2015 Craig caused a storm for saying, he had had enough of the role and would “rather slash my wrists” than do another Bond film.Perhaps the thought of a huge pay day helped change his mind but the jaw-dropping worldwide sets can't have hurt.Rex Features14 The ruins of Hashima Island was the set for a show down with Bond villain Raoul Silva in SkyfallThe next 007 film, the 25th in the series, is due out in November 2019, by which point Craig will be 51-years-old.Below, we’ve listed eight of our favourite filming locations from Craig’s films so far plus our guess for where he'll be headed next.Casino RoyaleVilla del Balbianello, Lenno, Lake Como, ItalyAlamy14 Tourists can pay for tours of the Villa del Balbianello overlooking Lake ComoThe Villa del Balbianello is a former monastery and private villa on the banks of Lake Como, Italy.Visitors can take tours of the property and its gardens for €16 (£15).In Casino Royale, the villa was used as a hospital where Bond was recuperating, playing host to one of the greatest moments of dialogue in a 007 film.Vesper Lynd: “James, I just want you to know that if all that was left of you was your smile and your little finger, you’d still be more of a man than anyone I’ve ever met.”Bond: “That’s because you know what I can do with my little finger.”The villa was also used for a wedding scene between Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.Grandhotel Pupp, Karlovy Vary, Czech RepublicAlamy14 The Grandhotel Pupp from Casino Royale is not really in MontenegroThe Grandhotel Pupp appears in the 2006 film Casino Royale as the Hotel Splendide in Montenegro.The 228-room luxury hotel is located in Karlovy Vary, a historic spa town that hosts the annual Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.The hotel includes a posh wellness centre with a pool and saunas as well as the iconic Casino used in the movie.Quantum of SolacePalio di Siena horse race, Piazza del Campo, Siena, ItalyAlamy14 The Palio di Siena featured in the opening of the 22nd James Bond movie, Quantum of SolaceThe Palio di Siena horse race features in the dramatic opening to Quantum of Solace, where Bond chases Mr White down into the sewers below the streets of Siena in Italy.Held twice a year, on July 2 and August 16 in honour of the Virgin Mary, the race has been held since at least 1644.Standing in the centre of the piazza to watch the race is free of charge but if you want a better view you’ll need to turn up early in the morning.ESO Hotel, Atacama Desert, ChileESO Hotel14 Unfortunately for tourists, this entire hotel is reserved for staff at the nearby observatoryIn Quantum of Solace’s dramatic finale, Bond catches up with Dominic Greene and General Medrano in an exotic eco-hotel in the desert.Interior shots, which re-imagined the rooms as more plush than in real life, were all filmed on a sound stage in London.GAME OF HOLIDAY HOMES Make a Game Of Thrones pilgrimage to the best filming locations this summerThe ESO Hotel is the living quarters for workers at the Paranal Observatory, an astronomical observatory operated by the European Southern Observatory in the Atacama Desert.Tours of the facility are available to visitors if requested at least three months in advance.Unfortunately, guests can’t stay the night in the hotel itself.SkyfallHashima Island, JapanAlamy14 Hashima Island can be reached by boat and is now open to the public as a tourist attractionIn Skyfall, this abandoned Japanese island is used as the secret headquarters of Raoul Silva, the Bond Villain played by Javier Bardem.Used for undersea coal mining, Hashima Island was established in 1887 and used as a labour camp for Chinese and Korean prisoners during World War Two.In 1959, the island contained the highest population density on earth but by 1974 the mine was closed and all of the residents left.Tourists can now visit the island, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, by boat from the mainland for about £35 per person.Grand Bazaar, Istanbul, TurkeyAlamy14 Istanbul's largest market, the Grand Bazaar was used for a chase scene in SkyfallThe opening chase scene from Skyfall sees James Bond ride a motorcycle across the rooftop of Istanbul's 15th-century Grand Bazaar.During the chase, Bond and the villain Patrice drive through an entrance called Büyuk Valide Han, on the edge of the sprawling complex.One of the largest and oldest covered markets in the world, the Grand Bazaar has 61 covered streets and over 4,000 shops attracting over a quarter of a million daily visitors.SpectreGran Hotel Ciudad de México, Mexico City, MexicoAlamy14 The cage-like elevators and the stained-glass ceiling of the Gran Hotel Ciudad de México have featured in two Bond filmsConsidered one of the top hotels in Mexico, the Gran Hotel Ciudad is famous for it’s old-world charm and Art Nouveau décor.The incredibly complicated tracking shot for the intro to Spectre shows off the hotel’s famous gilded open lift.Spectre wasn’t the first movie that featured the hotel or it’s ornate lift.Sam Mendes reused the location from Licence to Kill when it was used as the Hotel El Presidente.Ice Q Restaurant, Solden, AustriaIce Q14 Ice Q was transformed from a restaurant into a high-end clinic in the blockbuster SpectreUsed in Spectre as a posh health clinic from where the evil henchman Mr. Hinx kidnaps Dr. Madeleine Swann, the Ice Q restaurant is a modern restaurant made of glass and steel on the mountain in Solden, Austria.Solden’s nearby ultra-modern gondola and the panoramic Glacier Road with Europe‘s highest road tunnel, also feature in the following chase scene.Tourists can visit the Ice Q restaurant, which opened in 2013, year round. The building is 3048 meters above sea level with a 900 m² glass front that overlooks the Ötzt Mountains.Bond 25Getty - Contributor14 Dubrovnik could be the star of the next Bond film set for release in 2019Craig will be travelling to Croatia for his fifth movie, with filming rumoured to be happening in Dubrovnik the Island of Brac and Zagreb.What’s less clear is whether Croatia will get the chance to feature as itself or double for another country.Alamy14 The huge Diocletian's Palace which forms half of the old town of Split could be a great location for a chase sceneScriptwriters are rumoured to be basing part of the plot of the 1999 Bond thriller Never Dream of Dying by Raymond Benson, which doesn’t mention Croatia but does involve the French island of Corsica. The two locations share similar rocky coastlines and medieval towns so Croatia could be a cheaper stand in for Corsica or could be replacing it in the script entirely.Alamy14 Perhaps Bond will have time to visit some natural wonders such as the Skradinski Buk waterfallsCroatia has plenty of ruins that would make great locations for a shoot-out or car chase, such as the Roman 4th-century Diocletian's Palace in Split, Croatia.Or perhaps Bond will take a detour through some of the nation's national parks for a visit to some natural wonders such as Skradinski Buk, a mesmerising collection of 17 waterfalls.Never Dream of Dying features Bond battling a blind criminal genius at the head of an organisation called the Union.Getty - Contributor14 Craig could be headed east to Japan for his next adventureBond is also rumoured to be making a trip to Japan and the South of France.Perhaps we'll even see a return to the American South for a reunion with Sheriff J.W. Pepper.Or how about quick trip to space?THOMAS SHOOK What are my rights if Thomas Cook goes bust after I've booked my holiday? THEY'RE BACK!

SIGN UP HERE3 Well, both strikers have the same end-game potential when it comes to career mode at 86, mainly due to Morata having age on his side ready to enter his prime.In terms of Ultimate Team - Morata's arrival and Costa's exit does very little.They're both Spanish strikers meaning Morata will still have strong links to Chelsea and Spanish Premier League players.Plus, if fellow Spaniard Pedro has another stand-out season, the pair could form a lethal strike partnership.Getty Images3 Alvaro Morata returned to Real Madrid from Juventus as a result of a buy-back clauseMorata's added pace may be biggest factor felt by FIFA players, as we all know pace dictates everything.He's noticeably faster off the mark than Costa, with 79 acceleration compared to 74. This will help him beat the first man and open up space down the flanks.Costa trumps him when it comes to physicality and his ability to finish, but Morata's passing could help him create more opportunities.Interestingly, Morata's much cheaper than Costa  - coming in at around 3,000 FUT coins compared to 15,000.While we're certain this will go up in FIFA 18, we can't expect him to be too much more expensive - at least until the Spaniard proves himself.PA:Press Association3 Chelsea striker Diego Costa is closing in on a return to Atletico MadridMeanwhile, it looks as though Costa will be in FIFA 18 - after talks of a potential move to China seem to have dissipated.EA confirmed earlier in the year that the Chinese Super League was not going to feature in this year's game - which would have meant Costa, who's linked to a move back to Atletico Madrid, risked being omitted, too.Sign up to play Dream Team 2017/18 now"

SIGN UP HERECheck this out:FIFA 18 – Cristiano Ronaldo Free Kick - 360° Motion Capture360 degrees of Ronaldo 👀 🙌Posted by EA SPORTS FIFA on Wednesday, July 19, 2017One thing is for certain... Ronaldo will be back at his best on FIFA 18.Sign up to play Dream Team 2017/18 nowEverything you need to know about FIFA 18Let's kick off.21 Cristiano Ronaldo is the new face of FIFA 18So, have you played it?Yes, and we're very impressed.Why not take a look at our FIFA 18 early review.What platforms is it on?FIFA 18's lead consoles will be the Xbox One (Scorpio) and PS4 Pro.It'll also come on on Xbox One, Ps4, PS3, Xbox 360, PC and Nintendo Switch.Small print on FIFA 18's reveal trailer has revealed some key differences between the game and the Nintendo Switch version.The video includes a line of text that reads: ""Frostbite game engine technology and The Journey: Hunter Returns mode are available on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC platform versions only. Not all features available on all platforms.""In other words, it'll be a completely different game.21 FIFA 17 looked the part, but the Frostbite Engine is capable of so much moreSo, will it look better on current-gen platforms?In short, yes – but don’t expect a huge improvement. It'll be powered by the same engine.In fact, one gamer has filmed some footage of FIFA 18 at E3 and posted it on to FIFA Reddit.Speaking to Dream Team Gaming,  Frostbite Studio Director Jonas Skantz revealed: “I can assure you that Frostbite continues to be a true differentiator.""“With more and more games powered by Frostbite – whether it is FIFA, Battlefield, Mass Effect or others – our development teams can spend more time building new groundbreaking gameplay innovations.”FIFA 17 was the first game in the series to be powered by Frostbite – which replaced Ignite used the previous year.While graphics took a boost this year, especially facial and player animations, FIFA 18 will see more subtle improvements as it’ll run on the same Frostbite 4 engine.21 Player models looked impressive - but expect polygon count to be increased in FIFA 18Expect player movement and animation to look sharper – not to mention greater detail and likeness.Other peripheral graphical tweaks, such as improved crowd detail, will also be present.PS4 Pro owners and PC gamers will once again receive the best-looking versions of the game.The former will once again capitalise on 'Pro Mode' – allowing for increased detail and more stable framerate at above 1080p resolution.Pro Mode offered tangible improvements in FIFA 17, but this year, EA will have more time to push this even further and make greater use of Pro’s substantial GPU grunt.Tell us about the Xbox 360 and Ps3 versions - surely they'll be better than last year?Sadly, not. It won't feature The Journey or use the Frostbite engine.“Yes, it will be coming out on Xbox 360 and PS3 but is going to be a ‘Gold’ version”, EA SPORTS’ lead gameplay producer Sam Rivera told Dream Team Gaming.“So there will be updates in the rosters but nothing big, new – like the new engine. It’s just basically an update.”Rivera confirmed the game will run on Ignite – which has been used since FIFA 16.This means it will be almost identical to last year’s game and look noticeably worse than FIFA 18 on the Xbox One, PS4 and PC.Bringing The Journey to last-gen consoles would require recreating the entire experience using Ignite – a move that makes no sense from either a technical or commercial perspective.Still, that didn’t stop fans from expressing their anger at Alex Hunter’s omission on older consoles in FIFA 17.21 Last-gen console owners also missed out on The Journey in FIFA 17Last year, some didn’t realise until it was too late – and bought FIFA 17 on Xbox 360 and PS3 only to be disappointed that the key mode didn’t feature.Retailers were equally as confused, with Amazon.co.uk coming under fire for accidentally using screenshots from the current-gen version of the game on adverts for the Xbox 360 version.One wrote: “My son bought this as it clearly said it included journey mode unlike the standard version costed over 50 pounds. He is now bitterly disapointed having wasted his money this game is no better than fifa 15.”Another said: “This was purchased for my 12 year old out of his birthday money.“He was so excited when it arrived and looking forward to playing it, however this soon turned to bitter disappointment when he discovered that it did not include The Journey and therefore not much different from previous versions of FIFA.”Despite the lack of Frostbite and The Journey, FIFA 18 is currently being listed at £49.99 – the same price as the current-gen version.21 A screenshot of the Amazon page using the wrong imagery for the last-gen version of FIFA 17It’s not the first time Xbox 360 and Ps3 users have been handed a bad deal.The entire single-player campaign of Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 was omitted from last-gen consoles.PES, meanwhile, uses the Fox Engine, which is much more last-gen friendly.While it won’t look as good as the shiny new current-gen versions, Konami’s game will still perform well on older hardware, so could prove a better bet this year.Tell us about the Nintendo Switch versionThe relationship between FIFA and Nintendo is a strange one.When the Wii U launched back in 2012, it took three months for FIFA 13 to make its way on to the console.When it did finally arrive, it was lacking arguably the most popular mode, Ultimate Team - and gameplay was sub par compared with the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions.Subsequent FIFA games were scrapped from the Wii U, with EA focusing efforts on the then next-gen consoles and the ageing Wii.21 FIFA on the Switch lets you play your friends on the moveHowever, the arrival of the Nintendo Switch heralds a new fresh start for the relationship between the Japanese manufacturer and EA.Speaking at a FIFA 18 event in London last week, EA producer Sam Rivera reassured gamers the Switch version is more than just an afterthought.“The only thing I can tell you is that there’s a big team of people working on this,” he told Dream Team Gaming.“It’s being created in a very serious way – the gameplay, it’s fun and different.”In fact, if both companies play their cards right, the Switch version of FIFA 18 could be the most attractive proposition of the lot. Here's why.You'll be able to play FIFA 18 on the goThe Switch has already proven itself as a brilliant handheld companion, so being able to play the full game (not just the Web App) on the go will give this version the edge.Thankfully, FIFA has been 'custom built' for Nintendo's new hardware.It may not use the latest Frostbite technology but gameplay is sleek, responsive and runs at 60FPS.21 You can play mates by detaching the Joy Con controllersPlus, you're able to detach the Joy Con controllers and play a friend - although this can be a bit fiddly.A battery life of up to six hours makes it perfect for long journeys.It has Ultimate TeamAs long as you have Wifi you'll be able to play Ultimate Team and buy packs as you normally would.Champions won't feature but that's not the end of the world.Graphics and presentation Sure, it's not as crisp as the Xbox One, PS4 and PC versions of the game - but FIFA on the Switch is by no means ugly.EA producer Andrei Lazaresco told Eurogamer about how they made the most out of Switch's Nvidia Maxwell-based Tegra X1 chip.21 The Switch version will not feature The Journey: Hunter's Return - which will anger some Nintendo fans""We're using physical-based rendering,"" he said.""The crowds are 3D. The grass is 3D. The lighting is new. And on top of that you'll have Ultimate Team for the first time on Nintendo - and for the first time you'll be able to take it on the go.""You'll be able to play on a plane, on a bus, even from just a hotspot.""Sounds like a winner to us.It'll be easier than ever to meet new playersRight now, if you want to add a friend on the Switch you need to use an annoying 12 digit Friend Code. But that's all about to change.Nintendo confirmed to Polygon that more ways to add pals are on the way - using the likes of Twitter, Facebook and the simple Nintendo Network ID.Expect FIFA 18 to have a custom interface for adding players - although no details of this have been announced.What about Legends - are they making a return?FIFA 18 has ditched Xbox exclusive Legends in multi-platform Icons.As well as Ronaldo Nazario, the first wave of Icons will feature:PeleDiego MaradonaLev YashinThierry HenryDavid Beckham, Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldinho are also rumoured to be on the way.You can find out more information about FIFA 18 Icons hereWill it play the same as FIFA 17?FIFA 17 has come under fire for some aspects of its gameplay – but as FIFA 18 will be powered by the same engine, we doubt much will change here.Input delay – the time it takes for a button press to translate into an on-screen action – has led to some negative feedback in FIFA 17.There have also been claims of 'EAaids' or 'scripting', which refers to the game dynamically adjusting online matches to favour weaker players.21 Animation was sometimes clunky and unnatural in FIFA 17 - but we're confident EA will smooth things out in FIFA 18Whilst the former issue is a result of the game’s severs compensating for 'Ping' or connection strength variance between online players, we’d expect to see action taken over 'EAAids'.What other things do fans want to see addressed in FIFA 18?There's quite a few things that annoyed gamers with FIFA 17.Here are the main ones.Long Shots - from 45 yards These find the back of the net far too often.It's largely because goalkeeper AI isn't up to scratch, meaning they spend too often standing still before attempting a dive.The shots themselves are way too accurate - so incorporating more human error would make things more realistic.Keepers Mechanics and goal line technology In penalties, the keepers sometimes do not save the ball despite the fact they dive in the correct direction.During open gameplay, they also get confused about when they should punch or catch a ball - the former often resulting in the ball landing to an opponent.The goal-line technology system is also incredibly erratic.21 Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after netting a goal in the FIFA 18 trailerPlayer animationsWhen a player is fouled, the 'complain' animation takes far too long - taking them out of the game for a noticeable period of time.This needs to be shortened.Defensive AIThe CPU AI is far too good at defending, so much so that it's often more effective to put the controller down and let it do the work.This needs to be toned down so it doesn't feel that you're trying to beat the computer as well as the human opponent.Scrapping auto blocking and auto tackles would be welcome too.21 Cristiano Ronaldo in action in the latest FIFA 18 trailerCorners, Headers and chestingSome fans have reported that corners leave you too exposed to a counter because players don't get back fast enough to cover.Regarding headers, it seems the attacker always has the ability to step in front of the defender, making it easier for them to score regardless of stats.Adding more control to the aerial tussle would improve things no end.Chesting the ball is also inconsistent and in desperate need of more control.ServersThese have been slightly flaky throughout FIFA 17's lifespan, so greater optimisation especially during peak times would be welcome.Thankfully, EA revealed that they have a dedicated team of people tasked with ensuring the servers are much improved come FIFA 18.Players should also be kicked for inactivity if they put down the controller for long periods of time.If a game disconnects during a match, there needs to be a period where it tries to reconnect to the player until a certain time limit is hit.21 Crowds have been completely re-worked in FIFA 18 - and now show off a much wider range of animationRefereesThese are often cited as being too inconsistent - with officials often awarding fouls for very weak challenges.Cards need to given out more frequently, especially for slide tackles.The red card bug, where the ref will send the last defender off if they tug on an attacker's shirt, needs to be axed, too.When they release a trailer?EA Sports have released the trailer for the new game here - you can watch it here.They also released a Journey 2: Hunter Returns trailerWhen will it come out, and will there be a demo?If past years are anything to go by, the FIFA 18 demo will arrive on September 15 – two weeks before launch.The FIFA 17 demo dropped on September 13, with the full game arriving on September 27.  FIFA 16 followed the same pattern, with the demo arriving on September 8 and the game released on the 22nd.So, what’s in the demo?If it’s the same build EA have been showing off at their preview events, you’ll be able to play as Manchester United, Manchester City, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, PSG Juventus, Gamba Osaka, Lyon, Inter, Seattle Sounders and Tigres in the demo.You’ll also likely be able to play through the first part of The Journey: Hunter Returns – although we wouldn’t doing that unless you’ve played the first one.No sweat, here’s what happens at the end of The Journey  – if you won’t have time to play through it.Will Cristiano Ronaldo still be the best player?It’s been an incredible year for the Portuguese, so he'll definitely remain the game’s best player in FIFA 18.Some believe he may have a stats downgrade, though - especially with regards to his pace and dribbling.Lionel Messi, who has been in blistering form of late, will keep second spot.I can't wait until the demo drops - is there any way I can play FIFA 18 earlier?You may not need to wait until September to get you hands on the game.That's because EA is doing another closed beta this year - due to kick off around August 18.Select members of the FIFA community - from YouTubers to professional gamers - will be invited to play on the game and submit feedback.But there's an outside chance you could get in on the action, too.21 The FIFA 17 closed beta invite was circulated at around this time last yearTo give yourself the best shot, you're going need to have an EA account - then, head to email settings and check the box that says you want to receive promotional materials.If you're lucky enough to receive an invite, you'll be able to play an early version of the game.It's worth mentioning that the screen will feature a watermark - complete with your gamer tag. This is to stop you from taking screen shots or streaming the game - both of which will result in account ban.21 The closed beta will feature a watermark with your gamertag on there to stop you streaming or taking screenshotsFor those who can't get their hands on the closed beta then you'll have to wait for the demo, which drops a few weeks later.It was too late for one man kick offs to feature in FIFA 17 - but will they come along this year?The change in football laws came into effect at the start of the 2016/17 season, but too late for EA Sports to implement the change into FIFA 17.Fortunately, they have included the new rule into the game, meaning players will be using the one-man kick-off system in all matches.Dream Team was given the chance to play the new game, and experienced for ourselves the one-man kick-off format.Of course, we tried our best to kick it all the way back to the keeper, but we couldn’t do it in the build of the game we played (doubtless someone will come up with a YouTube video showing how to at a later date).21 Stadiums are much more detailed in FIFA 18But we were able to pass it back to the central defenders, wide midfielders, as well as just knock it back to the other forward.We also asked FIFA’s Lead Gameplay Producer Sam Rivera how frustrating it was that football changed the kick-off laws, just days after FIFA 17 had gone to press.He said: “I remember we talked about whether or not we could get it into the last game, but it was impossible for us to do it.“It’s a nice addition that you see in real life, how it works is basically we tried to find out which teams were doing one player kick offs and who weren’t, but we couldn’t find find any patterns.“So we just made it so that if you start the game with a one player kick off, you carry on the whole game with it whenever you take a kick-off.”Will the Chinese Super League feature?EA confirmed to Fox Sports that the league, arguably the fastest growing and richest in the world, will not feature in FIFA 18.EA SPORTS' lead gameplay producer Sam Rivera said: ""Our intention with FIFA is to bring the best leagues in the world.""Yes, we thought about the Chinese league, but for now the Super League will not be included in FIFA 18 .""Gamers have been calling on EA to include the Chinese Super League for months after a string of high-profile players made the move overseas.Earlier in the year, Jiangsu Suning’s Alex Teixeira Santos posted a picture on Instagram, with the caption: “Official presentation for FIFA 18 new jersey for the 2017 season.”Some took this to be a sign the league was set to be included - but it's clear now this is not the case.Will The Journey feature again? (SPOILER ALERT)Yes, it's called Hunter Returns.The Journey 2 will still follow the life and career of Alex Hunter, and no, you won’t be able to be anyone else.Unfortunately for those hoping to put themselves in the game, or play with a player of their choice, you still have to be Alex Hunter.Here's what we know:The story line decisions are much broaderLast season’s game mode saw the story line quite narrow, with limited decision making.It was the first time EA Sports had entered in a story mode like this, so we can forgive them, but this time round the story line is much, much broader, and the decisions you make will make a much greater difference.Whereas most of us ended up winning the FA Cup with our Hunters in FIFA 17, it’ll be interesting to see where our character can end up once we’ve taken different decisions from our mates.21 A screenshot from the FIFA 17's The JourneyThe gameplay and mechanics are virtually the sameWe haven’t had a chance to play the whole thing, far from it, but it looks as if though they’ve maintained the things we enjoyed most from The Journey.So decisions of fiery, cool or moderate stay, you’ll have to earn ratings in training and matches to excel, and scenes will happen sporadically through the story.You can modify your Alex Hunter to have blonde hair and tattoos…And the rest. You’ll be able to change the look of your Alex Hunter to have a vast array of different hairstyles, tattoos, tracksuits and so on.There is apparently ‘hundreds’ of options to choose from, which will be an exciting change.Read more about the changes you’ll be able to make to your character here.Dream Team21 How we think Alex Hunter could appear next seasonWill you be able to start where you left off in FIFA 17?That’s one thing we’ve not been told as yet, but it looks likely that you’ll have to start afresh with your new Hunter in this game.Presumably the thinking behind this (if it were the case) will be that because everyone ended their Hunter in a slightly different way but broadly on a similar path (winning the FA Cup, getting a 75 FUT card etc.), it would make more sense to just wipe the slate clean.Slightly annoying for those who became fond of their Hunter, but probably it’s all for the best.Does Alex Hunter get a girlfriend?Hmm, now this one could get interesting.At the FIFA 18 preview event in May, we watched a presentation on The Journey 2, in which an image of a woman, probably a similar age to Hunter, popped up.The guys from EA Sports pointed it out, said they won't tell us exactly who it was, before adding that there were 'a lot of new characters' that you come across and interact with.We can't say it definitively, but certainly one to watch.21 Marco Reus chats with Hunter in FIFA 17's The JourneyCristiano Ronaldo features in it, and quite heavilyCR7 is the real star of FIFA 18, given what we've seen of the game so far.It's no different in The Journey 2, and we've seen images and clips of Cristiano appearing in a scene alongside Hunter.Considering he's the cover star, the Real Madrid man will feature prominently in the game across the board.Speaking of which...Alex Hunter gets offered a move to Real Madrid?Whether or not this is as a result of a few decisions and good performances going right for your character, but we've witnessed a scene in which Hunter's agent storms into his kitchen/dining room/lounge (that hasn't changed) and offers him a move to Los Blancos.That's all we'll say about it here, you can read all about the scenes we've played here.You can play local multiplayer in your gameThis is a lovely little addition - you'll now be able to play The Journey alongside your friends.When you're met with the start game screen, you can play local multiplayer mode, meaning you can blame your friend sat next to you for not slipping in Hunter to secure a goal an a much-needed 7.0 rating.Oh, and Hunter now his own Twitter account.Yep, Hunter has joined Twitter... which is leading to some interesting results.The account, @MrAlexHunter, was started by EA as a means of ramping up PR ahead of the launch of FIFA 18 in September.It's a nice idea in theory, but in reality poor old Alex is getting torn to shreds.Largely because he's a fictional video game character and is little more than a bundle of pixels with no soul.Will free kicks and penalties stay the same?Penalties won't change much, but free kicks could see an overhaul.The new “momentum” system that governs the set-pieces is incredibly hard to master and has been panned by FIFA players.As a result, we’d expect this to revert back to the more “traditional” shot power and curl mechanic.21 Penalties can be hard to master - but can be prone to erratic goalkeeper AIThe system works wonders for penalties, though – allowing for much more control over shot placement and power.Goalkeeper AI during spot kicks is often found wanting, so expect EA to address this.When will EA release some more information about the game?EA is planning an Ultimate Team ‘showcase’ at this year’s Gamescom convention in August.FIFA 18 creative director Matt Prior revealed the publisher will use the conference in Cologne as a springboard for FIFA 18 news about the popular mode.“Ordinary we don’t announce much about Ultimate Team around this time because we’re in the run up to Gamescom – that’s our big FUT showcase,” he said at a FIFA 18 event in London.What will be the best new feature in FIFA 18?Dynamic weather will almost certainly feature in FIFA 18.Need For Speed (2015) and Battlefield 1 -are both powered by the same engine and make use of unpredictable in-game weather systems.Speaking to Metro last year, EA DICE’s Patrick Bach explained why weather is so much more than just a 'pretty effect'. Battlefield 1 uses a dynamic weather system - which affects gameplay“We often talk about these different dimensions in Battlefield, where you have the rock, paper, scissors and then you marry that with the destruction and you create unpredictability from different angles. And with the layer of weather we actually change the way you play in a very drastic way,” he said.CLAIM YOUR FREE £10 BET WITH SUN BETS“So, if you have the tactics of being a sniper and it starts to rain then you probably have to change tactics. And the same with fighter planes, once the fog rolls in it’s like, ‘Okay, this is not as effective anymore, so I probably need to go back on the ground’.“It’s not only a pretty effect, it actually changes the way you play the game.”Dynamic weather would add a whole new layer of tactics to gameplay in FIFA.For example, weather taking a turn for the worse could negatively affect player ground speed, passing accuracy and injury probability.Players could fall over more easily, goalkeepers could be more likely to fumble fast shots… the list is endless, and would all help add an extra level of realism to the game.Are there any cheats? A cheat called '99OVR’ gives every single player in your team a 99 rating in every skill - and it could ruin FIFA 18.21 The hack has made its way on to the PC version, where access to the game's code is easierThis theoretically means that even bronze or silver players can be better than 93-rated Lionel Messi and 94-rated Cristiano Ronaldo.It’s also extremely damaging to Ultimate Team as it results in a 10K squad being better than a five million FUT-coin team.Now for the worst bit – it’s extremely hard to tell if someone is using the cheat until it’s too late.It's thought EA is aware of the matter and taking steps to eradicate the cheat.Reddit users have spotted that when you match against an opponent and their team comes up on the screen, a disconnect occurs.EA now registers player stats server side, so every one of those disconnects could be a cheater using 99OVR.Worringly, it took almost the entire of FIFA 17's lifespan for EA to find a workaround for the cheat. By that time, many normal players had abandoned the PC version of the game altogether.Given that there are forums devoted to finding out ways to hack the game, something tells us a version of the 99OVR cheat may rear its ugly head in FIFA 18 on PC.How much will it cost?FIFA 18 will cost around £49.99 - but given the demand, some outlets may undercut this.We expect the cheapest the game will go for at launch to be around £45.When will pre-orders start?FIFA 17 pre-orders have kicked off now.There are three editions: Ronaldo (Deluxe) and ICON (Super Deluxe) Editions. You can find more information by visiting the FIFA 18 website What is in each package?Icon Edition Play from September 26th with 3 Days Early AccessUp to 40 FIFA Ultimate Team Jumbo Premium Gold Packs (two per week over 20 weeks – worth up to $120)3 match FUT Team of the Week loan player (one three match loan player for 20 weeks)Cristiano Ronaldo FUT loan player for 5 matchesRonaldo Nazário FUT Icon loan player for 5 matches8 special edition FUT kits designed by FIFA soundtrack artistsDigital Only. Pre-order for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.Ronaldo Edition Play from September 26th with 3 Days Early AccessUp to 20 FIFA Ultimate Team Jumbo Premium Gold Packs (one per week for 20 weeks – worth up to $60)Cristiano Ronaldo FUT loan player for 5 matches8 special edition FUT kits designed by FIFA soundtrack artistsPre-order for PlayStation 4,  Xbox One, and  PCStandard Edition Up to 5 FIFA Ultimate Team Jumbo Premium Gold Packs (one per week for five weeks – worth up to $15)Cristiano Ronaldo FUT loan player for 5 matches8 special edition FUT kits designed by FIFA soundtrack artists"

The Chinese option was not one he ever truly craved.As for the big guns in the Premier League... who of those considered serious title contenders was going to enter into negotiations?PA:Press Association14 Ronald Koeman has not hidden his desire to bring Rooney back to EvertonNews Group Newspapers Ltd14 But Everton will not be getting the same Rooney that burst onto the scene with them as a teenagerAP:Associated Press14 Wayne Rooney got off to a dream start for United in 2004 when he scored a hat-trick against Fenerbahce on his debutNot on the basis of the last 12 months.But Toffees boss Ronald Koeman never hid his desire to take 31-year-old Rooney “home”.He saw something still there which could push his club on from their seventh-placed finish last term.Rooney said after lifting the Europa League trophy in May that he had a big decision to make.In truth it had already been made for him last October by United boss Jose Mourinho.It was then that SunSport revealed how Mourinho had told his captain that if he wanted regular first-team football, he would have to look for it elsewhere.It was the beginning of the end for Rooney.Mourinho’s planning for the future was to be without him. Rooney may have lifted two major trophies last season but he did not play any part in United’s EFL Cup final triumph over Southampton.And he was only brought on to the pitch in Stockholm in the Europa League final with a minute to go and with victory assured as the Red Devils  led  Ajax 2-0.To be fair to Rooney, he celebrated both triumphs as if he had played and influenced the result.He was happy for his team-mates, still proud to be their captain - but inside there will have been sorrow.Sorrow that, after being the main man at the club for so long, he was now an afterthought, no longer needed.Getty Images14 Wayne Rooney has won countless honours with Manchester UnitedPA:Press Association14 Wayne Rooney failed to get onto the pitch during United's EFL Cup win last seasonGetty Images14 Wayne Rooney only got on for the final few minutes of the Europa League victory over AjaxThe club’s record goalscorer was being shown the door.The fighter inside him was telling Rooney he could come back, but the team-sheets were increasingly telling him he could not.He had publicly accepted two summers ago that he was no longer the same Wayne Rooney that flooded the Premier League archives with goals of genius.He believed he could reinvent himself in midfield where that sudden burst of pace which he had lost would not be needed.But others have galloped past him.Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Marcus Rashford, Ander Herrera, Paul Pogba — these are now the names filling the roles he hoped might lengthen his United career.Too often last season he was losing possession and misplacing passes with fans groaning.

188,FIFA 18: Why Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang may not be on FIFA 18,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/gaming/3916814/fifa-18-why-pierre-emerick-aubameyang-may-not-be-on-fifa-18/,"29th June 2017, 10:13 am","FIFA 18 gamers may not be able to play with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.The Gabonese international, 28, is strongly linked to a £70million move to Chinese Super League side Tianjin Quanjian.However, EA confirmed to Fox Sports that the league, arguably the fastest growing and richest in the world, will not feature in FIFA 18.Gabon are not in the game either, putting Aubameyang at high risk of the chop.Reuters19 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is wanted by a number of Europe's big guns but is linked to a move to ChinaEA SPORTS' lead gameplay producer Sam Rivera said: ""Our intention with FIFA is to bring the best leagues in the world.""Yes, we thought about the Chinese league, but for now the Super League will not be included in FIFA 18 .""Hulk and Oscar won't be playable for their clubs either but will likely still feature as part of the Brazil squad.Gamers have been calling on EA to include the Chinese Super League for months after a string of high-profile players made the move overseas.Earlier in the year, Jiangsu Suning’s Alex Teixeira Santos posted a picture on Instagram, with the caption: “Official presentation for FIFA 18 new jersey for the 2017 season.”Some took this to be a sign the league was set to be included - but it's clear now this is not the case.19 The Instagram post from Teixeira hinted that the CSL would be included - but EA has confirmed it will not featureSo, what's FIFA 18 like to play?We played the game at a preview event and left feeling very impressed.Why not take a look at our FIFA 18 early review.What platforms is it on?FIFA 18's lead consoles will be the Xbox One (Scorpio) and PS4 Pro.It'll also come on on Xbox One, Ps4, PS3, Xbox 360, PC and Nintendo Switch.Small print on FIFA 18's reveal trailer has revealed some key differences between the game and the Nintendo Switch version.The video includes a line of text that reads: ""Frostbite game engine technology and The Journey: Hunter Returns mode are available on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC platform versions only. Not all features available on all platforms.""In other words, it'll be a completely different game.19 FIFA 17 looked the part, but the Frostbite Engine is capable of so much moreSo, will it look better on current-gen platforms?In short, yes – but don’t expect a huge improvement. It'll be powered by the same engine.In fact, one gamer has filmed some footage of FIFA 18 at E3 and posted it on to FIFA Reddit.Speaking to Dream Team Gaming,  Frostbite Studio Director Jonas Skantz revealed: “I can assure you that Frostbite continues to be a true differentiator.""“With more and more games powered by Frostbite – whether it is FIFA, Battlefield, Mass Effect or others – our development teams can spend more time building new groundbreaking gameplay innovations.”FIFA 17 was the first game in the series to be powered by Frostbite – which replaced Ignite used the previous year.While graphics took a boost this year, especially facial and player animations, FIFA 18 will see more subtle improvements as it’ll run on the same Frostbite 4 engine.19 Player models looked impressive - but expect polygon count to be increased in FIFA 18Expect player movement and animation to look sharper – not to mention greater detail and likeness.Other peripheral graphical tweaks, such as improved crowd detail, will also be present.PS4 Pro owners and PC gamers will once again receive the best-looking versions of the game.The former will once again capitalise on 'Pro Mode' – allowing for increased detail and more stable framerate at above 1080p resolution.Pro Mode offered tangible improvements in FIFA 17, but this year, EA will have more time to push this even further and make greater use of Pro’s substantial GPU grunt.Tell us about the Xbox 360 and Ps3 versions - surely they'll be better than last year?Sadly, not. It won't feature The Journey or use the Frostbite engine.“Yes, it will be coming out on Xbox 360 and PS3 but is going to be a ‘Gold’ version”, EA SPORTS’ lead gameplay producer Sam Rivera told Dream Team Gaming.“So there will be updates in the rosters but nothing big, new – like the new engine. It’s just basically an update.”Rivera confirmed the game will run on Ignite – which has been used since FIFA 16.This means it will be almost identical to last year’s game and look noticeably worse than FIFA 18 on the Xbox One, PS4 and PC.Bringing The Journey to last-gen consoles would require recreating the entire experience using Ignite – a move that makes no sense from either a technical or commercial perspective.Still, that didn’t stop fans from expressing their anger at Alex Hunter’s omission on older consoles in FIFA 17.19 Last-gen console owners also missed out on The Journey in FIFA 17Last year, some didn’t realise until it was too late – and bought FIFA 17 on Xbox 360 and PS3 only to be disappointed that the key mode didn’t feature.Retailers were equally as confused, with Amazon.co.uk coming under fire for accidentally using screenshots from the current-gen version of the game on adverts for the Xbox 360 version.One wrote: “My son bought this as it clearly said it included journey mode unlike the standard version costed over 50 pounds. He is now bitterly disapointed having wasted his money this game is no better than fifa 15.”Another said: “This was purchased for my 12 year old out of his birthday money.“He was so excited when it arrived and looking forward to playing it, however this soon turned to bitter disappointment when he discovered that it did not include The Journey and therefore not much different from previous versions of FIFA.”Despite the lack of Frostbite and The Journey, FIFA 18 is currently being listed at £49.99 – the same price as the current-gen version.19 A screenshot of the Amazon page using the wrong imagery for the last-gen version of FIFA 17It’s not the first time Xbox 360 and Ps3 users have been handed a bad deal.The entire single-player campaign of Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 was omitted from last-gen consoles.PES, meanwhile, uses the Fox Engine, which is much more last-gen friendly.While it won’t look as good as the shiny new current-gen versions, Konami’s game will still perform well on older hardware, so could prove a better bet this year.Tell us about the Nintendo Switch versionThe relationship between FIFA and Nintendo is a strange one.When the Wii U launched back in 2012, it took three months for FIFA 13 to make its way on to the console.When it did finally arrive, it was lacking arguably the most popular mode, Ultimate Team - and gameplay was sub par compared with the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions.Subsequent FIFA games were scrapped from the Wii U, with EA focusing efforts on the then next-gen consoles and the ageing Wii.19 FIFA on the Switch lets you play your friends on the moveHowever, the arrival of the Nintendo Switch heralds a new fresh start for the relationship between the Japanese manufacturer and EA.Speaking at a FIFA 18 event in London last week, EA producer Sam Rivera reassured gamers the Switch version is more than just an afterthought.“The only thing I can tell you is that there’s a big team of people working on this,” he told Dream Team Gaming.“It’s being created in a very serious way – the gameplay, it’s fun and different.”In fact, if both companies play their cards right, the Switch version of FIFA 18 could be the most attractive proposition of the lot. Here's why.You'll be able to play FIFA 18 on the goThe Switch has already proven itself as a brilliant handheld companion, so being able to play the full game (not just the Web App) on the go will give this version the edge.Thankfully, FIFA has been 'custom built' for Nintendo's new hardware.It may not use the latest Frostbite technology but gameplay is sleek, responsive and runs at 60FPS.19 You can play mates by detaching the Joy Con controllersPlus, you're able to detach the Joy Con controllers and play a friend - although this can be a bit fiddly.A battery life of up to six hours makes it perfect for long journeys.It has Ultimate TeamAs long as you have Wifi you'll be able to play Ultimate Team and buy packs as you normally would.Champions won't feature but that's not the end of the world.Graphics and presentation Sure, it's not as crisp as the Xbox One, PS4 and PC versions of the game - but FIFA on the Switch is by no means ugly.EA producer Andrei Lazaresco told Eurogamer about how they made the most out of Switch's Nvidia Maxwell-based Tegra X1 chip.19 The Switch version will not feature The Journey: Hunter's Return - which will anger some Nintendo fans""We're using physical-based rendering,"" he said.""The crowds are 3D. The grass is 3D. The lighting is new. And on top of that you'll have Ultimate Team for the first time on Nintendo - and for the first time you'll be able to take it on the go.""You'll be able to play on a plane, on a bus, even from just a hotspot.""Sounds like a winner to us.It'll be easier than ever to meet new playersRight now, if you want to add a friend on the Switch you need to use an annoying 12 digit Friend Code. But that's all about to change.Nintendo confirmed to Polygon that more ways to add pals are on the way - using the likes of Twitter, Facebook and the simple Nintendo Network ID.Expect FIFA 18 to have a custom interface for adding players - although no details of this have been announced.What about Legends - are they making a return?FIFA 18 has ditched Xbox exclusive Legends in multi-platform Icons.As well as Ronaldo Nazario, the first wave of Icons will feature:PeleDiego MaradonaLev YashinThierry HenryDavid Beckham, Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldinho are also rumoured to be on the way.You can find out more information about FIFA 18 Icons hereWill it play the same as FIFA 17?FIFA 17 has come under fire for some aspects of its gameplay – but as FIFA 18 will be powered by the same engine, we doubt much will change here.Input delay – the time it takes for a button press to translate into an on-screen action – has led to some negative feedback in FIFA 17.There have also been claims of 'EAaids' or 'scripting', which refers to the game dynamically adjusting online matches to favour weaker players.19 Animation was sometimes clunky and unnatural in FIFA 17 - but we're confident EA will smooth things out in FIFA 18Whilst the former issue is a result of the game’s severs compensating for 'Ping' or connection strength variance between online players, we’d expect to see action taken over 'EAAids'.What other things do fans want to see addressed in FIFA 18?There's quite a few things that annoyed gamers with FIFA 17.Here are the main ones.Long Shots - from 45 yards These find the back of the net far too often.It's largely because goalkeeper AI isn't up to scratch, meaning they spend too often standing still before attempting a dive.The shots themselves are way too accurate - so incorporating more human error would make things more realistic.Keepers Mechanics and goal line technology In penalties, the keepers sometimes do not save the ball despite the fact they dive in the correct direction.During open gameplay, they also get confused about when they should punch or catch a ball - the former often resulting in the ball landing to an opponent.The goal-line technology system is also incredibly erratic.19 Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after netting a goal in the FIFA 18 trailerPlayer animationsWhen a player is fouled, the 'complain' animation takes far too long - taking them out of the game for a noticeable period of time.This needs to be shortened.Defensive AIThe CPU AI is far too good at defending, so much so that it's often more effective to put the controller down and let it do the work.This needs to be toned down so it doesn't feel that you're trying to beat the computer as well as the human opponent.Scrapping auto blocking and auto tackles would be welcome too.19 Cristiano Ronaldo in action in the latest FIFA 18 trailerCorners, Headers and chestingSome fans have reported that corners leave you too exposed to a counter because players don't get back fast enough to cover.Regarding headers, it seems the attacker always has the ability to step in front of the defender, making it easier for them to score regardless of stats.Adding more control to the aerial tussle would improve things no end.Chesting the ball is also inconsistent and in desperate need of more control.ServersThese have been slightly flaky throughout FIFA 17's lifespan, so greater optimisation especially during peak times would be welcome.Thankfully, EA revealed that they have a dedicated team of people tasked with ensuring the servers are much improved come FIFA 18.Players should also be kicked for inactivity if they put down the controller for long periods of time.If a game disconnects during a match, there needs to be a period where it tries to reconnect to the player until a certain time limit is hit.19 Crowds have been completely re-worked in FIFA 18 - and now show off a much wider range of animationRefereesThese are often cited as being too inconsistent - with officials often awarding fouls for very weak challenges.Cards need to given out more frequently, especially for slide tackles.The red card bug, where the ref will send the last defender off if they tug on an attacker's shirt, needs to be axed, too.When they release a trailer?EA Sports have released the trailer for the new game here - you can watch it here.They also released a Journey 2: Hunter Returns trailerWhen will it come out, and will there be a demo?If past years are anything to go by, the FIFA 18 demo will arrive on September 15 – two weeks before launch.The FIFA 17 demo dropped on September 13, with the full game arriving on September 27.  FIFA 16 followed the same pattern, with the demo arriving on September 8 and the game released on the 22nd.So, what’s in the demo?If it’s the same build EA have been showing off at their preview events, you’ll be able to play as Manchester United, Manchester City, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, PSG Juventus, Gamba Osaka, Lyon, Inter, Seattle Sounders and Tigres in the demo.You’ll also likely be able to play through the first part of The Journey: Hunter Returns – although we wouldn’t doing that unless you’ve played the first one.No sweat, here’s what happens at the end of The Journey  – if you won’t have time to play through it.Will Cristiano Ronaldo still be the best player?It’s been an incredible year for the Portuguese, so he'll definitely remain the game’s best player in FIFA 18.Some believe he may have a stats downgrade, though - especially with regards to his pace and dribbling.Lionel Messi, who has been in blistering form of late, will keep second spot.Who will be the cover star?Cristiano Ronaldo is the cover star - marking the end of an incredible season for the 32 year-old.On the news, Ronaldo said: ""It is a real pleasure to be on the cover of FIFA 18, It's a great feeling and I am grateful to have been chosen.""19 Ronaldo is the new face of FIFA 18 - despite claims that Paul Pogba was in contentionBut what happens if he leaves Real Madrid?If the 32-year-old was to leave the club, FIFA 18 risks being severely outdated before it even hits the shelves.Not only that, but EA would have to change the cover star at short notice, meaning the original September 29 release date could be put back.While no offers for the star are on the table, EA is likely poised for any movement and have a contingency plan in place should Ronaldo leave Los Blancos.Manchester United had reportedly been interested in pursuing the Portuguese forward but last night pulled out, opting to focus on his cheaper teammate, Alvaro Morata.Ronaldo is keen to leave the La Liga champions after Spanish tax authorities started an investigation into his tax affairs.It was too late for one man kick offs to feature in FIFA 17 - but will they come along this year?The change in football laws came into effect at the start of the 2016/17 season, but too late for EA Sports to implement the change into FIFA 17.Fortunately, they have included the new rule into the game, meaning players will be using the one-man kick-off system in all matches.Dream Team was given the chance to play the new game, and experienced for ourselves the one-man kick-off format.Of course, we tried our best to kick it all the way back to the keeper, but we couldn’t do it in the build of the game we played (doubtless someone will come up with a YouTube video showing how to at a later date).19 Stadiums are much more detailed in FIFA 18But we were able to pass it back to the central defenders, wide midfielders, as well as just knock it back to the other forward.We also asked FIFA’s Lead Gameplay Producer Sam Rivera how frustrating it was that football changed the kick-off laws, just days after FIFA 17 had gone to press.He said: “I remember we talked about whether or not we could get it into the last game, but it was impossible for us to do it.“It’s a nice addition that you see in real life, how it works is basically we tried to find out which teams were doing one player kick offs and who weren’t, but we couldn’t find find any patterns.“So we just made it so that if you start the game with a one player kick off, you carry on the whole game with it whenever you take a kick-off.”Will The Journey feature again? (SPOILER ALERT)Yes, it's called Hunter Returns.The Journey 2 will still follow the life and career of Alex Hunter, and no, you won’t be able to be anyone else.Unfortunately for those hoping to put themselves in the game, or play with a player of their choice, you still have to be Alex Hunter.Here's what we know:The story line decisions are much broaderLast season’s game mode saw the story line quite narrow, with limited decision making.It was the first time EA Sports had entered in a story mode like this, so we can forgive them, but this time round the story line is much, much broader, and the decisions you make will make a much greater difference.Whereas most of us ended up winning the FA Cup with our Hunters in FIFA 17, it’ll be interesting to see where our character can end up once we’ve taken different decisions from our mates.19 A screenshot from the FIFA 17's The JourneyThe gameplay and mechanics are virtually the sameWe haven’t had a chance to play the whole thing, far from it, but it looks as if though they’ve maintained the things we enjoyed most from The Journey.So decisions of fiery, cool or moderate stay, you’ll have to earn ratings in training and matches to excel, and scenes will happen sporadically through the story.You can modify your Alex Hunter to have blonde hair and tattoos…And the rest. You’ll be able to change the look of your Alex Hunter to have a vast array of different hairstyles, tattoos, tracksuits and so on.There is apparently ‘hundreds’ of options to choose from, which will be an exciting change.Read more about the changes you’ll be able to make to your character here.Dream Team19 How we think Alex Hunter could appear next seasonWill you be able to start where you left off in FIFA 17?That’s one thing we’ve not been told as yet, but it looks likely that you’ll have to start afresh with your new Hunter in this game.Presumably the thinking behind this (if it were the case) will be that because everyone ended their Hunter in a slightly different way but broadly on a similar path (winning the FA Cup, getting a 75 FUT card etc.), it would make more sense to just wipe the slate clean.Slightly annoying for those who became fond of their Hunter, but probably it’s all for the best.Does Alex Hunter get a girlfriend?Hmm, now this one could get interesting.At the FIFA 18 preview event in May, we watched a presentation on The Journey 2, in which an image of a woman, probably a similar age to Hunter, popped up.The guys from EA Sports pointed it out, said they won't tell us exactly who it was, before adding that there were 'a lot of new characters' that you come across and interact with.We can't say it definitively, but certainly one to watch.19 Marco Reus chats with Hunter in FIFA 17's The JourneyCristiano Ronaldo features in it, and quite heavilyCR7 is the real star of FIFA 18, given what we've seen of the game so far.It's no different in The Journey 2, and we've seen images and clips of Cristiano appearing in a scene alongside Hunter.Considering he's the cover star, the Real Madrid man will feature prominently in the game across the board.Speaking of which...Alex Hunter gets offered a move to Real Madrid?Whether or not this is as a result of a few decisions and good performances going right for your character, but we've witnessed a scene in which Hunter's agent storms into his kitchen/dining room/lounge (that hasn't changed) and offers him a move to Los Blancos.That's all we'll say about it here, you can read all about the scenes we've played here.You can play local multiplayer in your gameThis is a lovely little addition - you'll now be able to play The Journey alongside your friends.When you're met with the start game screen, you can play local multiplayer mode, meaning you can blame your friend sat next to you for not slipping in Hunter to secure a goal an a much-needed 7.0 rating.That's pretty much what we've seen so far of The Journey 2 - we'll post more as it comes.Will free kicks and penalties stay the same?Penalties won't change much, but free kicks could see an overhaul.The new “momentum” system that governs the set-pieces is incredibly hard to master and has been panned by FIFA players.As a result, we’d expect this to revert back to the more “traditional” shot power and curl mechanic.19 Penalties can be hard to master - but can be prone to erratic goalkeeper AIThe system works wonders for penalties, though – allowing for much more control over shot placement and power.Goalkeeper AI during spot kicks is often found wanting, so expect EA to address this.When will EA release some more information about the game?EA is planning an Ultimate Team ‘showcase’ at this year’s Gamescom convention in August.FIFA 18 creative director Matt Prior revealed the publisher will use the conference in Cologne as a springboard for FIFA 18 news about the popular mode.“Ordinary we don’t announce much about Ultimate Team around this time because we’re in the run up to Gamescom – that’s our big FUT showcase,” he said at a FIFA 18 event in London."

But after being blamed for both goals in Scotland's shock 2-2 draw, he is losing his grasp on that spot too.Manchester United and West Ham are believed to be interested - and Hart needs to make the move, and fast.Left-back - Luke ShawSince Jose Mourinho took over at Manchester United, it has appeared that Luke Shaw is not his favourite player.After breaking his leg then suffering other injury problems, Shaw has not had it easy since he joined the club from Southampton for £30million.But Mourinho has blasted the way the 21-year-old has trained since he took over, and has been less-than impressed with his performances on the pitch.It appears to be a bit of a ""too much too soon"" for Shaw at United, and he could be on the radar of Spurs and  boss Mauricio Pochettino - especially if he loses Danny Rose.Getty Images10 Luke Shaw (right) and Ross Barkley (left) are in serious danger of missing out on World Cup 2018 if they can't get regular first team footballRight-back - Kyle WalkerKyle Walker found himself sat on the bench in Tottenham's run-in last season, with boss Mauricio Pochettino preferring Kieran Trippier at right-back.And the former Burnley man also made it into the England squad for the games against Scotland and France, preferred to Walker in the same role against Les Bleus.With Manchester City sniffing around, the emergence of Trippier, and Walker believed to be keen on a move, it might make sense to exit White Hart Lane (or Wembley, as their new home will be) to secure his England starting spot.Centre-back - Chris SmallingThe Manchester United man could find himself third choice centre-half at the club next season after Victor Lindelof was snapped up from Benfica.And if Phil Jones gets his act together and Marcus Rojo recovers well from injury, Smalling could be even further down the pecking order.Getty Images10 Manchester United team-mates Jesse Lingard and Chris Smalling could find themselves shunted out of the first XI at Old Trafford next seasonThe 27-year-old would be a likely starter for most other Premier League teams, and should he be made available for transfer, there will be many suitors.With the emergence of Ben Gibson (see below), Gary Cahill captaining the national side and John Stones expected to realise his potential sooner rather than later, Smalling may well want to guarantee first-team football away from Old Trafford.Most Read In FootballExclusivegea change Man Utd under pressure to sell David De Gea after star man rejects 'best offer' Live BlogSOL SEARCHING Get the latest updates from Old Trafford as Ole plots summer overhaul Live BlogGUNNER sign?

He has flitted from playing out wide to up front at the Gunners.And now it seems the fans have given up on him making it big. Walcott has looked like he needs a new challenge for a couple of seasons now, and he probably needs to tell Arsene Wenger this if he is to guarantee his spot on the Russia-bound plane.Getty Images10 Theo Walcott and Wayne Rooney will have a battle on to bag a place in Gareth Southgate's England World Cup squadRight-midfield - Jesse LingardThe 24-year-old was in and out of the side last season, and although he is not believed to be on the list of players Jose Mourinho is ready to ship out, slipping further down the pecking order next season could harm his England chances.Lingard only signed a new United contract in April, that put him in line with the club's top earners.But as one of England's hottest prospects, a season getting splinters from the bench is the last thing he needs.A loan move could be more likely than cutting all ties, and it's certainly something Lingard may have to consider if he is to be a sure pick of Southgate.Reuters10 Ross Barkley is at a crossroads at Everton, and is seemingly heading out the exit doorCentre-midfield - Ross BarkleyAfter an inconsistent season once again for Ross Barkley, he was told by boss Ronald Koeman to agree a new deal or face being sold.And with no new deal agreed yet, Barkley's career at Everton looks to be coming to an end.Only days ago SunSport exclusively revealed that Barkley had accepted he needs to leave the Toffees to save his England career.Barkley is behind Davy Klaassen in the pecking in Ronald Koeman’s squad and will not be the Dutchman’s main creative midfielder next season.Injury ruled Barkley out of the Three Lions end-of-season matches against Scotland and France – and he was believed to be gutted at missing out.Barkley’s place in the squad was on a knife-edge before he was crocked after dips in a form and a public row with Koeman over his contract.Getty Images10 Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain started England's last game, a 3-2 friendly defeat to France, and was poorCentre-midfield - Alex Oxlade-ChamberlainLike Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is another Arsenal player who has failed to find his position in Arsene Wenger's starting XI.And it is clearly affecting his game.In England's 3-2 friendly defeat to France, Oxlade-Chamberlain was completely lost in central midfield, dominated by N'Golo Kante, and failing to find a man with his woeful passing.Gone is the youthful exuberance he had when he joined the Gunners from Southampton.Another seaosn of being in and out of the Arsenal team, playing a whole host of different positions will surely end his World Cup 2018 hopes.SunSport has revealed how Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City are all keen to sign him - he needs to make a move to one of them.Getty Images10 Daniel Sturridge looks like he will have to leave Liverpool if he is to prolong his international careerCentre-forward - Daniel SturridgeInjuries have blighted Daniel Sturridge's career - but there's no doubting when he is fit he is one of the most lethal strikers in the Premier League.But what the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo bring is a uninterrupted games for their teams - and that's why Sturridge has failed to put his name in the lights.Kop boss Jurgen Klopp's patience is believed to be running thin now, and he could well be shipped off this summer.It could be the best thing for Sturridge however, after falling behind Roberto Firmino and even Divock Origi in the Liverpool pecking order.Getty Images10 Wayne Rooney was dropped by Gareth Southgate for the England games against Scotland and FranceCentre-forward - Wayne RooneyHis time at Manchester United is petering out, and not in the way he would have wanted.Rooney has been a bit-part player under Jose Mourinho, and has seen him played up front, behind the striker, out side and in central midfield.His dramatic loss of form also say him dropped from the England squad by Gareth Southgate for the games against Scotland and France.It's unclear where he will go next, but if he is told by Mourinho that he is not needed, it would surprise everybody if Rooney is prepared to sit in the background and collect his money.Everton are believed to be interested in an emotive reunion with their former wonderkid, and don't rule out a move to the Chinese Super League or MLS."

Everyone knows that. Manchester is in my heart.I left many good friends there. The supporters are amazing and I wish I can come back one day.Cristiano RonaldoMourinho knows he needs top class attacking players to do just that if he wants to challenge for the Premier League - and that is why he was in so heavily for Antoine Griezmann for much of last season.But who else would be better - and available - than the world player of the year?Getty Images13 Cristiano Ronaldo lifts the Champions League after Manchester United beat Chelsea in MoscowWith pace, power and just a presence to cause panic in opposition teams, Ronaldo is exactly the type of footballer Mourinho wants at his disposal.Money talks - and United have itAny club who wants to sign Cristiano Ronaldo will have to have serious clout financially.Even if he does hold firm in his insistence he wants to leave Spain, Real will demand a huge fee for his signature in the region of £70m-£80m.Then the player himself will command wages similar to the £365,000-a-week he is currently on in the knowledge he is the most marketable footballer on the planet.Getty Images13 Manchester United proved they have financial muscle when they signed Paul PogbaSo only a select group of teams will realistically be able to take Ronaldo, and United are among them.Since Mourinho arrived at Old Trafford it has appeared the Glazers and Ed Woodward are prepared to back him all the way - as their world record signing of Paul Pogba revealed last year.Getty Images13 Jose Mourinho worked with Cristiano Ronaldo when he was in charge of RealThey also forked out £13m in wages for one season of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and were prepared to renew that contract even though he was out injured until Christmas.So the will is there and so is the money. Any wage demands made by the player will not frighten United bosses away.They have a voice in Ronaldo's campSuper-agent Jorge Mendes is a huge influence on Cristiano Ronaldo, his must trusted aide who has guided him through his brilliant career.He is also a major ally of Manchester United.Getty Images13 Jorge Mendes is hugely influential in the career of Cristiano RonaldoGetty Images13 Jorge Mendes and Ronaldo with Sir Alex Ferguson earlier this yearMendes has worked on behalf of the United board in recent years on some of their biggest deals, aside from the fact he is also the agent of Jose Mourinho.So whatever is happening behind the scenes, you can be sure United are fully up to speed and more than aware.Likewise, in Mendes they have a direct route to the player not usually available when it comes to targeting the world's biggest stars.13 Mendes is the agent of Ronaldo and Manchester United manager Jose MourinhoMendes is not just a business ally, to some at United he is a friend and the relationship runs deep.They have the perfect route to convince the player that Old Trafford should be his next destination, and the perfect relationship with the agent to get the deal done.Ronaldo's love affair with ManchesterThough he has flourished during his time in Madrid, there is no escaping the connection Ronaldo feels with the city of Manchester and United in particular.Back in 2014, shortly after a return to the club fell through after extensive talks shortly after David Moyes took charge, the Portuguese winger went on record to reveal his love of the place.PA Wire13 Cristiano Ronaldo has spoken openly about his love for ManchesterHe said: ""I love Manchester. Everyone knows that. Manchester is in my heart.""I left many good friends there. The supporters are amazing and I wish I can come back one day.""Having moved to England as a 17-year-old and shortly after suffered the pain of losing his father, Ronaldo leaned heavily on those at the club for support.Sir Alex Ferguson became so important, Ronaldo has described him as his father figure and their relationship endures to this day.His six years in Manchester turned him into a man able to cope with the adulation and fame that comes with his super-stardom.13 Sir Alex Ferguson greets Ronaldo after Portugal won the European Championship in 2016Getty Images13 Cristiano Ronaldo introduces his son to Sir Alex Ferguson after winning the Champions League in CardiffAnd he has stayed in contact with former team-mates in the seven years since leaving for the Bernabeu, always telling them he would be open to playing for them once again.A sound business decisionLike it or not, football is not just about trophies but also about commercial success, and few clubs are more tuned into that than United.They harnessed the celebrity of David Beckham to help drive their marketing branch on to another level and have continued to grow and evolve as a corporate phenomenon.Getty Images13 David Beckham was a corporate dream for United when he achieved worldwide fameBut with Zlatan Ibrahimovic leaving the club and Wayne Rooney a shadow of his former self, United suddenly find themselves short on global names.Paul Pogba is the only one with a worldwide profile, and United know commercially they need more.There are none bigger than Ronaldo and the prospect of the world's biggest club teaming up with the world's biggest star will be a dream for the marketing maestros.Rex Features13 With Zlatan Ibrahimovic no more, only Paul Pogba remains as a global name at UnitedSuch is his status around the world, United could potentially recoup half of any transfer fee in shirt sales alone.It would also add extra clout to their bargaining power when they are negotiating new sponsorship and merchandising deals.If you think United's profile as a club around the world couldn't get any bigger, you'd be wrong.Signing Ronaldo would ratchet up the interest even further - and the money would come rolling in as a result."

Why should I keep quiet?’ So, I said ‘I’ll buy you a car’ and she replied ‘you’ve got a deal’. We shook on it.“My parents must have thought what a nice brother to buy her a car from my wages at ASDA!”By the time he completed his studies Chris had paid off his student loans and had a total of around £50,000 in the bank and in his playing account.It was time to confess the truth to his dad, Simon, a credit controller from Basildon, Essex and mum, Sonya, who works in the NHS.Chris says: “My dad was impressed and gave me six months to see how much I could make. If I failed I’d have to get a proper job in the real world, which is exactly what I didn’t want to do.8 Chris Moorman with his wife“I moved to Brighton to live with my mates. Basically I didn’t leave the house for six months.“When my pals went out I didn’t because Friday nights are really good because some people play when they’ve had a drink and can tend to make looser calls and bad decisions.“Fortunately, I improved a lot in that time and I did well in tournaments and cash games and I came back and showed my dad the balance and he was astounded.”Chris had made more than £100,000 in six months.But his mum Sonya was not so sure.Chris says: “My dad thought it was the greatest thing ever but my mum was still sceptical.“She’d only seen poker in the movies and was worried someone was going to come and shoot me or something. She thought the people I was taking the money off would get angry.“Also, she’d cut out adverts for jobs she thought I would be interested in taking and include little notes saying things like ‘For when you’ve grown out of this phase’.“Over time she has come to accept it and she’s proud of me.”8 You could play in Las Vegas courtest of 888 PokerChris kept on winning tournaments. He collected $1,000,000 dollars at a tournament in Los Angeles in 2014.And when he won a million euros in Cannes he was given his winnings in CASH.There’s that smile again as he remembers: “I was walking around with a million euros in a back pack. All in purple 500 Euro notes. I must have looked like a drug dealer!”The next tournament was a 45-minute cab ride away in San Remo in Italy where Chris stashed the cash in the safe in his hotel room.He says: “Later, at the tournament a guy gave me 200,000 euros he owed me in a brown paper bag! It’s a crazy life.”Chris met his American wife, Katie, at a poker tournament in Las Vegas where the couple have a base when not travelling the globe playing poker – but amazingly they don’t own a house.Next month, Chris will be in Vegas to compete in the World Series of Poker tournament where our lucky Sun reader will also be competing for the first prize of $10million.He says: “I’ve played the World Series 11 times and never won it.Most read in sportExclusivegea change Man Utd under pressure to sell David De Gea after star man rejects 'best offer' MAMMA MIA Pornhub legend Khalifa shares footage from surgery after being hit by hockey puck Live BlogSOL SEARCHING Get the latest updates from Old Trafford as Ole plots summer overhaul Live BlogGUNNER sign?

This is the most out-there song on the album. I wanted to try something different.“When it started coming together I started getting a bit freaked out and began telling the producer to start toning things back a bit so it doesn’t sound as funky.“But then I grew into it and I really liked it.”His debut album – out later this year – will also feature more singer-songwriter tracks like first release This Town.Niall says: “It’s a balance. I knew if I was to make an album what it would be.“If you listen to the ONE DIRECTION stuff, I can hear each of our individual tastes in some of the songs.“I just know when I pick up a guitar what I naturally do.”And no subject is off limits as he discusses whether 1D could re-form as a trio or with ZAYN MALIK, as well as LIAM PAYNE’s romance with CHERYL.He also talks of his friendship with JAMES CORDEN and why he’s decided to stay single after “dabbling” with different women.The in-depth chat comes as Niall prepares to release solo single Slow Hands, which bosses at Capitol Records hope will propel him into being one of the world’s biggest pop stars.Dan Jones9 The Irish star talked to Bizarre's Dan Wootton about his solo career, his love life, and a 1D reunionRex Features9 He revealed he left Simon Cowell's record label Syco because he needed a 'fresh start'Joining Capitol meant Niall — the only member of the group to have stayed with their management company Modest — had to walk away from his X Factor mentor Simon.Simon’s record company Syco had been desperate to sign him.Niall admits it was a tough call and I ask if Simon hates him now. He says: “I hope not, please don’t hate me.“We were very close to Simon for years and had a lot of success together.“I just felt like I wanted and needed a fresh start.“It’s a long time to be at a label I wanted to broaden my horizons and try something new.“We both know that and when One Direction come back we’ll still have albums left to do.”Getty Images - FilmMagic9 He insisted 1D will reunite one day to make more records with SimonMOST READ IN TV & SHOWBIZExclusiveDAVINA'S HAIR-O Davina McCall, 51, finds love again with her long-term pal and hairdresser BOYS DON'T CRY Holly Willoughby clashes with Ant Middleton in tense parenting debate THRONE IT OUT THERE Game of Thrones 'told fans who'd win the crown in FIRST ever episode' ExclusiveKatie Sliced Katie Price reveals shocking lipo and bumlift scars after surgery in Turkey KATIE'S PAIN Katie Piper in hospital with 'bad infection' as she admits ignoring symptoms No woman was safe Real Gentleman Jack bedded 100s of women & noted romps in sex code diary While many in the industry have speculated the various solo careers could spell the end of 1D, Niall remains resolute they will be back.He tells me: “It’s been a year and a bit already. We don’t want to put a time on it. But when that phone call does come, no matter whoever it comes from, we’re back again.“At the minute it’s exactly where it was six months ago — we’re doing our own thing.“You know I’m going to probably end up touring this, Harry will probably end up doing the same, probably Liam probably Louis, that’s a year – time adds up.”Dan Jones9 The heart-throb says his love life is non-existent, but added: 'If it happens, it happens'Dan Jones9 He chatted with Dan for the first episode of his new weekly podcast Bizarre Life with Dan WoottonCould 1D reunite without one of its current four members, becoming a trio? Niall says: “I don’t know. I’m guessing so. That’s not a conversation we’ve had.”Could One Direction reunite with Zayn, who quit the group before the hiatus? He says: “Again, a conversation we haven’t had and I’m sure the fans would love it and it would be great but again I don’t know.”During his seven years in 1D Niall was the glue that held the band together.Imagine being on Tinder, there’d be uproar! I don’t think the online dating thing is for meAs the journalist with the most access to the band, it was obvious to me he enjoyed every minute and was close with all his bandmates.But he admits the break “came at the right time”.Speaking for the first time about the reasons behind the split, he says: “It was a long time to keep going at that intensity and that pressure, touring that much and bringing out albums at that pace.“We felt like we just wanted to either chill or do your own thing.“When we called it, it was kind of a release in a way so you could go and see family, see friends, go backpacking.”Niall bits— JAMES CORDEN was like a “big brother” to 1D.Niall recalls: “He was unbelievable,  always there giving advice. If there was anything going wrong he would be the first on the phone making sure everyone was all right.”— NIALL still hangs out with his old pal JUSTIN BIEBER.He said: “I play golf with him. He lives down the road from me in LA. He’d probably say he’s better but he’s wrong. He’s a great guy and in a good place. I’m happy for him.”The lads have only been together once as a band since their break, in an emotion-charged meeting backstage at The X Factor in December just days after the death of LOUIS TOMLINSON’s mum.Louis performed his debut solo single Just Hold On for the first time during the show’s final.Niall recalls: “First, that’s a tough song to sing, being out there on your own for the first time on a week where something like that happens must have been horrific for him. But it was a no-brainer we were all in.“I was in New York and I heard about it and there was no doubt that was the next thing I was doing.“So we all flew home and we didn’t want it to be like the whole publicity thing. We didn’t want that we were in and out to see Louis and be there to support him.”While they may not meet face to face, Niall says the band communicates “all the time” using “big email chains”.He explains: “Everyone’s trying to listen to each others’ stuff. Louis lives quite near me in LA so I’ll be going round to him when I go out there, playing him some of my stuff.“Hopefully he’s got some stuff to play and same with Harry.”Surprisingly, he denies being shocked when I revealed news of Liam’s relationship with former X Factor judge Cheryl.He says: “I was happy for him. She’s one of the most beautiful women in the country so he did well there as far as I’m concerned.“She’s a lovely girl, he’s a lovely guy and now they’ve got a baby and it’s great.”Splash News9 Niall said it would be 'great' if Zayn Malik rejoined the bandNiall on...

I’m 23, I should be out dating and out with mates and enjoying the job that I do.”But somewhat remarkably Niall — who says he “dated and dabbled” during his time in the group — reveals his love life is now non-existent.He says: “I’ve been flat-out busy and kind of went through a stage of not caring about it for a while and I’m going to be busy now for the summer again.“So I don’t really know where I’m going to fit that part in. But if it happens, it happens. I’ve got many years ahead for that.”Rex Features9 Niall says Liam Payne's girlfriend Cheryl is 'one of the most beautiful women in the country so he did well there'Most BizarreNiall tells me his oddest moments . . .MOST BIZARRE ACCIDENT: “Croke Park Dublin. Sound check. Raining. Went to see how wet the stage was and slipped and bounced my elbow off the floor. And my guitar fell off the stage and it was quite an expensive one.”MOST BIZARRE PARTY: “At the Grammys this year I was texting DIPLO saying, ‘Is there anything going on tonight?’ I didn’t go. I just stayed at home watching it on TV and kind of got excited by it. So I just got on my clobber and went out. I got there and there were two or three thousand people in the house. Crazy. JUSTIN BIEBER made an appearance, MARK RONSON – it was a who’s who.”MOST BIZARRE DREAM: “I was being chased by BRYAN CRANSTON in Breaking Bad form. Me and my mates had a weekend on the booze and we were being chased around some field by him. and he was throwing meth at us and we were jumping away from him.”Niall says it is “feasible” to date despite his star status, with most of his romances coming from being set up by mutual friends.He’s never been tempted to join a dating app either, telling me: “Imagine being on Tinder, there’d be uproar! I don’t think the online dating thing is for me.“It’s not really my thing. It’s not very practical but I’m more of a bumping into someone in a bar or someone introducing me to someone.“I’m also quite shy, you’d be surprised. I’m not very good at talking to them.”Despite his nerves around girls, it’s clear to me how Niall has blossomed into a young man during his time living a real life outside of the 1D bubble.He says: “It’s strange for me being here with you on my own as well but it’s good, I’m happy.”How Lads' hol helped pain9 Niall took an Inbetweeners-style backpacking holiday with two cousins after 1D splitAN Inbetweeners-style backpacking holiday let Niall get over 1D going on an indefinite break.He and two cousins travelled through Bali, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.Niall says: “That was my best decision. I got away from it all and didn’t spend time moping about it.”Despite being a multi-millionaire pop star, there were no private jets or five-star hotels he was used to.When Niall arrived on a small island in the Philippines, he had nowhere to stay.He recalls: “It was Chinese New Year with two rooms left on the whole island. It was like the Inbetweeners Movie, when they turn up and there’s cats running up the street, damp towels and spiders the size of my hand climbing the wall. I wouldn’t change it for the world.”However, Niall didn’t use his time off to go wild, saying: “I enjoy having a few beers but I don’t go crazy.”Bizmeter: Digital DetoxIf Niall could only keep one, what would it be?SNAPCHAT: Ariana Grande.""I just find her profile so cool.""INSTAGRAM: Ricky Gervais.TWITTER: James Blunt.GADGET: iPad.PLAYLIST: Spotify.APP: Waze.TV CHANNEL: Golf channel."

But a problem nevertheless.""Cricket has many quirky and whimsical terms, the origins of which even many tragics of the game would struggle to explain.Reuters5 Kuldeep Yadav is one of very few left-arm wrist-spin bowlers of the modern era""Fielding positions like silly mid-off, third man, fine leg and cow corner (in an unofficial capacity) are but a few.""They are part of the rich fabric of the sport, and may they live on for as long as cricket is played.

And the rip-off is quite shocking.Financier Andrew Brettell was looking round for cover for his house in Clapham, South West London, and Tesco came up with a very fair £166.40. As he was 52 (you have to be 50-plus to use their site) he went on Age UK and they came back with . . . wait for it . . . £1,154.74, a staggering seven times the Tesco price.And their explanation was simply bulls**t.To discover why their price was 600 per cent higher, Mr Brettell contacted Doug Strachan, managing director of the charity’s commercial arm.12 The disgraced charity is at it againHe explained the increase by saying:You have a high-value property — that wasn’t a problem for Tesco. Clearly cobblers.You have lots of flat roofs — that wasn’t a problem for Tesco. Complete cobblers.Clapham is a high-risk crime area — so is the whole of London. That wasn’t a problem for Tesco. Even more cobblers.And finally, your YOUNG age — 52? What on earth has that got to do with his home insurance and why didn’t it affect Tesco? Absolute cobblers.The charity is simply making this stuff up on the hoof. How much of the excessive profit of almost £1,000 over the Tesco price is split between them and their insurance provider Ageas?Getty Images12 I would suggest telling anyone you know to get the hell out of any scheme they offerIf you or your parents are covered by Age UK, get the hell out of it.

Huffman was simply investigating the receptors in the human brain that responded to ­tetrahydrocannabinol, the key ­ingredient in cannabis.He made synthetic compounds and wrote detailed research papers to ensure he received further grants for his work. Huffman named each one with his own initials JWH.www.kobal-collection.com10 The scene could be straight out of Shaun of the Dead but it's actually drug-inducedHe claims he was “experimenting for good” but now recognises the deadly danger of Spice and wants it banned globally — but wrongly, in my view, believes cannabis should be legal.Spice was made illegal in the UK last year but there have only been 72 prosecutions with 332 shops banned from selling it and 31 shops closed down.It has not halted the trade, with the Sunday Times finding more than 40 websites offering ­different forms of the drug including one prepared to sell £80,000-worth without a check.Asked if he had tried the drug, Huffman replied: “Lord, no.”MOST READ IN NEWSDYING WISH Single mum loses fight with cancer after asking family 'Look after my boys' ExclusiveROO'S FURY Wayne Rooney livid after bro filmed looking pally in pub loo with Tommy Robinson ZAPPED TO DEATH Toddler killed after putting phone charger in mouth while plugged into wall 'RAPE' RAP Oritse Williams' manager admits touching 'zombified' girl as 'star raped her' WarningMOB JUSTICE Furious crowds strip female ‘shoplifters’ naked, batter them and cut their hair COT CLOTS Celebs' pics of babies sleeping in unsafe conditions 'fuelling cot death rise' Spice is rampant in our jails and, with the ease with which it can now be manufactured, is likely to create more addicts on our streets.I know our politicians are taking this threat seriously but there are always siren voices explaining why the liberal view is best.To those people can I suggest they look at the photo of the young man in Manchester and ask: Would you like one of your children reduced to a zombie?I think I know the answer already.

Like you, I have been told council tax bills MUST rise next month to deal with the cost of social care for the elderly.Fair enough.What nobody told me was that councillors round my way (and possibly round yours) were going to take advantage of the hike to award themselves 12.4 per cent pay rises from May while pegging council staff to just two per cent.What made it even more outrageous was my council Elmbridge – it covers snooty Weybridge, Esher and Walton on Thames in Surrey – is controlled by residents’ associations and Lib Dims.They sell themselves as representatives of ordinary people, not fat cats exploiting their position.Clearly that script will have to be rewritten.Alamy10 But it's frustrating to see my local councillors give themselves a pay rise out of the moneyTo give them credit, the Conservative opposition were horrified and voted against the rise of £547 to £4,942. And so much for pretending to worry about the old dears in the area as the councillors have raised the price of day centre meals by six per cent.Having stood twice as an independent – and been rejected twice – I know some of the characters with their noses in the trough and have even contributed heavily to the election expenses of a couple of them.

But this year the forecast is a £4million loss, with that figure doubling to £8million in 2018 because advertising in print is forecast to continue its downward spiral.With no cover price – the Standard is free – the slightest of movements in advertising has a horrendous effect on the annual profit and loss statement. And that’s where Osbo comes in.It’s not his skill in journalism (he hasn’t any) nor having mates at the top table (he no longer has any) that made him a shoo-in for the job, but the fact that as Chancellor he was used to looking at mammoth losses all day long – and blaming somebody else for them.A perfect CV for being editor of the Standard.As with his old job it will, I confidently predict, end in tears. Night Nightly ShowRex Features10 The Nightly Show's poor performance is bringing down ITV's day viewing figures tooGET ready to say night night to ITV’s p**s-poor Nightly Show.It hit rock bottom with Davina McCall bringing in just 990,000 ­saddos but had one other strange effect – it reduced the ­audience of the network’s breakfast show Good Morning Britain some nine hours later.An insider tells me that with viewers seeking news at 10pm and ITV giving them tosh, instead they’re switching to the BBC and then ­toddle off to bed leaving the set tuned to the Beeb.So in the morning the ­audience can’t be bothered to switch over, stay with the BBC and damage ITV’s daytime figures.Genius, pure genius. The Effing Sandwich Shop10 This punny sandwich shop made me chuckleCAFE in Effingham Road, Sheffield – Effing Sandwich Shop.Plumber’s van in Spain – Tubbs, Boggs And Boyler.Window cleaners in­ ­Haywards Heath, West Sussex – A Glass Act.Sports massage firm in Wigan – Knot A Problem.On the back of a safari bus in South Africa – Dung Beetles Really Know Their S**t.Fish merchants in Farnborough, Hants – Offish Supplies.Plumbing firm in Chingford, Essex – The Great Drain Robbers.Carpenters in Brighton, East Sussex – Wooden It Be Nice.Chinese in Romford, Essex – Ho Lee Fook.Another Chinese in Burnage, Manchester – Wok And Roll.Hairdressers in Wigan – Style Council.Love the punnies.

Exclusive'Truly amazing' New 'miracle' eye cream claims to roll back the clock - but does it really work? “I heard a couple of pops and I heard my mom scream,” Jennifer revealed in her interview with detectives in their hometown of Markham in Ontario, Canada.“Then I heard a couple more pops.”This was one of the only truths Jennifer told investigators in the aftermath of the attack, which left her father fighting for his life in Markham Stouffville Hospital.In the space of just 14 days, Jennifer would go from innocent victim to chief suspect.She insisted to police that she waited for the men to leave before calling 911.Meanwhile, her father had survived the shooting, crawled up the basement stairs and stumbled out of the front door streaming blood and screaming. He was rushed to hospital for surgery and put in a medically induced coma.“Jennifer was initially interviewed as a victim and witness,” explains Detective Bill Courtice, the lead investigator on the case.Court Exhibits14 Jennifer was initially treated as a victim and witness, but holes in her story began to appear“We took what she told us at face value. However, as information was gleaned from peripheral interviews, we were left with unanswered questions.”Mainly, how had Jennifer made that emergency call with her hands bound behind her back – which is how she’d been found when officers first entered the home.Suspicions were further aroused when Hann was brought out of his coma three days later.“He immediately described how Jennifer appeared to have a ‘friendly’ conversation with one of the men who attacked them,” explains Detective Courtice.Court Exhibits14 The crime scene: Jennifer told police intruders had forced her parents down into the basement after tying her to the banister with a shoelaceBy the time Jennifer attended her mother’s funeral with Felix, she was already under surveillance as a “person of interest” and detectives were quickly discovering that lying came easy to her.In fact, she’d been deceiving her parents for years, ever since her high-school grades began to slip below the straight As expected by her father.To avoid disappointing them, Jennifer simply told them what they wanted to hear – that she was on course to graduate from high school with honours – and backed it up with forged report cards.In contrast, her brother excelled, going on to be an engineer.Court Exhibits14 When Jennifer's grades started to slip she constructed an elaborate web of lies to avoid disappointing her parents“There was a huge weight of expectation on her as the child of Chinese-Vietnamese immigrants,” explains Jeremy Grimaldi, author of A Daughter’s Deadly Deception, a bestselling book detailing the case.“Hann was a factory worker and hoped Jennifer could be their gateway to joining the middle classes and living the American dream, if she got a good job with a good salary.”Unfortunately, Jennifer didn’t share the dream.A gifted pianist, she longed to teach music.She deceived her parents for years, saying what they wanted to hear.Jeremy Grimaldi Author of A Daughter's Deadly Deception“But her father wanted her to be a pharmacist, which she reluctantly took on as her own goal,” says Jeremy.When Jennifer left high school in 2003, she told her family she’d been accepted at Ryerson University in downtown Toronto to study two years of science then transfer over to the University of Toronto’s pharmacology course.Hann was so impressed, he bought his daughter a new laptop to help with her studies.What he didn’t know was that her high-school graduation was a lie.Court Exhibits14 Police began to realise that Jennifer was an expert liar and had even managed to forge report cards to keep up her charade with her parentsIn reality, Jennifer’s offer from Ryerson had been withdrawn because she’d failed a class.To keep up the charade, she pretended to attend Freshers Week.When her father mentioned tuition fees, she told him that she’d been granted a £2,400 scholarship, producing a fake document that proclaimed she would receive a student assistance loan.Every day, Jennifer would leave for “university” and head to a library, where she’d study science textbooks in the vain hope of somehow schooling herself in pharmacology.Court Exhibits14 Jennifer kept her long-term boyfriend Daniel Wong, a small-time marijuana dealer, secret from her parents because they didn't approveWhen she didn’t have her head in a book, Jennifer would secretly see long-term boyfriend Daniel Wong, now 30, a small-time marijuana dealer she’d been dating since they were both 16.“Her parents had met Daniel, but didn’t like him, partly because he wasn’t pure Chinese,” reveals Jeremy.“They also felt Jennifer shouldn’t have a boyfriend before the end of university.”Incredibly, Jennifer kept up the lies about her education for four years.Court Exhibits14 When Jennifer's web of lies unravelled, she recruited hitman Lenford Crawford (AKA Homeboy) through her boyfriend DanielWhen it came to graduation, she told her parents the course had been over-enrolled so students were restricted to one invite each.Jennifer said she didn’t want to choose between them, so they agreed she should invite her best friend Topaz instead.This was the same friend Jennifer had supposedly been staying overnight with three times a week throughout her course to cut down on her commute and ensure she never missed a class.Topaz did exist, but Jennifer never stayed with her – it was a ruse to be able to spend more time with Daniel.However, one day in May 2009, Hann called Topaz and asked to speak to his daughter.She figured she’d never be allowed to do what she wished as long as they were still alive.Jeremy GrimaldiAuthor of A Daughter's Deadly DeceptionWhen she told him Jennifer wasn’t there, he got suspicious and questioned her further, eventually demanding she tell him what was going on.Topaz had no option but to admit Jennifer hadn’t stayed that night – or any other.Suddenly Jennifer’s fictitious life crumbled.When she returned home the next morning, Hann began to systematically expose her lies, beginning with Topaz’s confession and ending with the fact that he’d found out that the blood-testing lab Jennifer had told him she’d been volunteering at to enhance her job prospects had no record of her ever working there.Perhaps relieved that her exhausting web of lies was finally exposed, Jennifer confessed – she wasn’t their golden child with the impossibly bright future, but the opposite: a high-school dropout.Court Exhibits14 Through Homeboy, Jennifer recruited extra muscle David Mylvaganam (left) and Eric Carty (right)Hann ruled that she would never see Daniel again, took away her mobile phone and began tracking how many miles she was driving so he’d know if she was sneaking off to see her boyfriend.In a Facebook post in February 2009, Jennifer wrote that from that moment on it was “like living under house arrest”.Her parents mapped out a new life plan for her, which involved becoming a pharmacy lab technician or nurse.It’s at this point Jennifer’s attitude towards them took on a darker intent.Court Exhibits14 Discrepancies in Jennifer's story meant she soon became the investigation's chief suspect“When she accepted her father’s ultimatum to stay home and never see Daniel again, she made up her mind that something needed to be done about her parents,” says Jeremy.“She figured she’d never be allowed to do what she wished as long as they were still alive.”Jennifer knew Daniel had an acquaintance through his drug dealing called Lenford Crawford, AKA Homeboy, who had plenty of criminal contacts.“It was Daniel who reached out to Homeboy after being pestered by Jennifer with 99 texts and phone calls over the course of just one day,” reveals Detective Courtice.Jeremy Grimaldi14 Author Jeremy Grimaldi wrote a book about the case“The next contact is directly from Homeboy to Jennifer in her phone records.”And those phone logs would prove pivotal in confirming Jennifer’s guilt.“The phone records were absolutely crucial to solving this case,” explains Detective Courtice.“Our investigation was a four-year ordeal, where officers were forced to go through 700,000 lines of texts and phone calls to get to the evidence.”One of those texts, dated November 8, 2010, was from Homeboy, then 28, and read: “After work OK will be game time.”The phone records were absolutely crucial to solving this case.Detective Courticelead investigatorIt had been agreed that the double assassination would cost Jennifer £8,000 but that wouldn’t be a problem as, if everything went to plan, she’d receive half of her parents’ estate.But everything didn’t go to plan and two weeks later, on November 22, the police brought Jennifer in to be questioned for the third and final time. By now, detectives were convinced of her guilt.“Prior to the homicide and leading right up to the men entering, Jennifer was on two phones at the same time,” says Detective Courtice.“She spoke to friends on a Samsung, while texting and talking on an iPhone that was used exclusively for talking to Homeboy and his associates. This raised more suspicions as to why she didn’t call the police or ask her friends to when the intruders entered the Pan residence.”After a three-hour grilling, the recorded interview captured the moment when Jennifer could take no more.“You’re involved in this. I know that,” said the interviewing detective.“There’s no question about it. The only question right now is: Are you going to keep making mistakes?”After hesitating, Jennifer replied: “But what happens to me?”Arrested on the spot and charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder, Jennifer finally went on trial on March 19, 2014, along with Daniel and Homeboy, as well as hired muscle David Mylvaganam, 34, and Eric Carty, 25.Court Exhibits14 Jennifer finally crumbled in the interrogation, asking ""what happens to me?""During proceedings, Felix told jurors he’d been oblivious to his beloved sister’s deception, but admitted their father was very strict.“Dad was old-school,” he said.“He was very controlling. It was the just the way my dad is… it’s sort of like tough love.”When it was Jennifer’s turn to take to the stand, she tried to convince the jury she’d been suicidal but too scared to kill herself, so hired Homeboy to arrange for someone to kill her at home.Court Exhibits14 Jennifer's brother Felix said in court he was oblivious to her deceptionThen, she insisted in court, at the last minute she had wanted to call the whole thing off, but only succeeded in angering the would-be killers,who turned their attentions on her parents.The jury didn’t buy it. At the end of a gruelling nine-month trial, in which more than 50 witnesses testified and over 200 exhibits were filed, Jennifer was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years.The four men are also serving life sentences.Her father wasn’t in court to hear his daughter's sentencing, but wrote an impact statement that was read out to the jury: “When I lost my wife, I lost my daughter at the same time. I don’t feel like I have a family any more.”Court Exhibits14 Jennifer Pan was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison - she can't contact her family until she gets out in her mid-50sFelix had moved away to the East Coast.Three years on, Jennifer maintains her innocence and is appealing.“She wants desperately to speak to her family,” reveals Jeremy.“But they were granted a non-communication order, so she won’t be able to contact them until she gets out in her mid-50s. Jennifer may never have pulled a trigger, but her lies proved just as deadly.”If you were shocked by this story, you might be interested to read about the woman who posed as a CIA agent to trick her parents into killing her friends.A Daughter’s Deadly Deception by Jeremy Grimaldi (£13.99, Dundurn) is out now."

I’d always been overweight and assumed that was always going to be me.“But it was only when my body wouldn’t fit into the plane seat that I realised just how big I’d become.“Now I’ve lost the weight, I feel amazing — and when I go on holiday I can’t wait to show off my new body.”Rachel, who is 5ft 5in tall, had piled on weight due to years of scoffing crisps and chocolate in front of the telly.13 When Rachel met husband Gus, the pair would spend nights in with takeaways and enjoy big meals outBy the time she was 18 years old, she was a size 24 and weighed 18st. She now recalls: “I wasn’t happy but I just thought I was the size I was meant to be.“I liked sitting watching TV on the sofa while eating all my favourite foods — especially crisps and chocolate.”On a regular day Rachel ate four pieces of toast for breakfast then had a mid-morning snack of crisps and chocolate.Lunch would be a white-bread sandwich plus more crisps, while she would finish off the day with a takeaway Chinese dinner.13 When they married in 2012, Rachel was 22 stoneWhen Rachel was 22 she met her future husband Gus, now 32.

The exercise was so hard, so I decided to set myself little goals each month.”With her morning swims and workout classes, Rachel noticed an immediate change to her figure.She says: “Seeing the results motivated me more. I realised I didn’t need to be ‘Fat Rach’ any more.“The Body Pump classes taught me how to get my body moving and working all the muscles I’d neglected. I learnt how to squat and lunge — words I’d never heard of before.”By last October, Rachel had lost more than half of her body weight, dropping 15st to a size ten.She says: “With every stone I lost, I felt more and more amazing. When I reached ten stone, I couldn’t believe how much I’d achieved in one year.“I no longer fit into my old clothes and had to get a whole new wardrobe.“People don’t recognise me and my husband is so proud of me.”To celebrate, she and Gus booked a holiday to Benidorm.Rachel says: “This time I didn’t feel nervous boarding the flight. I slipped into the seat comfortably and nobody blinked an eye.“I felt so emotional that I cried, this time with happiness.“My holiday was filled with sun, sunbathing, cocktails and confidence.“It has been an amazing year and apart from tucking into a Christmas dinner, I’ve completely stuck to my plan.“I don’t spend hours in front of the TV and barely recognise the woman I once was.“I was overweight, hated the sight of my body and felt awful.“I finally love looking at the lady in the mirror and have more energy than I’ve ever had in my life.” Shape up with this winning work outRACHEL attended Body Pump classes, where she was put through her paces in this full-body workout.News Group Newspapers Ltd13Squat: START by standing with  straight back and legs wide apart.Then squat, keeping your back straight, chest up and feet flat.Once as low as possible, return to start, squeezing your bottom as you come up.News Group Newspapers Ltd13Push-up: GET into a plank position with your hands under and just wider than your shoulders.Slowly lower halfway to the ground until your chest nearly touches the floor, then push back up to the top.News Group Newspapers Ltd13Lunge: STEP forward to a lunge position and bend both knees to 90 degrees.Keep your knee in line with your ankle and make sure your knees don’t roll in or out.Return back to the start position, then lunge forward with the opposite leg.News Group Newspapers Ltd13Toe-touch: WITH legs wide apart, reach left hand to right foot and swing right hand behind you.Then swap sides to reach right hand to left foot.

Sometimes I just wish I was normal,” admits Ferne, 26.“I’m a true romantic. I just want to find love.”Thanks to the follow-up series of Celebs Go Dating, Ferne – along with Hollyoaks actress Jorgie Porter, Celebrity Big Brother’s Stephen Bear, Diversity’s Perri Kiely, Kim Kardashian’s ‘best friend’ Jonathan Cheban, Pussycat Doll Melody Thornton and, trying his luck for the second time, reality star Joey Essex – will be moulded by relationship gurus Eden Blackman and Nadia Essex into perfect dating material.That’s the idea, at least.The celebrities are sent to ‘mixers’ to meet potential dates, as well as on a string of one-to-one encounters, and are scrutinised on their performance and told where they’re going wrong in the game of love, so as to improve their future chances.It’s something Ferne feels she’s benefitted from immensely.“I’ve learnt to calm it down,” she says.“If I fancy someone, my God, are they gonna know about it. And if I don’t fancy someone I’m quite dismissive. When I started this process, I was like: ‘I want this, this and this.’ But actually I keep picking those guys and it hasn’t worked.”That’s not to say Ferne is open to going with the flow – she still has a very long list of attributes she looks for in a man.“I want someone who’s effortlessly cool, who doesn’t try too hard and is charismatic. I would describe myself as a wild bird; I can’t have my wings clipped but I need someone who will put me in my place,” she grins.“I want someone I can eat Chinese with on a Friday night and not worry if I’m dripping sweet-and-sour sauce down the front of my top.""I want someone who’s going to throw me on the bed and also stroke my hair. Looks-wise, I want a blend of Ryan Gosling, Zac Efron and Jack O’Connell.”Getty3 Single Joey Essex will also take part in the showFamous for her straight-talking, no-nonsense attitude, Ferne is a big believer in laying her cards on the table at the first opportunity.“I’m so ready to settle down,” she confides. “If I had the right guy, I’d have a baby tomorrow. I want a big family.""I have no qualms about bringing it up on a first date. I don’t understand it when people say: ‘It’s going to scare a man off.’ Why?!”With fellow TOWIE star Joey also looking for a potential partner on the show, couldn’t they just cut out the middle man?Getty3 Jorgie Porter is hoping to meet the man of her dreams on the show“I don’t look at him in that way. Whatsoever!” insists the presenter.Although Ferne’s keen not to give too much away about the men she’s dated on the show, she does give us a taste of what to expect.“I’ve been out with some real characters,” she says.“Some said things you wouldn’t believe. One guy told me I had massive legs! And then I travelled to Manchester for a date and it was the maddest, most disastrous date I’ve been on. He tried to suck my neck. It’s comedy gold!”NEW!

They are so precious. We’ve got our dream'She added: ""I had imagined waiting years to find a surrogate so I feel like Claire was sent to us, and having the twins is beyond what I ever imagined.""I had got to the point where I was thinking, ‘This is never going to happen for us.’""We both find ourselves just staring at them. We can’t quite believe that they are ours. They are so precious. We’ve got our dream.""Nicola realised she may never have children in 2006 after doctors removed a cyst from her ovaries and discovered she had endometriosis.The condition, where pieces of the womb lining are found outside the womb, left her suffering agonising period pains and internal scarring.Doctors also warned Nicola that she may be infertile - but told her she was 'young' with 'plenty of time', so to 'go away and try' naturally anyway.After spending months drinking Chinese tea, taking vitamins and cutting sugar, wheat and dairy out of her diet, Nicola started looking into IVF in 2009.The couple went private because they weren't eligible for a free cycle on the NHS - because Matt was a smoker who was struggling to quit.They forked out £22,500 for three rounds of IVF at the Lister Fertility Clinic in Chelsea, London, in 2009, 11 and 13, but not one of them worked.After four invasive surgeries, they resigned themselves to the fact that Nicola wouldn't be able to carry a child and started researching surrogacy.But with their savings exhausted and no options available on the NHS, Nicola, Matt and their families resorted to fundraising.They set up The Ede Family Surrogacy and IVF Fund in May 2015 and donations of cash and children's clothes and toys for them to sell in nearly-new sales flooded in.It's illegal to advertise for a surrogate in the UK, so Nicola and Matt thought they would be looking for years - but, three months later, Claire messaged them.SWNS10 Baby Felix weighed 6lbs3SWNS10 While his sister Savannah weighed 5lb11The first-time surrogate, who had carried twins before and lived just six miles away, agreed to have two embryos implanted.The trio then planned every detail of the pregnancy and had counselling, and three months after meeting the embryos were implanted at Epsom New Life Clinic, Surrey.At six weeks, they discovered both embryos had survived so they were having twins and, at 16 weeks, they learned they were expecting a boy and a girl.On October 27, a month early, the twins were born via C-section - with Felix appearing at 11.36am weighing 6lbs3, and Savannah a minute later weighing 5lbs11.Throughout the operation, Nicola and Matt held Claire's hands - and the moment the babies were born they were handed over.Nicola said: ""It was incredible. It didn’t feel real. My husband was sobbing like a blubbering mess and I was just in shock. The next day I couldn’t stop crying.""Claire stayed in for a few days and then went home. We have bonded so much.“She said so many people have asked, ‘How can you give away your baby?’, but she says, ‘They are not mine.’“From day one she knew they weren’t hers, she was looking after them and they are biologically ours. She was just so happy to see us so happy.""Former Sainsbury's worker Claire, who has a 10-year-old son and four-year-old twin boys, couldn't stop thinking about the couple after reading their story.The married 32-year-old said: ""I eventually had to reach out to them and make it known that I would be willing to help them.""It is a lot of responsibility and pressure to carry someone else's children - it has the same hormones, worries and emotions as every other pregnancy plus more on top.""But I am so proud of what we all did. I was able to be there when they saw their babies for the very first time. That moment was what it was all for."""

Rather than a single, large main rotor, they have multiple small rotors.AP:Associated Press6 An artist's illustrationg of Vahana, a flying car project from AirbusEach rotor is operated by a battery-powered electric motor instead of a conventional aircraft piston engine.It's no sure bet that flying-car dreams will turn into reality.There are many obstacles, including convincing regulators that the aircraft are safe, figuring out how to handle thousands of new low-flying aircraft over cities without collisions and developing batteries that will keep them aloft long enough to be useful.But entrepreneurs are moving forward. They see a vast potential market for ""air taxis"" and personally owned small aircraft to transport people from the fringes of metropolitan areas to city centres as urban areas grow more congested and people spend more time stuck in traffic.They envision tens of thousands of one or two-person flying taxis delivering passengers to the rooftops of office buildings in city centres and other landing pads during rush hours.AP:Associated Press6 This image from Urban Aeronautics/Tactical Robotics shows an Israeli-made flying car""In as little as 10 years, products could be on the market that revolutionize urban travel for millions of people,"" said Zach Lovering, the leader of Airbus' project to develop an autonomous flying taxi called the Vahana. The name means the mount or vehicle of a Hindu deity.Uber released a 98-page report in October making the business case for air taxis, which the company sees as the future of on-demand transportation.Uber doesn't have any plans to develop a flying car itself, but the online transportation network is advising several companies that have aircraft in the works.""The role we want to play is as a catalyst for the entire industry,"" said Nikhil Goel, an Uber project manager for advanced programs.AP:Associated Press6 Another view of Vahana, a flying car from AirbusSome of the aircraft are drones that will be preprogrammed for each flight and monitored or operated from the ground or a command center. Others are designed for human pilots.It's unclear yet how much the aircraft will cost, although prices are likely to vary significantly. Some of the aircraft are designed to be individually owned, while others are envisioned more for commercial use.Designers hope that if demand is high, prices can be kept affordable through economies of mass production.Several recent developments could make these aircraft possible. Advances in computing power mean the rotors on multi-copter drones can be adjusted many times per second, making the aircraft easy to control.PR Company6 The AeroMobil 3.0 'flying roadster' pictured during its test flight in SlovakiaDrones have also benefited from advances in battery and electric motor technology. Some companies, like Chinese dronemaker EHang, are scaling-up drones so that they can carry people.Another aircraft under development, Santa Cruz, California-based Joby Aviation's S2, looks more like a conventional plane except that there are 12 tiltrotors spread along the wings and tail.And some, like the Vahana, a cockpit mounted on a sled and flanked by propellers in front and back, don't really look like any aircraft in the skies today.""In terms of what you can make fly in a reliable manner, the solution speed gateway that (computer) chips have gone through recently have literally opened the door to a whole new world of flying machine possibilities,"" said Charles Eastlake, an Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University professor emeritus of aerospace engineering.AP:Associated Press6 An artist's illustration of the Joby S2 Electric VTOL PAV aircraft by Joby AviationBut he also cautioned: ""My best engineering guess is that people actually using autonomous air taxis in the next 10 or 15 years is possible, but definitely not certain. The challenges are big.""Key for many of the designs will be the development of longer-lasting lightweight batteries.Currently available batteries could probably keep an air taxi aloft about 15 to 30 minutes before it would have to land, experts said.Depending on how fast the aircraft flies, that probably isn't quite enough to transport passengers between nearby cities or across metropolitan areas, experts said.Reducing noise is another challenge since air taxis will be taking off and landing in densely populated areas. So is creating enough landing pads to handle lots of aircraft at the same time. A new air traffic control system would also likely be needed.Related StoriesSIRI THE SEXIST Siri encourages sexism by flirting with men who call her a sl*t, says UN GREAT CALL Best OnePlus 7 Pro deals – cheapest contracts from just £43 a month revealed ExclusiveNO WEI!

Football Whispers have called upon their unique transfer algorithm and analysis to determine where will be the City forward's most likely destination.Independiente - 1.4THIS may surprise a few but Aguero has spoken of his desire to return to his boyhood club Independiente in Argentina when he decides to leave City.The prolific forward came through the ranks at his hometown club and enjoyed a three year spell with Independiente, scoring 24 goals in 53 games, before moving to Atletico Madrid in 2006.But, despite leaving the club to make a name for himself in European football, Aguero's love for the Buenos Aires club lives on.Getty Images6 Sergio Aguero may well be on the move at some stage in 2017, with Independiente keenThe City forward generously bought the club a new training ground earlier this year and opened the door for possible return when he said: ""Independiente fans know I will retire from football playing for them.""If Aguero honours his City deal to stay with the club until 2019, the former Premier League Golden Boot winner seems intent on an emotional return to Argentina.However, will that be the next step?Chelsea - 1.2THIS destination definitely wouldn't go down to well with the City faithful but while his relationship with City boss Pep Guardiola seem uneasy, anything is possible.Chelsea have long been credited with interest in the former Atletico Madrid forward and could line Aguero up as a possible replacement for Diego Costa if he opts for a move to the Chinese Super League.There's no doubt that City would do everything in their power to stop Aguero going to Stamford Bridge but if the City striker feels like extending his stay in England once his current deal terminates then Chelsea could make a dramatic swoop for Aguero.Reuters6 Sergio Aguero's exit could be edging close after showdown talks with Pep GuardiolaThe 28-year-old has settled seamlessly into English football but would he be prepared to tarnish his reputation with the City fans for a brief spell in west London?The fact that signing Aguero would weaken City as a title rival would make a potential deal seem even more inviting for the Premier League leaders.RELATED STORIESExclusiveREDS RAID Liverpool scout Leeds whizkid Leif Davis as backup for left-back Andy Robertson A TALE OF ICE & FIRE How Niki Lauda's icy determination drove F1 legend to heroic comeback CITY TRICKERS Watch how City set up Prem trophy smash prank with jokers Aguero and KDB CECH MATE Cech will make decision on future after Europa League final despite Chelsea links WIL POWER Bournemouth eye £25m Liverpool ace Harry Wilson after impressing on loan at Derby Live BlogGUNNER sign?

And, despite being a cult hero with their cross-city rivals, Aguero has always envisaged playing at the Santiago Bernabeu.Reuters6 Sergio Aguero may even consider joining Atletico's rivals Real MadridLast year, he told L'Equipe: ""My childhood dream was to play for Real Madrid.""""I promised my grandfather, who was from Avila some 110kilometres away from Madrid, that I would play there. I realise that it will not be easy, but is always in the back of my mind.""Aguero could also come in for Alvaro Morata who has become a target for Chelsea this month, according to the Metro.Bayern Munich - 1.1BAYERN MUNICH could revive their interest in the Argentina star in the near future after initially trying to sign him as a 17-year-old.According to Sky Sports, Bayern director of football Uli Hoeness travelled to Argentina to watch Aguero play for Independiente and was keen to sign the forward before other clubs in Europe became aware of his talent.Atletico may have beaten the German champions to his signature in 2006, but Bayern could move for Aguero again if City decide to let him leave the Etihad.Reuters6 Sergio Aguero may up sticks and join Bundesliga giants Bayern MunichHowever, Bayern boss Carlo Ancelotti has good options in attacking areas already with Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller currently fighting it out to be the club's number one centre forward.Aguero hasn't yet expressed a desire to play in Germany and it seems less likely that he would move to a new country with a different style of football at this stage in his career."

It is time to utter the Napoli forward’s name in the same breath as any Belgian superstar after a simply stellar start to the season.The 29-year-old, who had scored as many goals as £75million man Gonzalo Higuain in Italy this term, has been tied into a new bumper contract which includes a unique staggered release clause.AP:Associated Press6 Dries Mertens is enjoying a fine campaign at NapoliMertens will be available to any European club for £30m, but offers from the cash-rich Chinese Super League will have to reach a higher figure of £43m.Keep up-to-date with all the latest transfer news and gossip in the January window with SunSport’s daily LIVE blog.However, reports claim the man himself is ready to snub interest from Inter Milan for a ""dream"" move to the Premier League.Football Whispers has taken a look at why exactly Mertens was named Belgium’s Player of the Year last month and has justified his unusual deal.It has become commonplace for Italian sides to guard against having their rivals snatch away their brightest stars by ensuring that the release clauses in their players’ contracts are only valid to clubs  outside of Serie A.related articlesLive BlogDEADLINE DAY LIVE Everton get Mangala loan done as transfers filter through after deadline KEANE ON A MOVE Robbie Keane admits he is in line for a Championship move but NOT to former clubs Leeds or Wolves ExclusiveJOR THE MAN Aston Villa boss Steve Bruce has £10million bid rejected by Boro for outcast striker Jordan Rhodes ExclusiveHOU DARES WINS Aston Villa set to land Conor Hourihane with Barnsley ace determined to sign for Steve Bruce again For example, Napoli were powerless to prevent champions Juventus from stealing away Higuain last summer – albeit for an eye-watering fee.But when negotiating a new contract with rising star and Arsenal target Andrea Belotti, Torino ensured that his £86m buyout clause could only be triggered by teams from outside of the Peninsula.Mertens’ double clause, which essentially ensures that any Chinese side must pay over the odds to land the player, is a first.Getty Images6 Dries Mertens can now be classed as one of Belgium's best playersReuters6 Mertens has scored the same as Juventus striker Gonzalo HiguainReuters6 Mertens has scored 19 goals for club and country this yearClubs from the wealthy Asian division have caused ripples in Europe recently, with Chelsea’s Oscar and Zenit St Petersburg’s Axel Witsel the latest examples to be tempted by the cash on offer.The clause in Mertens’ contract acknowledges that in Europe, £30m for a 29-year-old would be considered a hefty fee – no matter his form – whereas a Chinese side would likely not bat an eyelid in paying such a sum.Napoli have guarded themselves against the possibility of their Belgian forward being snatched away to China by ensuring that any Super League club has to go above and beyond to do so.So what has Mertens done to warrant such special treatment?Well, the former PSV winger has been in scintillating form for the Partenopei this season, and it’s fair to say that his goal-scoring exploits have surprised many onlookers.He was previously regarded as a back-up option on the wing, with the likes of Lorenzo Insigne and Jose Callejon preferred by manager Maurizio Sarri in the wide berths.But Mertens was utilised as an emergency centre-forward when summer signing Arkadiusz Milik was ruled out with a serious knee injury earlier this season.And he hasn’t looked back since, registering 16 goals and two assists in 1576 minutes of action, meaning he has been directly involved in a goal every 87.5 minutes on average.In Napoli’s 5-3 win over Torino last month, Mertens bagged four goals including a goal-of-the-season contender which saw him chip on-loan England goalkeeper Joe Hart from inside the penalty area.Getty Images6 Merens can be ranked alongside the likes of Kevin De Bruyne and Belgium's other top stars6 Mertens has just signed a new contract with NapoliEven as a winger, Mertens always appeared to have the requisite attributes to succeed as a striker: pace to burn, a knack of timing runs in behind the opposition’s defence and a confident finisher.Standing at 5ft 7in, he is not going to thrive through the centre in every system, but his years of acting as the supply line to Higuain has given him an appreciation of how to bring the entire attack into play.He uses intelligent movement to create space for supporting midfielders, while also looking to pick out a colleague if they are in a better scoring position.With a pass accuracy of 76.5 percent, a shot accuracy of 44.9 percent and having created 30 chances this term, Mertens is proving to be the ideal all-round striker for Sarri’s fluid, attacking system.Milik is set to return from injury next month but the £30million Polish international will find it extremely difficult to reclaim his place in Napoli’s starting XI. He may have been a short-term fix to begin with, but Mertens – depending on his whopping buyout fee – is here to stay."

266,"Susanna Reid opens up about her ‘tough’ split, co-parenting and what she REALLY thinks of her Good Morning Britain co-host Piers Morgan",https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2541860/susanna-reid-tough-split-what-she-really-thinks-good-morning-britain-co-host-piers-morgan/,"8th January 2017, 12:15 am","SUSANNA Reid’s rise from student newspaper editor to acclaimed broadcaster is the stuff that career dreams are made of. She’s also the woman credited for saving Good Morning Britain from the brink of certain doom – so it’s pretty surprising to learn that failure is her number one piece of career advice.Fabulous10 As one of Britain's top broadcasters, it may come as a surprise to learn Susanna considers failure as a positive thing“It’s not something to be afraid of – it’s a building block for your success,” explains Susanna, 46, illustrating her point with a quote from acclaimed Irish novelist and playwright Samuel Beckett: “‘Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.’ You don’t have to do it correctly at the beginning,” she explains. “You don’t actually have to be perfect at it. You can keep failing – just fail better, and build on that.”Ask when she last messed up and Susanna chuckles.Fabulous10 In the last three years, Susanna has quit BBC Breakfast for ITV's Good Morning Britain and split from her partner of 16 years“I did a reading at a concert recently, and when I sat down my middle son said: ‘It wasn’t perfect, Mum, but well done.’ Apparently I’d said a word wrong. But that’s just human!”Chatting in the back of a car heading to her home in south-west London after our shoot, Susanna is as warm and engaging as ever. It’s the third time she’s graced the cover of Fabulous in as many years, and boy what changes those years have brought: quitting BBC Breakfast to host ITV’s Good Morning Britain, plus splitting from Dominic Cotton, 50 – her partner of 16 years and the dad of her three sons Sam, 14, Finn, 12, and Jack, 11. So with this resilient personality, does anything scare Susanna?“My greatest fear is something happening to my children,” she says.“But I am pretty fearless when it comes to myself. That sounds like I’m hard as nails and I’m not. Fearlessness just stems from knowing that eventually everything’s going to be OK. Even though I’m scared of heights, I went microlighting earlier this year. Doing what you’re scared of is good for you!Getty10 Katie Derham, Mary Nightingale, Lorraine Kelly and Susanna Reid attend The 61st Women of the Year lunch and awards 2016“When I was 11 or 12, nobody in my class would volunteer for the inter-form gymnastics competition, so I threw my hat into the ring on the principle that I didn’t want to let the class down. I couldn’t do gymnastics, so I did two forward rolls and a handstand – versus girls who were county-standard gymnasts! I made a fool out of myself. It was the most embarrassing moment ever, but all these things give you a thick skin and a fearlessness about performing in public.” Since then, of course, Susanna has become the first lady of breakfast telly – not that it’s gone to her head. “I’ve always had brilliant bosses and many have been powerful, inspiring women who I am grateful to,” she says, name-checking ITV’s head of daytime television Helen Warner, who invited her to launch Good Morning Britain in 2014 on a reported £500,000 salary. The opportunity severed Susanna’s 20-year love-in with the BBC and ended her seven-hour commute three times a week from London to the Beeb’s Salford HQ.Proud of the women who have helped her along the way, it’s no wonder that she has been riled by media reports suggesting that bitchy rivalry exists between the female GMB presenters.On the morning of our shoot, an online story breaks saying Susanna was “mortified” after Kate Garraway compared her dress to her son’s messy play creation.Press10 Susanna insists there is no rivalry between her and the female GMB presenters - although tension with co-host Piers Morgan is another matter“That I continually find annoying,” sighs Susanna. “Kate and I were laughing about my dress. I don’t like it when women are set up against each other. I don’t think men get that quite so often. Sometimes people think there’s a competition between women but – and I genuinely mean this – I have never experienced it. It’s those false tensions that people attribute to women that don’t occur.”Tension with her GMB co-star Piers Morgan, 51, is another matter entirely. As the best of frenemies, the flirty banter and bickering has been likened to that of a couple, and the tension often spills off set, too.“Yes, we do [have arguments],” says Susanna, who’s dubbed “the most tolerant woman on TV” for handling Piers being, well, Piers.“He pushes my buttons, I have to say,” she adds.“There are times I want to poke him in the eye. Sometimes I will tell him if I think he’s gone too far and he’ll say: ‘If that’s how it made you feel, I’m sorry.’ We couldn’t do what we do on air unless we have those conversations. Behind the scenes there’s a lot of mutual respect. I hope I show that I’m no pushover. I don’t think Piers is in any doubt that I can stand up for myself.”WENN10 Susanna admits she and Piers have arguments but insists there is a lot of respect thereTheir high-profile guests aren’t in any doubt of that, either. Susanna takes her position seriously, describing it as a “privilege and a duty to ask the right questions.” Just hours after 17 million of us voted leave in the EU referendum, it was Susanna who put UKIP leader Nigel Farage on the spot in a live interview, in which he admitted that leave campaigners had mistakenly promised to pour £350million a week into the NHS.“That interview has been viewed on Facebook 23 million times at the last count,” says Susanna proudly. Initial accusations that she dumbed down by switching from the BBC to ITV now seem a world away – as are the worrying early days when viewing figures were down by 13% compared to Daybreak a year earlier.“That was the lowest career moment,” says Susanna.“A couple of weeks in, [a story] said the show was going to be cancelled by Christmas. Those headlines hurt.”Xposure10 Susanna split from her long-term partner and father to her children Dominic Cotton in 2014, but they have remained close friendsSince joining forces with Piers in November 2015, viewing figures have shot up. The programme now reaches over 3 million daily, and ITV director of television Kevin Lygo holds his breakfast duo responsible, saying: “It has been the problem child since GMTV stopped, but with Susanna and Piers it’s in really good shape.”Susanna is equally thrilled: “I’m really so, so proud.” There’s noticeable relief in her voice, too, as she talks of the “very strong friendship” she continues to share with her ex Dominic. “It was absolutely our priority to make sure everything was as good as it can be for the children,” she says. That period of her life, she admits, was one of the toughest.“There was a lot of smiling through. You wouldn’t choose to have that much change in quite so many areas of your life around the same time.”Susanna had finished runner-up on BBC1’s Strictly Come Dancing just a few months earlier.“I am at heart a journalist and then a presenter, but around the time of Strictly, the ITV move and the split, there was a lot of publicity on me. You’ve got to be able to handle that, and sometimes that is a challenge. Honestly, everything’s a good learning experience, and it all builds resilience. I was not bursting into tears at work, that’s for sure. Work was definitely a distraction.”Press10 Susanna was in BBC's Strictly Come Dancing at the time of the ITV move and her break-up but she says the experience built her resilienceAccording to Piers, Susanna is “probably the most eligible female in the country” – not that she plans to do anything about it, thank you very much. There are no men on the scene and no plans to find love in the immediate future.“I’m not dating, and right now it feels like absolutely the right thing to be single and independent. It’s a positive choice,” she says. “I am now in a position where I can be with my children as much as I possibly can, because work is in a really good place, and both of those things take up my energy, time and love. I can’t imagine who has the time to then start a new relationship. My goodness…” Susanna takes a moment.“I genuinely feel the happiest I’ve ever been. There will be plenty of time for… [she chooses her words carefully] anything else… later, later, later.”Following all three pregnancies, Susanna returned to work after six months, and never once entertained being a stay-at-home mum, choosing instead to carefully balance her professional and family life. Every morning at around 10am she arrives home from the studio, eats lunch and takes a two-hour power snooze. Sometimes she also squeezes in a 30-minute personal training session before her kids return from school at 3.30pm.Fabulous10 Susanna isn't dating at the moment and is happy to remain single and independent for the foreseeable futureShe relishes the afternoons she spends with her boys, and when work commitments interrupt – for example when Susanna was dispatched to Brussels last March to report live from the scene of the terrorist bombings – she races home first. “I always want to see the children before I go anywhere,” she says.Susanna and Dom sometimes use paid childcare to “fill in the gaps”, but lately, to devote more time to her boys, she has pared back her social life.“It used to be going out to the Groucho club, drinking and having fun,” she remembers. “It was all sequins, sparkles, glitter, glamour and gloss, and now I’m never happier than being curled up on the sofa with the children watching a film,” she says. We meet two days before Susanna spent her 46th birthday with the boys at her mum’s house and enjoyed a low-key lunch. That evening she tweeted “Celebrate every birthday #AgeingIsABlessing”. Not all female television presenters would agree, with research commissioned in 2013 by Labour politician Harriet Harman revealing that just 5% of British presenters are women over 50.But Susanna, who not long ago discovered a non-cancerous cyst in her breast, refuses to dwell – and insists she hasn’t experienced any sexism at work.Fabulous10 Susanna says she hasn't experienced any sexism at work and, unlike many women on TV, has no concerns about ageing“I don’t think about the future [and] don’t see any reason why I can’t carry on working,” she says. “Mary Berry has put her beautifully coiffured head through that glass ceiling.”She exercises two or three times a week to stay fit and healthy, and cheerily admits that although she weighs a little bit more than she would like, she’s not losing any sleep over it: “I can happily sit in on a Friday night eating a huge burrito, a Chinese the next night, and there’s never a better Chinese than on the morning after.”Chomping cold chow mein out of an aluminium box seems the most un-Susanna-Reid-like of behaviour. “Oh, I can eat some really slutty food,” she says.“I am not a paragon of healthy eating.”The youngest of three children, Susanna grew up in Croydon, the daughter of a management consultant dad and nurse mum. Her parents divorced when she was nine, and it took its toll. Frightened that her bottled-up emotions would tumble out during auditions, Susanna abandoned childhood acting plans and turned to writing instead.RELATED STORIES Exclusive'Friends thought I was pregnant' Scarlett Moffatt confesses to crying over her weight and reveals big plans for 2017 Exclusive'I'm always so broody' Michelle Keegan talks marriage with Mark Wright, making babies and moving on to even bigger things Exclusive'Every girl has faked an orgasm' Perrie Edwards and the Little Mix girls talk boyfriends, body image and saucy selfies Exclusive'I'm glad people saw how lovely he is' Frankie Bridge on her jungle warrior husband Wayne and beating depression ExclusiveLowe Down 'Therapy helped me to set boundaries' says Daisy Lowe as she opens up about love, family and those curves ITV10 Susanna has had the opportunity to interview the likes of David Beckham and when asked what's next for her, she simply says she'll take the opportunities she's presented withWhile studying politics, philosophy and law at the University of Bristol, Susanna became the first female editor of student newspaper Epigram. A postgraduate broadcast journalism course at Cardiff University followed, then after her first job with BBC Radio Bristol in 1993, she moved to BBC Radio 5 Live and later into television. It was while working as a reporter at BBC News 24 when pregnant with Sam that she received a chance opportunity to present the 11pm news. “I felt slightly sick, but knew I had to pull it together,” remembers Susanna. “I sat down and started to read the news and after about five minutes I said to the director: ‘How’s it going?’ He said: ‘Really well, but at what point are you going to take your coat off?’ In the panic of the moment I’d sat down still wearing it!”That moment “absolutely” changed Susanna’s career. She moved to BBC Breakfast shortly after, and within a year was presenting on the sofa with Charlie Stayt, becoming a weekday host in 2012. It was a meteoric rise, so what are her plans for the future? “I have no idea – I just see opportunities and take them,” says Susanna, the real girl’s role model who dreams big, works hard, takes risks and embraces failures.For more female inspiration, check out our exclusive interviews with Fabulous Women of the Year (2016), Olympians Laura Trott, Nicola Adams and Jade Jones.Watch Good Morning Britain, weekdays, 6am, ITV."

bandmate Andrew Ridgeley who he met when teensRex Features27The idea for the song, which went on to be No1 in more than 20 countries and top five in ten more, began when George was 12.He said: “I used to have to chaperone my sister, who was two years older, to an ice rink at Queensway in London.“There was a girl there with long blonde hair whose name was Jane.“I was a fat boy in glasses and I had a crush on her — though I didn’t stand a chance.“My sister used to go and do what she wanted when we got to the rink and I would spend the afternoon swooning over this girl Jane.Getty Images27 George Michael on stage with other British pop acts on stage for Live Aid concert at Wembley StadiumThe Picture Library Ltd.27 Crowd shot from 'WHAM! The Final' concert at Wembley Stadium 1986“A few years later, when I was 16, I had my first longish relationship with a girl called Helen.""It had just started to cool off a bit when I learned that the blonde girl from Queensway had moved in just round the corner from my school.“One day I saw her walk down the path next to me and I thought, Where did she come from?’.He said she didn’t know it was him — because a few years had passed and he looked a lot different.George added: “We played a school disco with The Executive and she saw me singing and decided she fancied me.“By this time she was that much older and a big buxom thing, and eventually I started seeing her.“She invited me in one day and I was in heaven.“I couldn’t believe that all my dreams were coming true.“I didn’t wear glasses any more.“I got invited to parties.“And the girl who didn’t even see me when I was 12 invited me in.27 George wrote Careless Whisper at the age of 17“We went out for a couple of months but I didn’t stop seeing Helen.“I thought I was being smart.“I had gone from a total loser to being a two-timer.“The whole idea of Careless Whisper was the first girl finding out about the second, which she never did.”He began another relationship with a girl called Alexis, without finishing with Jane.George said: “Jane found out about her and got rid of me.“I did feel guilty about the first girl — I have seen her since — and the idea of the song was about her.“Careless Whisper was us dancing, because we danced a lot, and the idea was that we are dancing, she knows and it’s finished.All Action27 George Michael with Princess Diana at World Aids Day charity bash“Looking back, the confidence I had for that short period of time is amazing.“I still looked horrendous.“I was way overweight, really not attractive at all, and yet I had more confidence at 16 than I have ever had.“I looked gross but in the mirror I felt great, for no reason.“When I look in the mirror now I can’t get rid of the image of me as a child.“I always see this child trying to look like something else.“I see this kid, this kid who is going to be found out.”George’s dad wasn’t pleased about his son’s desire to be a pop star, trying instead to push him into a proper education.WENN27 The single Faith went straight to No1 in the UK while the album stayed in the Billboard 200 for 51 weeksThe wannabe singer refused to go to private school and his father gave up hope of him getting a “real career”.George said: “Me and my dad were having this big argument.“We were driving in the car and I was playing this demo tape.“I told him there is no way I am not going to try to do this, so the least you could do is give me some moral support.‘All 17-year-olds want to be pop stars’, he said.“‘No, dad’, I said. ‘All 12-year-olds want to be pop stars’.”But bosses at CBS Records saw something different — a potential goldmine.Andrew and George were 18 when CBS signed them for £500 each in a contract that George would come to describe as “professional slavery”.But the problems of his years battling record producers was a long way off.Getty Images27 George Michael hid his sexuality from the media until 1998 George said: “Oh my God, I had £500.“I had never been more flush.“It took me a long time to spend that £500.”He immediately quit his job in a cinema and planned on making the dream he’d had since he was eight come true.He said: “I went into that office and gave up that job as though I’d just become a diamond dealer.“When your real name is Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou you need a stage name fast.”George Michael was born.While everything he wrote for Wham! turned to gold, George learned he did not like the fame that came with it.He said: “For a while it was just absolutely magical.“Playing out your fantasies, and with your best mate, it was a dream.“I was supremely confident that I was writing pop classics but I was also aware that if I left the imagery a bit more to Andrew, kids loved it.”As a child he had watched footage from the Seventies of US teen idol David Cassidy being mobbed by girls on his first trip to London.George said: “There was a shot that stuck with me more than anything else.“He was there in slow motion heading a football around on the top of the LWT building.“The camera panned over the side of the building and there were thousands of girls just screaming, but they couldn’t get to him.“My desire for fame was all locked up in that moment.”Wham!

Bad Boys and the classic Club Tropicana.Their second album, Make It Big, reached No1 across the Atlantic.Singles from that album included Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go, Freedom, Everything She Wants and Careless Whisper.But problems were appearing. George said: “By the time I was 22 or 23 I knew I was chasing something that was making me unhappy.“I had no physical confidence and looked up to Andrew on such a level because he just oozed confidence out of every pore.“Suddenly we were massively successful and I went from being Andrew’s shadow to being the centre of attention.“At that level, somehow I lost all my confidence.“I suppose, also, there was the realisation that my sexuality was no longer a reality for me and I suddenly felt like a fake.“So the whole thing turned me into somebody who felt the camera was my enemy.“It’s not that I’d stopped having sex with women, but I was already fully aware that in itself it was a lie.”Despite his record company pumping out videos and images of Wham! as two eligible ladies’ men, George was slowly coming to the conclusion he was gay.He said: “I had been out to a lot of people since I was 19, and I wish to God it had happened then.“I have to be honest, I don’t think that I would have had the same career.Getty Images27“My ego might not have been satisfied in some areas quite as much, but I think I would have been a happier man.“I came out to various friends and one of my sisters, and I said I was going to talk to my mum and dad.“My friends persuaded me, in no uncertain terms, that it really wasn’t the best idea.“I don’t think they were trying to protect my career or their careers.“I think they were literally just thinking of my dad, they thought he would hit the roof.“Then, very soon after that, everything changed.“Aids was just not something I was prepared to bring into my parents’ life.“I was too young and too immature to know I was sacrificing as much as I was.”27 George with models Christy Turlington (left) and Linda Evangelista (right) who starred in Freedom! 90 music videoThe Wham! hit machine rolled on, making history by appearing in the Band Aid record.In 1985 they became the first Western pop band to play in Communist China.Chinese TV presenter Kan Lijun, who hosted the concert, said: “No one had seen anything like that before.“All the young people were amazed and everybody was tapping their feet.“Of course, the police weren’t happy and they were scared there would be riots.”Despite breaking new ground musically, rumours were by now swirling that Wham! were about to split.George said: “When I decided to split with Andrew, I was in the middle of a very heavy depression.“I had personal problems at the time.“I was going through the end of a relationship and I was feeling very negative about the whole Wham! thing.Getty Images27 George with singer Elton John at gala dinner on behalf of AIDS victims“I was feeling trapped by a lot of things.“I can honestly say that I never lost my temper until I was 22 years old.“And then, for a period of about six or eight months at the end of Wham!, I really lost it.“I was blowing up in areas where I normally wouldn’t.“One time I was with the band’s backing singer, Shirlie Kemp, coming out of Stringfellows and these two photographers just jumped out in front of us.“The flashes just seemed to set me off.“I grabbed this guy and pushed him against the wall, swearing and threatening to kill him.“The other guy got a picture of me, just as I turned, with a nasty expression on my face.”Another time, he had a fight with former bandmate David Austin outside Stringfellows.He said: “Things like that are so out of my character.“It was set off by David thinking I was after his girlfriend.”Wham!’s meticulously planned death throes began with a farewell single, The Edge of Heaven, which reached No1 in the UK in the summer of 1986.It was their final chart topper.Three days after George’s 23rd birthday, Wham! ended it all at Wembley Stadium in front of 72,000 fans.A million people applied for tickets.George said: “It was really perfect. It was the cherry on the cake.”George remembered going up to Andrew at the party afterwards and giving him a big hug.He said: “It was sad. Whatever happened, no matter how much we kept in touch, from then on it was a totally different thing.“It was very sad, very moving.“The fans may have loved the songs but the reason it became as big as it did is because it was based on something real, our friendship.“No way could I have ever done it without Andrew.“I can’t think of anybody I have ever met in my life who would have been so perfect in allowing something which started out as a naive, joint ambition to become what was a huge double act . . . but what was really mine.Scope Features27 George and Andrew snapped with dog“I have never met anyone who would be strong or generous enough to let that happen.“The luckiest thing that ever happened to me was meeting Andrew.“He shaped my life.”Even after Wham! split in 1986 — and the truth about George’s sexuality was pretty much an open secret in the media — he remained in the closet for another 12 years.He allowed the image as a red-blooded womaniser to continue, and even cited affairs with actress Brooke Shields and celebrity make-up artist Kathy Yeung in a book.There was an extraordinary flirtation with Princess Diana after they met at the Live Aid concert at Wembley in 1985.They became close friends, but not before George had fended off an apparent invitation to an affair from the unhappily married princess.In a TV interview he said: ‘There was no question she was very attracted to me.“It would have been disastrous to do anything.”George launched his solo career early the following year.He sang a duet called I Knew You Were Waiting with one of his favourite artists of all time, Aretha Franklin.It went to No1 in the UK and in the US.His first solo album, Faith, was a huge success in 1987 despite the single I Want Your Sex being banned for its sexually suggestive lyrics. MTV broadcast the video, featuring Kathy Jeung in a basque and suspenders, only during late night hours, which in itself was great publicity.George argued that the act was beautiful if the sex was monogamous, and he recorded a brief prologue for the video in which he said: “This song is not about casual sex.”One of the racier scenes involved George writing “explore monogamy” on his partner’s back in lipstick.Some radio stations insisted on playing a toned-down version of the song, which was called I Want Your Love.All the while, the image of George as a ladies’ man was being further reinforced.The second single, title track Faith, went to No1 in the UK, while the album remained in America’s Billboard 200 for an astonishing 51 weeks.George’s life as a hit-maker was just warming up.His next album, Listen Without Prejudice in 1990, went straight in at No1 in the UK charts and reached No2 in the US.Yet despite selling more than a million copies, it was damned by CBS executives as a failure because it sold only half the number of copies as Faith.While the public adored him, many in the record industry thought he was difficult to work with and arrogant.He was certainly not popular with the stuffed suits.The Los Angeles Times even received an open letter from Frank Sinatra, who told him: “Come on George, loosen up. Swing. Dust off those gossamer wings and fly yourself to the moon.”It was here he fell out spectacularly with his record company, Sony Records, which had bought the original CBS contract he had signed for £500.Sony boss Rod Stringer said: “There was a basic falling out over the philosophy of not promoting the record and not providing a video for the first single.”At the time George said: “If my life goes the way I want it to, I would like to never set foot in front of a camera again.”It would take him until 2007 to be free of the contract he signed as an 18-year-old.In 1991, Wham! were reunited in front of 170,000 people — their biggest live crowd — in Rio’s Maracana Stadium.It was here in Brazil that he met his first real love.George said: “It was a strange, strange thing. I don’t know if people will relate to this but there have only been three times in my life that I have really fallen for anyone.Louie De Filippis27 George lost the first love of his life Anselmo Feleppa to Aids in 1993“Each time on first sight something has clicked in my head that told me I was going to know that person.“I met him in that hotel lobby and I didn’t understand why the click happened.“This is a man in a Brazilian hotel, I’m never going to see him again. Why did that happen? This was the first love of my entire life.“This was the first person I ever shared my life with.“I was 27 and I had just started my first proper relationship, which is pretty old really. Unfortunately, within six months I knew he was terminally ill.“So it was a very strange first love. It was very distorted by the situation but it was also a wonderful experience.“It was tragic that I lost him but it was a wonderful, wonderful experience.”peter.murphy@scopefeatures.com27 Wham! duo George Michael and Andrew RidgeleyBrazilian fashion designer Anselmo Feleppa had been dying of Aids.While George was nursing his lover, Sony was suing him in the London courts for failing to publicise the album Listen Without Prejudice.George was hitting back and trying to break free from the contract.Three months after his lover’s death, the High Court ruled against George, deciding the contract he had signed was legally binding.The following year Sony sold his contract to Virgin Records and Dreamworks.George said: “I did sign a piece of paper aged 18 but it was professional slavery.“When you have just made $200million for a company, you expect them to be a little bit patient with you.“It was very obvious I was going through something personal which meant that I couldn’t face the world.“What I was actually going through was dealing with the fact that the person I cared for most in the world had a terminal illness.“I didn’t know how long that terminal illness would be. I didn’t know when I would ever be happy enough to write another song. I was absolutely terrified. At that point in time I had no idea what to do.”His beloved mum Lesley died of cancer in 1997, which was a gut-punch for family-orientated George.Rex Features27 George called the year his mum died a 'dark period' in his lifeHe said: “It was such a dark period of my life.“I thought it was just going to continue that way. I struggled with huge depression, especially after my mother died. I struggled with huge depression. There is a bad combination here.“There is someone who doesn’t take bereavement very well. I don’t think any of us do but some people take longer than others and there’s a situation where you are your own boss.“No one is kicking you up the a*** to get out there and live again and see the positive.”“Two bereavements — losing your lover and your mother in the space of three years — is a tough one.”George believed his biggest scandal, being bust by undercover cops in a sex sting, would never have happened if his mother had been alive.She had known he was gay for four years before her death.When Anselmo died, he wrote to her revealing what had become an almost open secret.After being prosecuted for engaging in a lewd act during the sting at public toilets in a Beverly Hills park, he was forced to reveal he was in a relationship, with American art dealer Kenny Goss.He said: “I was going to get outed one way or another.“I think I was sick of the secret.“There wasn’t any reason to be quiet now that my mother was no longer in this world and I was proud of my sexuality.“It was a strange way of going about telling the world.“I couldn’t do it in the regular way.“I had to fool myself. I am not a liar.“This was one lie I had been trying to tell people for years but something in me picked the most difficult way to do it.”ScopeFeatures.com27 Pop icon George Michael battled with drug addiction during difficult time after his mum's deathBut his other vice, drug taking, would lead him into more trouble with the law.With an estimated wealth of more than £100million, he could afford it.He admitted on Desert Island Discs in 2007 he could easily pay for the 25 spliffs a day he was smoking at one time, though he was trying to cut down.He said: “I am a happy man. I can afford my marijuana. I am constantly trying to smoke less. Is it a problem in my life?Is it getting in the way of my life? I don’t think so.”At the time he went on the radio he was doing community service helping drug addicts and people with mental problems.He had been sentenced to help in the community after driving while unfit through drugs, when he was found slumped at the wheel at traffic lights.A year later he was caught again with cannabis and cautioned.But George was still making records and touring.His 25 Live tour, to make his 25th anniversary in the business, earned him nearly £50million.Despite musical success, his drug habit would eventually land him in jail.XPOSUREPHOTOS.COM27 The singer earned nearly £50 million on his live tourOne of the pals who may have seen it coming was Elton John. George once claimed Elton “lived on” telling people he was worried about him.He said: “Elton lives on that. He will not be happy until I bang on his door in the middle of the night saying, ‘Please, please, help me, Elton. Take me to rehab.’ ”Friends say part of the problem was George became a bit of a recluse, ditching the clubs of London, preferring to walk his dogs on Hampstead Heath.Returning home in the early hours of a July morning in 2010, he was seen on CCTV crashing his 4x4 into the window of his local Snappy Snaps.He was charged with driving under the influence of drugs and possessing cannabis, which got him an eight-week jail sentence and five-year driving ban.For years, George had been addicted to prescription pain killers, and more recently rumours began to circulate that he was smoking crack cocaine.Stories claiming he had been to a rehab clinic in Switzerland were denied.Getty Images27 George Michael with his long-term lover Kenny GossHe did claim being in prison had “re-engergised” his life and he was writing songs again.In March 2011, George released a cover version, True Faith, for charity.He released another cover version, You and I, to mark the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton.That autumn his Symphonica Tour had to be abandoned when he caught pneumonia in Austria.Former lover Kenny travelled to the hospital in Vienna to be at his bedside.Just before Christmas that year, George made a tearful appearance outside his London home, saying it had been ”touch and go” whether he lived.The last single he wrote himself, White Light, marked 30 years since Wham! stormed the charts.He performed it at the closing of the London Olympics in 2012.George was lucky not to be killed in May 2103 when he fell out of the passenger door of his Range Rover travelling at 70mph, going into the outside lane of the M1 near St Albans.He lay dazed and covered in blood as speeding vehicles were swerving around him.Katherine Fox, 23, who used her Mini to shield the star, said: “He was lucky he didn’t die.”27 George Michael with James Corden on the very first Carpool KaraokeAfter the release of his Symphonica album nearly three years ago, George retreated to his home at Goring-on-Thames in Oxfordshire.He was living there with his new boyfriend, Lebanese hairstylist Fadi Fawaz, who looked after singer Katherine Jenkins’ hair.The couple were last seen together in September when he announced plans to re-release Listen Without Prejudice.He was also working on a new documentary called Freedom: George Michael, featuring Mark Ronson, Mary J Blige, Tony Bennett, Liam Gallagher, Stevie Wonder, James Corden and Ricky Gervais.After George’s death from suspected heart failure at home it is not known if the film will be released.Despite all his troubles over the past two decades, George said: “I’m a happy man.“It took years for me to believe that the blows weren’t going to keep coming.”For millions of music fans George Michael’s unexpected death at 53 was a blow that they will leave a massive hole in their lives."

He said: “I wasn’t happy. It was small and not as modern as this. It was too local for my liking.“The thought of the club  knowing where I was all the time felt weird.“So I found this place. It costs me about £1,000 a month and it’s a nice distance away from the club.“It’s perfect to get away from it all during my downtime.”11:30AM – TIME  FOR THE GYMCHANGCHUN YATAI put on just one weekly gym session, so Jack does extra work in a complex near his flat three or four times a week.“I usually go in the morning,” he tells me. “A, for something to do to help fill the day up and, B, it helps my performances, makes me faster and stronger.”The team’s coach is South Korean task-master Lee Jang-Soo.Jack explains: “He loves physical players, ones who run all day and who take care of their fitness.”1PM – LUNCHTIMEPeter Jordan9 Jack Sealy rustling up his healthy lunchJACK cooks for himself and rustles up poached eggs, bacon and home-made guacamole on toast.“All the right stuff to give me energy for training later,” he tells me proudly as he shows off his full plate of nosh.“If I couldn’t cook for myself I’d be stuffed.“I had to learn at uni.“I do like pasta and dabble with Mexican.“There are a few restaurants here but I only tend to eat Chinese food when we dine together as a team.”1:50PM – THE SUN IS SHININGPeter Jordan9 Jack Sealy keeps up to date with the English news with The Sun on his tabletDESPITE living more than 5,000 miles from his birthplace, Jack still keeps up with all the UK news . . . and reads Britain’s greatest newspaper, using the The Sun Classic app on his iPad.But  he cannot easily keep up with friends back home on social media because China’s government has blocked most  foreign sites.He said: “Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp are all banned and can only be accessed through a VPN.“But it takes forever to access messages and  pictures.”2:15PM – QUICK GO  ON THE PLAYSTATIONPeter Jordan9 Jack Sealy enjoys playing on his playstation before setting off for trainingWHEN Jack is away from the training ground, he often whiles away a lot of his spare time playing PlayStation 4 games.He lives alone and admits sometimes it gets lonely.But he said: “I have made a few friends here — they are all English teachers and sometimes we go out together.“But I am quite independent and don’t have too many problems being in my own company.“My family are just a 3½-hour flight away in Hong Kong if things did happen to get desperate.”related storiesExclusiveREDS RAID Liverpool scout Leeds whizkid Leif Davis as backup for left-back Andy Robertson CITY TRICKERS Watch how City set up Prem trophy smash prank with jokers Aguero and KDB CECH MATE Cech will make decision on future after Europa League final despite Chelsea links WIL POWER Bournemouth eye £25m Liverpool ace Harry Wilson after impressing on loan at Derby Live BlogGUNNER sign?

It’s the Korean way . . . they don’t like confrontation.”3:30PM – COACH TO TRAININGPeter Jordan9 Jack Sealy about to board the bus to trainingTIME to head for training. Changchun’s star player is Bolivian striker Marcelo Moreno — who played in the Premier League with Wigan six years ago.Jack says: “Marcelo has 20 goals for us this season so far and has saved us on more than one occasion.”Each club is allowed five foreign players — one must be Asian — and one European superstar has already asked Jack for his views on China.He says: “We played a friendly against Werder Bremen and Julian Draxler asked what it’s like here.  He is obviously interested in coming at some point.”4PM – TRAININGPeter Jordan9 Jack Sealy training with his Changchun Yati team-matesTHE session starts with Brazilian fitness coach Walter Grassmann putting the team through their usual warm-ups before the high-intensity stuff gets underway.Jang-Soo gets the squad working intensely on pressing and keeping the ball. The translating, though, at times becomes farcical.One translator had to relay Jang-Soo’s commands from Korean into Chinese, before another had to interpret it into English.And then it had to be translated into Spanish and Portuguese!Everyone gets the message — eventually!5:30PM – BUS BACK TO THE HOTELJACK enjoyed the training session even though it was gruelling.He said: “We are told to train just like we play.“When we come off the training pitch, it always feels like we’ve just played a full 90- minute match.“This is a big jump up for me because I played at a much lower level that this.“It’s all about being three steps ahead now — thinking a lot quicker and knowing the position you will be getting yourself in much earlier.”8PM – SHOPPINGPeter Jordan9 Jck Sealy juggles some fruit on his shopping tripAFTER a team meeting at the hotel, a quick shower and change, it is time to visit the supermarket.Jack says: “Once training is finished, I nip in here to grab a few things and start cooking. It’s an impressive shop. You have to give the fruit and veg a wash a couple of times to make sure there’s nothing that can damage your stomach.“But you can pretty much get everything that you need and it allows me to be inventive with my cooking.“Normally, I go home and cook myself something before chilling.”8:30PM – EN ROUTE FOR DINNERWALKING past street food stands in the bustling city centre, many locals stop and stare at Jack — because it is rare to see a Westerner around these parts.He tells me: “You try to say ‘Hello’ to them but often they just ignore you.“They’re intrigued because they rarely see foreigners. I once got a taxi and the driver stopped at the lights, turned to me and looked me up and down for 45 seconds.“I’ve even had a guy touching hairs on my arms and putting his arm next to mine because he has no hair on his.“It’s weird but you have to not let it bother you.”9PM – BEER FOR ME, WATER FOR JACKPeter Jordan9 SunSport's Justin Allen and Jack Sealy enjoy a drink togetherWE conclude our day together by dining at an Italian restaurant.While I opt to treat myself to a pint of lager, Jack stays professional and orders sparkling mineral water, with bolognese to come.I ask Jack if he believes the Chinese Super League is the real deal? He says: “For the league to make the step up, there needs to be improvements at grassroots.“And if they start allowing more than five foreign players into each team, I’ve no doubt the Chinese Super League could succeed.”10PM – IT’S GOODBYE FROM ME . . . AND GOODBYE FROM HIMAS we head our separate ways, I tell Jack he must pinch himself at playing in the Chinese Super League — after remembering he used to play on a park pitch in front of one man and his dog at Bristol Manor Farm.He laughs: “Sometimes I do. When you’re not having a good day, not enjoying yourself or feeling a bit lonely, it is easy to think, ‘What am I doing here?’“But then I speak to people back home and they say, ‘Wow . . . amazing . . . I can’t believe you’ve done it and the opportunity you’re getting’.“I’ve only been playing professionally for five years and to think where I was at university and where I am now, it’s unbelievable.”"

They have spent mountains of cash trying to win the Champions League.For once it came down to something else.Sanchez set up Arsenal’s first goal with a delicious pass for Kieran Gibbs and Ozil engineered the second with a faded ball out to the left.Perez, waiting in the six-yard box, tapped in both from close range when Gibbs delivered.It set Arsenal on their way, knowing PSG were unbelievably failing to beat Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets.Arsenal fans, a good couple of thousand of them inside St Jakob Park, were daring to dream. They are unbeaten in the Champions League this season, criss-crossing Europe on this impressive six-match hot streak.The Gunners are always good for the group stage but the next test is the last 16.To progress, to go deep into this tournament, they will rely on Ozil and Sanchez. Who wouldn’t?Getty Images5 The Chilean forward unleashes a shot at goal during the win in BaselArsenal fans have been spoiled over the years with some of the finest players in world football.Ask any Gunner to name their all-time favourites and Liam Brady, Tony Adams, Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry and Ian Wright trip off their tongues.Ozil and Sanchez are in there now. The contract rebels are holding out for eye-watering money before they commit their future to the Emirates.Sanchez has been offered £400,000 a week to play in the Chinese Super League and is using that to up the ante.With every mercurial pass, with every mesmerising chip, their cases get stronger and stronger.They want the big money. Boy, they have earned it.Sanchez and Ozil are the main men at Arsenal — the difference between the dream of winning trophies and delivering them.They operate on a different level.Getty Images5 Mesut Ozil is also in talks over a new long-term deal with the clubWhen Sanchez was substituted 20 minutes from time, he got an ovation from the Basel supporters in the main stand.He had certainly earned it.Sanchez, moved out to the wing to accommodate Perez, made the pass after eight minutes for Gibbs to collect on the left.His cross was met by Perez at the far post and he scored his first with a clever little chip. Basel had a chance to equalise when Matias Delgado met a cross at the far post but David Ospina did well to paw it away. Beyond that the Swiss side were hopeless.Perez scored his second eight minutes later when Ozil cut in from the left and flicked the ball out for Gibbs.The Arsenal full-back crossed once more and Perez was there to tap his effort beyond Basel keeper Tomas Vaclik..@rioferdy5 feels it's critical for #AFC to pin down @MesutOzil1088 and @Alexis_Sanchez, if they're to win trophies. https://t.co/8F7eU7fmhV— Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) December 6, 2016Two minutes after the start of the second half, Gibbs turned provider yet again.This time his crossfield pass was diverted by Sanchez into the path of Perez out on the right.The Spanish strike ace took a touch and then struck his effort low, beyond the desperate dive of Vaclik.That was the hat-trick, a mighty impressive way to remind boss Wenger he signed a tidy finisher from Deportivo last summer.Perez became the sixth Arsenal player — the others being Nicklas Bendtner, Danny Welbeck, Olivier Giroud, Henry and Ozil — to score a Champions League treble.Reuters5 Arsene Wenger was delighted with his team's result in SwitzerlandWith the exception of Bendtner, he is in good company.By the time Iwobi scored Arsenal’s fourth after 53 minutes, Perez’s work for the night was done.Sanchez and Ozil linked up yet again down the left and the German crossed for Iwobi to put Arsenal out of sight.There went in search of more, with Sanchez smashing the frame of the crossbar with a swerving 25-yard free-kick before he was replaced by Mohamed Elneny.He deserved to add to his tally of goals, that is for sure.The Chilean forward scored a hat-trick in the 5-1 victory over West Ham at the weekend.Here he turned provider.He seems happy either way, underling his quality and his importance to this Arsenal side with every passing week.There will be a tinge of frustration that they allowed substitute Seydou Doumbia’s three-point turn to outfox them for Basel’s consolation with 12 minutes left.It was no more than that.This was Arsenal’s night, a night when this group of players came of age in the Champions League.For that, they have the main men to thank.Tweet @neilashton_"
279,Laura Trott opens up about married life with fellow Team GB cyclist Jason Kenny and struggling with the weight of public expectation,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2304266/laura-trott-married-life-team-gb-cyclist-jason-kenny-public-expectation/,"4th December 2016, 12:15 am","LAURA Trott grins as she describes 2016: it was the year she won double gold in Rio then capped her year off with marriage to fellow Team GB cyclist Jason Kenny.“I couldn’t get a better year and getting married to Jason was the best day of my life. Better than any Olympic medal. I loved every minute of it,” says Laura of the September wedding she organised single-handedly ahead of Rio.Fabulous10 Laura Trott became Britain's most successful sportswoman ever after winning double gold in RioSuperwoman is a word that springs to mind.“The Olympics can take over your life,” adds the 24 year old.“That’s all you think about for 18 months [so] it gave me another focus. On rest days, I made my own invitations, the place names and the menus. It took forever!”The groom, meanwhile, had just one job – driving his bride from the ceremony at the church to their reception venue, a 17th-century house in Cheshire where 61 guests dined on sausage and mash, Laura and Jason’s favourite dinner.“Jason wanted 10 minutes [for] just us two straight after the wedding,” says Laura.“He told me he wanted to get an old-style car so when [I saw it] I was like: ‘What is that?’ There, at the back of the church was this bright green Lamborghini!”Wedding cars aside, cycling’s golden couple are anything but flash.Instagram10 Laura married fellow Team GB cyclist Jason Kenny in SeptemberThey live in a “shabby chic to the extreme” cottage near Knutsford, Cheshire, where Jason, 28, proposed on Christmas Day 2014 during an episode of EastEnders.“We’re so far away from diamonds and glitter and I couldn’t be any further away from [being] the perfect wife!” Laura says.She has, however, stuck to tradition by taking Jason’s surname.“I’m still getting used to being Mrs Kenny. Some really old man rode up beside me the other day and said: ‘Are you Laura Kenny?’ I was like: ‘Laura who? Oh, that really is me!’” she laughs.Her four-week honeymoon in Europe with Bolton-born Jason and their dogs Pringle (Laura’s favourite crisps) and Sprolo, gave Laura precious time to recover following her double-gold triumph in Rio.With another two golds to her name from London 2012, she is now Britain’s most successful female competitor in any sport.Success, however, brings a heavy weight of public expectation, which Laura struggles with.“Trying to get back into it with the pressures and everything that the Games in London 2012 brought for me – people expecting you to win – was hard. I was only 20. I don’t think I would have quit, but I did stop enjoying it for a time.”She admits that pre-race anxiety is her biggest weakness and she suffers so badly that she “can throw up with nerves”.It’s possibly why, when asked to pinpoint her fondest memory from Rio, Laura focuses on Jason’s glory.Rex Features10 Laura after winning gold in Rio this summer“Seeing Jason cross the line and get his third gold was probably my best moment. I had no control over it, I was like…” Laura stops to inhale deeply.“I can’t believe he’s just won three gold medals.”The couple vowed to “act like team mates” in the velodrome, but immediately after Jason’s third win they shared a tearful trackside embrace. It was reminiscent of the moment they were caught on camera at London 2012 exchanging a kiss behind David Beckham while watching beach volleyball.Her journey from unknown cyclist to sports idol has given Laura responsibility as a role model to young girls, which she takes very seriously.“If a group of girls came here now and said: ‘I want to get out on the bike,’ I’d think: ‘Job done,’” she says.It would be a poignant achievement considering Laura found herself a target for bullies when she first took up cycling aged 10.“Cycling wasn’t cool,” she says.“There wasn’t a Sir Bradley Wiggins or a Victoria Pendleton and the so-called cool kids used to shout at me because I’d be wearing a helmet. Girls drop out of sport because they don’t feel feminine. I can have really long hair and wedge it under my helmet and show them that it can be done.“I haven’t got the biggest boobs in the world and I would rather have the thighs that I’ve got than be unhealthy and really skinny because of it. It’s about acceptance. Embrace what you’ve been given.”National champion at 12, Laura was on the Olympic Development Programme by 15 and competing in her first Commonwealth Games in Delhi three years later alongside her sister Emma, now 26, who also used to cycle professionally.Rex Features10 Laura and Jason cosying up behind David Beckham at London 2012So it was perhaps inevitable that Laura would end up representing Great Britain at London 2012.Success, of course, requires dedication.Laura trains six days a week, riding her bike for up to four hours at a time.Her immediate future is undoubtedly exciting.Laura and Jason have released a book together, The Inside Track, plus there’s a host of endorsement offers on the table.Next month, she will race at the Senior National Madison Championships and then, fitness levels depending, take on next year’s World Championships.Jessica Ennis-Hill has also helped her realise she can juggle her career and be a mum.“Until Jess did what she did, I never thought that having kids and being a sports person was even possible,” says Laura.So how would she feel if she discovered she was pregnant?“I’d be happy because I’ve always wanted kids. I’d just deal with it,” she says.As for Tokyo 2020, Laura hopes to be selected, but knows she can never rest on her laurels.“Just because I’m Olympic champion now doesn’t mean I’m going to be good in four years. Every time I step on that podium I think: ‘How did I get here?’ Because for me it’s not a job, it’s just fun, which makes me so lucky.”Laura Trott and Jason Kenny: The Inside Track is out now (£20, Michael O’Mara).Jade JonesTaekwondo champion, 23Fabulous10 Jade Jones, 23, was just 19 years old when she won gold at London 2012The evening before our shoot, double Olympic gold winner Jade strolled to her corner shop.“The cashier said: ‘You’re that girl who kicks people in the head!’ I’m recognised a lot more since Rio,” says Jade, whose nickname – The Headhunter – was born from the way she targets opponents’ heads rather than their bodies.Jade was 19 when she won at London 2012, and her defence of the 57kg weight class title in Brazil saw her departing with another gold, becoming the first British athlete to win multiple Taekwondo medals.The journey from London to Rio wasn’t easy.Following her first gold she “lost the love” for the sport she discovered as a boisterous eight year old after her grandad enrolled her into the local martial arts club.“The only thing I had worked towards was London 2012, so when it was finished it felt strange, like an empty feeling,” says Jade.When she announced to her mum Jayne at 16 that she wanted to quit sixth form and become a professional fighter, she was given a year to prove herself.Getty Images10 Jade lost her love for Taekwondo after London 2012 but stuck with it and defended her title in BrazilPA10 Jade after winning gold in Rio 2016: She has had to make personal sacrifices to prioritise trainingWithin two months, she was part of the Olympic Academy and the following year qualified for London 2012.She trains four to five hours a day and as for a social life, forget it!“My friends have always been understanding,” she says.“I wouldn’t say [not drinking] was a sacrifice [but] now I’m older I realise I’ve never been on a girlie holiday – I can’t go on benders all the time.”Dating is also difficult.Single for two years, Jade’s training means she has little time to meet anyone.What qualities would the lucky guy need?“They’d have to be fit, healthy and have some sort of goal in their lives. And they need to know that Taekwondo is a priority.”Jade is shortlisted for the BBC Cymru Wales Sports Personality of the Year award. Visit Bbc.co.uk.Nicola AdamsBoxer, 34Fabulous10 Nicola Adams was faced with sexist abuse when she started boxing but she's proved all her critics wrongShe’s rewritten history in the ring, but outside of it Nicola has battled for more than just equality.The flyweight won her first junior fight at 13, but although her own club – Burmantofts Boxing Club in Leeds, which she joined aged 12 – backed her dream, she faced abuse from rival coaches.“They would say: ‘Girls shouldn’t be boxing, you should be in the kitchen,’” she says.Her answer?“I just got in the ring and showed them how good I was.”And she’s never stopped.Getty Images10 In Rio, Nicola became the only British boxer in 92 years to retain an Olympic goldIn 2001, five years after the Amateur Boxing Association lifted a ban on female competitors, Nicola became the first female boxer to represent England.At London 2012 she was the first woman to win an Olympic boxing title (gold to boot), and the first woman to have won European, Commonwealth and World titles. In Rio, she went down in history as the only British boxer in 92 years to retain an Olympic gold. Openly bisexual, she is proud to be a role model for the LGBT community and is dating a “high-profile US athlete”.A Google search reveals her to be boxer Marlen Esparza, 27.“We’ve been together eight months,” says Nicola, revealing a tattoo on her hand.“It’s the Chinese symbol for love. We have the same one [so] I guess it’s kind of serious!”Aspland10 Nicola is torn between aiming to become a triple Olympic boxing champion or going proAnd her biggest fight out of the ring?“When my mum was sick,” she says.“She got meningitis when I was 13 and was in hospital for three months. She almost died.”Now mum Dee is her No.1 fan.“She is always telling me how proud she is,” the boxer reveals.There’s talk of Nicola becoming a Dame (“that would be so cool”) but she’s torn between turning pro or pushing for gold in 2020.“They’ve never had a triple Olympic boxing champion, so there’s an incentive there,” says Nicola.Nicola’s autobiography Believe will be published by Viking in April.

280,Writer uses Miss Travel dating website to meet American girl in Bangkok for a date,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2291125/this-reporter-flew-from-sydney-to-bangkok-for-blind-date/,"29th November 2016, 8:14 pm","SOME things just don’t work together, no matter how badly you want them to.Like tequila and smart life choices, mullets and any decade post the 1980s and Vin Diesel and a movie with an engaging plot line.News.com.au5 No, I didn’t pop the questionAnd then to add to that list, there’s me and this American girl, Vanessa*.I met Vanessa when I travelled from Australia to Thailand for a blind date.Yep, you read that right. I flew 7500km from Sydney to Bangkok, where I (and Vanessa) stayed in a hotel (separate rooms at the four-star Avani Atrium) for four nights, all for a blind date.Vanessa made the 23-hour-long commute from Miami to Bangkok for the same purpose.Crazy, right?That’s what travel dating website MissTravel.com does — sets up people who want to travel, but have nobody to go with, on exotic dates all around the world.Members can pay to fly their date out, share the costs or just hope someone offers them a free holiday.Men can reach out to women and vice versa. On this occasion, I reached out to Vanessa (I pride myself on making women’s dreams come true).Sounds equal parts romantic, equal parts creepy, no?A BLIND DATE ON STEROIDSNews.com.au5 That’s more gold than I’ll ever see in my walletA MissTravel.com member, Vanessa had always wanted to go to Thailand and agreed to meet me in Bangkok.I’d never been on a blind date before, so I thought I’d prepare in advance by watching David Brent’s experience in The Office Christmas special.My theory was, whatever happened, nothing could possibly be as bad as that.But this wasn’t an ordinary blind date, this was a blind date on steroids.I was bloody nervous waiting for her in the hotel lobby.She came down, we introduced ourselves and headed off to breakfast.We talked prescription drugs, Woody Woodpecker bedspreads, Lhasa Apsos and alternative Chinese medicine. You know, just the standard first date over a latte (kidding, I’m strictly a hot chocolate man) type chat.To state the bleeding obvious, the biggest risk of the blind date is finding out you have absolutely nothing in common with the other person.The risk of the international blind date that lasts four nights is you have absolutely nothing in common with the other person, but you’re stuck thousands of kilometres from home with no fake emergency call coming and no escape.Welcome to my time in Bangkok.Vanessa was polite, kind and friendly.She also drinks wheatgrass juice instead of alcohol, gets her palms and tarot cards read, listens to televangelist preachers and cries during sad movies.Me? I drink VB, think psychics are a crock of s**t, hold televangelists in an even lower regard and the last time I cried during a movie was while watching D2: The Mighty Ducks for the 17th time last year (if you don’t tear up when Julie “The Cat” Gaffney makes the game-winning save against Iceland you have a heart of stone).So you get the gist.Within two minutes of sitting down to brekky (two of every pastry on offer at the buffet for me, yoghurt and fruit salad for her), I think we both knew we were vastly different people. And we had three whole days together to confirm it. Oh joy.On the plus side, at least she knew who Novak Djokovic was (I’m a sports journalist) and wasn’t disgusted by my preference for hankies over tissues (go on, judge away, but I regret nothing).IT WAS UPHILL FROM THE STARTNews.com.au5 One of us is clearly punching above our weight hereBefore this trip I told all my friends, colleagues and family about it. I was a hero (well, maybe among friends, not so sure mum felt that way).Strangely, in my opinion at least, Vanessa had only told two friends the real reason she was in Bangkok. She didn’t want anyone to know why she was here.Now, I know plenty of women ashamed to be seen in public with me, but none who felt that way before I’d even met them!She’d already been on one blind date with MissTravel, about a year beforehand, when a Swiss gentleman flew her out to the Bahamas.She recently found out he’d been seeing someone for the past six months, but don’t worry, she assured me she was completely fine with it. Not bothered at all. No siree.There was no dartboard with that girl’s face on it at her place. Couldn’t be happier.Actually, she admitted she could be happier. If said Swiss hunk and his current squeeze broke up. She still likes him, so I was facing an uphill battle from the start.That battle got harder when she said she only came to Thailand to visit uncles and cousins whom she hadn’t seen in a while.The allure of family was stronger than that of a 24-year-old sports reporter with a patchy beard and commitment issues.Shocking, I know.She first registered on the site because her and a friend wanted to travel somewhere, but didn’t fancy paying for the trip.That was bizarre reasoning to me — someone not part of the “secret society established in the name of attractive girls everywhere” — that you could just decide you didn’t want to pay for something and then wait for someone else to pick up the tab.Just to be polite, I didn’t charge her for conversing with me. Who said chivalry was dead?OH GOD, WHAT HAVE I DONE?News.com.au5 I wonder what a body language expert would make of this shotI won’t bore you with an hour-by-hour guide of how we passed the time, but we visited temples, went to markets and cycled around Ancient Siam.We talked, we laughed (or at least she pretended to) and suffered through awkward silences. Coming up with conversation topics for three whole days with a complete stranger, especially one you have nothing in common with, was damn difficult.More than once we resorted to weather chat — the lowest form of human interaction.On day two we went to the cinema. Vanessa wanted to see a film in 4D (I couldn’t have cared less), meaning we purchased tickets for a screening two hours after our arrival.I was distraught. I’d run out of things to talk about and had to kill two hours in a shopping centre — my worst nightmare.All I wanted to do was sink in a chair and watch a film in the safety of silence. But that opportunity had been ripped away from me.This was the moment when I thought, “Oh God, what the hell have I done?” Forget the weather, I was this close to leading with, “So what’s the deal with airline food?”It was strangely claustrophobic. There was nowhere to go.I wanted to run away and hide and read my book, but I couldn’t just leave, could I?In hindsight, I should have gone off and done my own thing, but what was the proper etiquette here?Therein lies the quandary of the international blind date.

DATING SITE ROW Anger over dating website set up by Muslim entrepreneur to help men find SECOND WIVES IT REALLY FRIGHTENS MENews.com.au5 The back of a tuktuk doesn’t exactly provide the best lighting for the perfect selfieAt first glance, MissTravel.com seems like it would be a prime breeding ground for lonely older men looking to pick up a 21-year-old plaything.Or “gold-diggers”, for want of a better term, looking to exploit wealthy guys.Vanessa went a way towards confirming that suspicion when she told me she’s had plenty of requests from older blokes she deemed too “creepy” to even respond to.Though that’s not to say the site is just a gateway for sex. Members are always booked in separate rooms, and “Escorts are not allowed” sits just under the banner headline in the “How it works” section on their website.They market themselves as providing companionship and connecting travel lovers, and members can undergo background checks before trips are green-lit.Launched in 2012 and now boasting more than 600,000 members in 135 countries, people can cough up for a one, three or six-month membership with the site.To say this form of dating is a little unorthodox is like saying Brendon Fevola was just a little tipsy at the 2009 Brownlows.Vanessa said after our trip she wouldn’t be going on another MissTravel date again.I’m certain that decision had absolutely nothing to do with the male company on her latest expedition.Well, almost certain. I think. Maybe (whatever helps me sleep at night, OK?).I myself would probably never do it again, either.I’m definitely glad I took part in the experience, and I’d encourage other people to give it a whirl if they’re up for it, but the thought of going overseas with someone I don’t know who ends up being my polar opposite again now frightens me more than a world where red frogs cost more than five cents at the school canteen.Or course, there is the other school of thought — possessed by my boss with a crippling gambling problem — that states: “If you don’t win on the first run, just keep punting again and again and again.”Like I said, Vanessa was polite, friendly and kind.It’s just that we were so very different in almost every conceivable way.So it’s back to drinking my hot chocolates and VBs, sitting down to dinner at the ping pong table that recently replaced our dining room table and suffering embarrassing losses on the tennis court.That’s your queue, ladies.

I quit my job and, with a couple of friends, we headed to Mexico.”PA REAL LIFE6 Jeff got the tattoo after he had a dream about the designThere Jeff discovered the symbol of his birth day in the Mayan calendar, used in Central America.“That night I had a dream about that symbol. I had it tattooed on my forehead and along my nose and loved it,” he said.“So, the next week, we found someone with a tattoo gun and I had it tattooed.”The symbol is a moon-shape over his forehead and dots along his brow-line, nose and cheek.“I never had any regrets whatsoever,” Jeff said. “It just felt like something that happened, a spontaneous thing I did.”Related storiesWarning Graphictatt's gross This guy hated the tattoos on his forehead...so he got the flesh SLICED OUT into a weird pattern instead TATTOO VISIBLE The lowdown on the law on body art in the workplace Warning GraphicTAT WAS AN ERROR Man left with rotting pit on his arm after buying cheap chemicals in DIY tattoo removal bid NO REGRETS How to get rid of a tattoo - from laser removal to surgery Video‘I'd chop his arm off if I could’ Miffed wife insists her hubby has his huge ‘Bad Boy’ tattoo removed on Tattoo Disasters When he returned to Mariposa, near Yosemite, California, USA, though, Jeff said people gave him strange looks and children would point at his face.“Some people would say ‘what a weirdo’, but you’re always going to have some people like that,” he confessed.PA REAL LIFE6 Jeff has now started a GoFundMe page to help him pay for the tattoo removalAnd, before long, he stopped noticing people’s negative reactions and became used to living with his unusual appearance.Even Jeff’s parents Helen, 71, and Eugene, 74, who were unsure about his tattoos at first, soon came around to the idea.“I’m no stranger to tattoos. I have a big Asian jungle on my back, a bonsai tree on my legs, Chinese characters on my arms and ankles and an astrological birth chart on my fingers,” he said.PA REAL LIFE6 Jeff is concerned that the unique inking will affect his job prospectsWorking as a road builder was not a problem initially, either, as his trade union found him jobs.“When I arrived for work, people would tell me my tattoo was off-putting to them at first,” he admitted. “But once they got to know me, they were fine.”Jeff met and married Misha Montoya, now 33, in June 2004 and adopted her son Kaiis, now seven.They have since divorced, but Jeff now wants his tattoos removed, to make it easier to find regular work, so he can support Kaiis.PA REAL LIFE6 Jeff has already travelled 8,000 miles to Kerola, India, once for a removal session, but wants four more to remove the inking for good“When I’ve had to find work on my own, I’ve really struggled,” he said. “I never got hired without the union and I think that could be because of my tattoo.“I have a good work record and good references.”Jeff has already travelled 8,000 miles to Kerola, India, once for a removal session, but wants four more to remove the inking for good.PA REAL LIFE6 “When I’ve had to find work on my own, I’ve really struggled,” he said. “I never got hired without the union and I think that could be because of my tattoo.""Despite travel costs of around $1,200 (£965) return each time there and back, it’s still cheaper than doing it in the US, although he can’t fund the pricey trips on his own so has set up a GoFundMe page.In India he pays just $50 (£40) per session, compared to $1,000 (£804) in America.Jeff added: “Since becoming a father and having to face a faltering economy and employers' potential preconceptions and prejudices, towards someone with a tattooed face, I have made the conscious decision to remove my tattoos.“This is to safeguard my ability to support my son and make sure he has a chance to succeed in the uncertain times ahead.“If it wasn’t for my son, I wouldn’t even consider the removal.”"

In a barb at Barack Obama he said: “It is not our fault that Russian American relations are in such a state.”Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said he believed Russian-American relations could get “significantly better”.In Brussels, Euro chiefs Jean Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk issued a joint statement saying both sides “should consolidate the bridges we have been building across the Atlantic”.But terrified European leaders reacted to the shock result by warning the populist tsunami could wreak havoc in next year’s French and German Elections.

The answer may lie in Mr Trump’s “Make ­America Great Again” slogan.Three-quarters of Americans don’t think their country is as great as it was or that it has ever been great.You can understand why. The bloody three-trillion ­dollar war in Iraq suggested there wasn’t much super in American ­superpower.Reuters7 Hillary Clinton greets the crowd at a campaign rally in the rain in Pembroke PinesRELATED STORIESGAS ATROCITY FEARS US warns Syria it WILL respond after 'signs' of deadly chemical attack ME-OUCH Cat owner's face swelled & she ended up in hospital after scratch caused reaction SISTER'S DESPAIR I believe she's dead, says sister of missing Costa del Sol waitress SICK PIMP PAIR Vile couple force disabled woman, 29, to work as a £160 sex slave in shed SEALED FOR ETERNITY 1,000-year-old Buddha statue contains skeleton of 'self-mummified' monk HIT THEM WHERE IT HURTS Spy chief reveals hidden targets US can use to erase Iran threat BABY’S DRUG NIGHTMARE Baby in coma with cocaine and cannabis in system as mum arrested WHO'S THE VLADDY?

In Mr Obama’s home town of Chicago, 17 homicides occurred just last weekend.In another sign of ­America’s tragic relationship with guns, there have been more than 600 deaths in that city this year.With two-thirds of Americans worrying the US is going in the wrong direction, the woman who has been at the centre of politics for a quarter of a century was a risky choice as Democratic candidate.She supported the loose immigration and trade policies that many blame for US job insecurity.She also voted for the Iraq War and laxer regulation of Wall Street. Many spy a connection between her political priorities and the whopping £122million the Clintons have collected from paid speeches to bankers and other rich clients.AP:Associated Press7 Beyonce and Jay Z are just two of many high-profile Hillary supportersAnd a record of looking after the rich is not the worst ­baggage she and husband Bill carry. Mrs Clinton’s attacks on Trump for his mistreatment of women would have more moral authority if she hadn’t attacked the women sexually harassed by her ­husband.Then there are the emails she moved from a confidential government ­computer system to a personal server that America’s enemies could — and did — hack.When the election becomes “Under investigation by the FBI” versus “Make America Great Again” it’s no surprise she is in some trouble.The man who mocks the disabled and pours petrol on racial tensions is not any better, of course.And Mr Trump’s career in business doesn’t suggest he’s capable of even making hotels great, let alone America.Only this week the 65-storey Trump Tower in Toronto went bust.Mr Trump, who is dangerously close to Vladimir Putin, clearly likes ­Russians.He launched his Toronto project with a Russian tycoon but Alex Shnaider is not the first to lose money in a Trump venture. Trump Airlines, Trump Vodka, Trump University and many other Trump-labelled businesses have crashed, burning people much poorer than the man ­himself.The whole world suffers if America’s next presidency goes belly up because, shamefully, other democracies invest so little in defence and security. The US is the globe’s only policeman.Reuters7 Clinton has been under huge scrutiny over email scandalsDuring Barack Obama’s withdrawal from the world, we’ve seen IS rise and Russia invade Ukraine because Putin calculated nothing happens when you cross red lines drawn by President Obama.China also noticed US weakness with its daily cyber attacks on Western businesses, which might one day completely destroy a major institution.Mr Trump’s overall desire is to put “America first” — a slogan used in the 1930s by Nazi-appeasers to keep the US out of World War Two.If a President Trump went ahead with threats to tax Chinese goods and build a wall across the Mexican border, we would see a freeze in global economic relations that would make everyone poorer.Unlike Trump, Mrs Clinton would be “more of the same”. She knows she lost to Obama in 2008 because he opposed George W Bush’s wars on terror and she did not.To avoid being a one-term president, she will need to win her party’s ­renomination and it is moving Left as very liberal younger Democrats replace moderate older party supporters who are, quite literally, dying out.Alamy7 Trump holds aloft a baby in campaign clothingAmerica’s “millennial” generation is scarred by conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan and doesn’t believe in the good the world’s richest, most technically advanced military has done and must do again.It all adds up to a grave moment. Three presidencies in a row have now failed.Bill Clinton’s years saw little done while al-Qaeda, the Taliban and Islamic extremism grow in strength.Bush’s years produced Iraq and the financial crash. ­History will ­remember Obama for Syria’s civil war, Putin’s invasions and an ­Iranian resurgence. American power and ­status isn’t the only thing at stake on Tuesday. The democratic model we take for granted is in peril.AP:Associated Press7 Trump's wife Melania has even taken flak throughout her hubby's campaignMore people are buying into the dangerously seductive idea that ­parliaments, elections and politicians generally are making the West weak.People wonder if, as ­Western ­electorates, we are capable of voting for actions necessary for long-term ­success, such as building airports, global trading systems and reducing the national debt. Many fear we only care about our own pensions, ­benefits and tax rates when we vote.“Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country” was John F Kennedy’s message to America half a century ago.In our individualistic age, few of us ask ourselves what is necessary to make America or any nation great.And sadly, neither do Mrs Clinton or Mr Trump.— Tim Montgomerie is a columnist for The Times."

How incredible.8 There should be no religious artefacts worn on air by news presentersAnyway, I am pleased to report that their verdict was the equivalent of Wednesday night’s game between Barcelona and Manchester City, 4-0 to me.They ruled my piece hadn’t breached their code on the grounds of discrimination, nor harassment, nor accuracy.And further, they signalled my column was simply an expression of free speech and the fact that C4 didn’t like it was tough. All together: Aaaagh.And what did Mr de Pear do with the story on Wednesday night? Did he lead with it? Did he drop it in half way? Did he make it an “and finally”?No, because he got soundly beaten he didn’t run a line of it in 60 minutes.What a gut-wrenching editorial coward he is.Ms Manji made this clear on Radio Four’s Today programme: “I do wear the hijab as a symbol of my religion.”RELATED STORIESCASE CLOSED Press watchdog clears The Sun's Kelvin Mackenzie of religious discrimination over hijab column BATTLE FOR HEARTS & SMILIES C4 blasted for streaming Mosul siege on Facebook Live & inviting viewers to react with EMOJIS MPS' FURY AT LOSS OF BAKE OFF Culture committee set to grill BBC bosses after much-loved show snatched by Channel 4 ExclusiveOVEN GLOVES OFF The vicious feud between telly bosses that could DESTROY The Great British Bake Off A-MAZE-ING Stephen Merchant to host revamped Crystal Maze when it returns to Channel 4 for one off special A decade ago there was a row at the BBC over Fiona Bruce wearing a cross which led to a lot of discussion about the rights and wrongs.There should be no religious artefacts worn on air by news presenters.For some Muslim women the hijab is a sign of oppression.In Iran, Afghanistan and Saudi, not wearing head coverage will mean you end up in court.Let me ask this question: Would Mr de Pear dare to put up a hijab-wearing Ms Manji as the presenter today if there was a Nice-style massacre on London’s Oxford Street with scores dead?Getty Images - WireImage8 Mr de Pear thought he was being clever but he's fallen flat on his faceWe know the answer already. He wouldn’t dream of it.Mr de Pear thought he was being so clever by turning my column into a cause celebre.Instead he fell flat on his face. A win for free speech.On Channel Four’s new website today there is a blog called A Guide To Muslim Headwear.The intro reads: “For some, wearing Muslim headdress is an assertion of religious and cultural identity. For others, it is a symbol of female oppression.”So why do they allow their own presenters to wear clothing that they know causes offence to many viewers? Discuss.CO-OP’S CASHING IN ON YOUDOING the right thing since 1844. Because we are not just about profit.This is the slogan of the charlatans at the Co-op, who boast they believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness and caring for others. It is, of course, pigswill.Take the case that has been brought to my attention by her family concerning 83-year-old Barbara Hayden, who was widowed 18 months ago.Relatives began looking at Barbara’s finances, as her husband handled everything. They were horrified to discover a renewal notice for building and contents cover on her £180,000, two-bed maisonette in Bromley, South London, for £674.She had been with the Co-op for 23 years and never made a claim.Relatives went online, found the same cover for £81 then complained to me.Barbara, frail and hard of hearing, believed in being loyal and trusted the Co-op to do the right thing for her. How many times have I said loyalty doesn’t pay?The family then protested to the Co-op about the rip-off and – surprise, surprise – the company decided they had done nothing wrong and it was up to Barbara to check if there was a better deal out there.Remember the Co-op expression: “Because we are not just about profit?”Why don’t they change it to: “Because we are only about profit?” At least it would be accurate.I urge all families with older members to spend this weekend looking at their relatives’ car, home and gas and electric bills, as I suspect they are being exploited by the nasty Co-ops (and Sagas) of this world.As I have said before, I don’t care if you go to Confused, me at aspokesmansaid.com or whoever, my bet is you will save your nearest and dearest (plus yourself) a small fortune.Do email your saving stories to kelvin@the-sun.co.uk.Hamm’s ideal for EU picklePA:Press Association8 We need a Hammond to add up the numbers in potentially difficult timesTHE Brexiteers in the Cabinet have become quite agitated of late by the actions of Chancellor Philip Hammond.They keep giving disobliging briefings accusing Mr Hammond of being “an accountant”.If what they mean is that Mr Hammond has the temerity to quote the cost of plans and schemes to them and urges caution, I say thank God for Mr Hammond.That is his job. He is not there to be like some mad Gordon Brown character, throwing around money like a man with no arms.I vaguely know Mr Hammond, as he is my local MP.Not a big personality, he would bring a tear to a glass eye, but in these potentially difficult times we need a Hammond to add up the numbers and tell us what is affordable and what are the risks.Actually, it might be a bloody good thing if all Secretaries of State were at least part-qualified accountants, as we would have people at the top who understood that decisions do have financial consequences.I have worked with a number of accountants in my time but my favourite was the finance director of talkSPORT.We were going through difficult times and needed to cut jobs.In order to reduce the number of pay-offs (we were running out of cash) he came up with the cunning plan of turning off the lift of the three-storey building, which meant everybody had to walk up the stairs.He reasoned this would save us on the electricity bill plus the fat ones would start looking for work elsewhere. And it succeeded.After ten days a very large and expensive colleague said his knees would not allow him to keep going up and down the stairs and that, regretfully, he would have to resign.That saved us a vital few pennies. Unbelievably, the FD had the cheek to seek a bonus for coming up with the elevator idea.Perhaps Hammond should hire my old FD – he’s looking for work right now – and get him to cost turning off the lifts across Whitehall as part of the austerity programme.Good idea or what? Kid is a shock HudsonDan Charity - The Sun/Getty8 'Children of Calais' migrant and Rock HudsonAM I losing it or is there something of the Sixties matinee idol Rock Hudson about this chap, who entered the UK as part of the “children of Calais” scheme, shortly to be renamed the “pensioners of Calais” scheme?Face recognition software makes him 38, although entry is supposed to be restricted to the under-18s.Mind you, if Joan Collins ever used the Calais ferry I imagine her computer age would be so old that in order not to offend her they would insist on carbon dating (that’s an old Joan Rivers gag).Alamy8 Boris Johnson has piled on the pounds since starting his new role I HEAR that in his new job as Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson (height 5ft 9in) has approached the state banquets with such gusto that he now tips the scales at an astonishing 17st 7lb.Instead of “Cripes” he now says “Crepes”.I suspect becoming Secretary of State for Health is no longer an option.PA:Press Association8 Abuse directed at Roland Duchatelet should stopI AM 100 per cent behind the various stunts by Charlton fans to force out the non-investing, non-attending, non-interested Belgian owner Roland Duchatelet but I draw the line at surrounding the director’s box and abusing them at point-blank range.It’s called bullying and should stop.In-your-face violence of this kind devalues the legitimate argument.8 Fry-day . . .

295,From coconut oil to CHARCOAL and strawberries… 11 natural ways to whiten your teeth,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/1945423/from-coconut-oil-to-charcoal-and-strawberries-11-natural-ways-to-whiten-your-teeth/,"10th October 2016, 12:35 pm","IT is the stuff of our selfie dreams - a bright white smile.There are toothpastes and mouthwashes, laser whitening treatments and special gels.Getty Images5 A leading dentist has revealed a simple way of achieving the picture-perfect set of knashers – and they are all naturalAll come with the promise of perfect pearly whites.There are even photo editing apps that can, in one (or two) swipes brighten your smile.But, a leading dentist has revealed a simple way of achieving the picture-perfect set of knashers - and they are all natural.Dubbed the King of Smiles, Dr Richard Marques, of Wimpole Street Dental, shares his 11 top tips with The Sun Online.1. BAKING SODA'S NOT JUST FOR BAKINGBaking soda is a natural teeth whitener, Dr Marques said, adding that it is included in a number of toothpastes.He advises mixing a quarter of a teaspoon of baking soda with water, and applying it to your teeth with your toothbrush. The whiter the foods you eat, the whiter your teeth will beDr Richard Marques, Wimpole Street DentalAlternatively, you can add it to your cheap toothpaste.Dr Marques said: ""It will not damage your teeth in any way, but will make them look gradually whiter over time.""Baking soda is a natural cleaning and oxidising agent, he noted.2. PICK UP A PUNNETStrawberries have long be touted as a way of brightening and refreshing your smile.And their secret lies in their acidity.The berries are rich in malic acid, which is a natural cleanser, and can help whiten teeth.However, they do also contain citric acid, which can weaken the enamel - the hard outer layer of the tooth - so  it is recommended that this remedy is used sparingly.Experts say it is best to opt for really ripe strawberries, because as the fruit breaks down the concentration of malic acid increases, while citric acid decreases.Getty Images5 Strawberries are rich in malic acid, which is a natural cleanser, and can help whiten teeth3. USE SALT WATER AS A MOUTHWASHWhile there are countless mouthwashes on offer, Dr Marques suggests a great solution could be on hand, in your kitchen cupboard.""Warm salt water helps both whiten your teeth naturally and looks after your gums, as it's a natural antibacterial,"" he said.He suggested mixing a teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm kettle boiled water, cooled down, to use as a mouthwash.4. GO BEIGEThough dietitians will shudder at the very thought of a beige diet, when it comes to your teeth there is an argument to eat a large proportion of white or beige foods.Related Storiesthey're not all white! The 10 fastest ways to stain your teeth and how to avoid it Exclusive'MY FACE WAS RUINED!' Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace reveals shocking teeth after being tortured by cowboy dentist BEAUTY FIXES How to stop lipstick smudging on your teeth and 5 other beauty tips to improve your daily regime CUT YOUR FLOSSES As dentists now doubt that flossing does your teeth any good, we look at 8 alternatives Revealedroot of the problem These are the real and surprising reasons why we dream about our teeth falling out ""The whiter the foods you eat, the whiter your teeth will be,"" said Dr Marques.So by eating foods like chicken, fish and rice, you are limiting the number of food colourings in your diet.Food colourings stain teeth by binding to the tooth surface.The main culprits are pigmented foods like beetroot, blueberries, carrots and Chinese or Indian takeaways, which are rich in tumeric and other food colourings.That said, it is vital to eat a balanced diet, including at least five portions of fruit and veg a day, so perhaps just bear in mind that bright, colourful foods are likely to stain your teeth and eat them in moderation, or brush your teeth soon after enjoying them.Getty Images5 Like strawberries they are high in malic acid, and so are great at being a natural tooth cleanser5. AN APPLE-A-DAY KEEPS STAINS AT BAYAn apple-a-day keeps the doctor away - or so the old saying goes.But, according to Dr Marques, the fruit can help keep your dentist happy too.Like strawberries they are high in malic acid, and so are great at being a natural tooth cleanser.6. OPT FOR WHITE OVER REDIt's not only the food we eat but the drinks we drink too that can stain our knashers.On a basic level, choose white wine instead of red.But, Dr Marques said it is also beneficial to drink lots of water and milk.Calcium in milk can help to strengthen the tooth enamel and struture, as well as your jaw bone, he said.And water is a natural cleanser, so helps to wash away plaque.7. GO ELECTRICDr Marques is clear - by investing in an electric toothbrush you are investing in you smile.""Electric toothbrushes can remove up to 70 per cent more plaque than manual brushes alone,"" he said.He suggests trying the new Sonicare Black Diamond brush, which vibrates at a speed of 31,000 brush strokes per minute, and also has a whitening mode to remove stains.Getty Images5 When it comes to pearly whites, what you drink is as important as what you eat. When it comes to a glass of vino, opt for white over red to limit stains8. CHEESY GRINCheese may not sound like the obvious choice, but it is another food that is a natural cleanser.And, an added bonus is the fact it's high in calcium too - helping to boost the outer surface while cleansing it too.Your best bet is a hard cheese, like cheddar, Dr Marques suggested.9. RINSE WITH... OILIt may sound like a sure fire way to end up gagging, but rinsing your mouth out with a tablespoon of coconut oil can help whitening your smile.Dr Marques said it's best to swill it around for as long as possible, but anything over 15 minutes is ideal.""This removes bacteria and helps prevent plaque and stains from sticking to teeth by lubricating them,"" he explained.10. VISIT YOUR DENTISTThere is no getting away from it - fear of the dentist or not, have regular check ups is vital.Dr Marques said regularly having your teeth cleaned and checked by a professional is important, adding only a dentist can check thoroughly for cavities.X-rays may also be required to check the inside of your teeth, and your jaw.Getty Images5 Yep, sounds crazy, but you read it right. Charcoal is also another effective way to “help clean and whiten your teeth”, Dr Marques saidAnd dentists are able to advise as to whether laser teeth whitening, using hydrogen peroxide activated by a laser light to remove stains within an hour, may be beneficial.11. CHARCOAL... YES YOU READ RIGHTYep, sounds crazy, but you read it right.Charcoal is also another effective way to ""help clean and whiten your teeth"", Dr Marques said.But, before you go raiding the fire place or remnants of the BBQ, he added it's best to rely on a toothpaste that contains charcoal.""A 100 per cent natural tooth polish made from activated coconut shell charcoal strengthens the gums, removes toxins from the mouth and absorbs bacteria and is affordable,"" he said.He suggests trying Diamond Whites."

Michael Keane reveals moment of dread ahead of discovering his England call-up ExclusiveTHEATRE OF SCREAMS Manchester United kids fear upsetting Zlatan Ibrahimovic at club's mickey-taking Christmas panto BRAD ALL OVER Bob Bradley says his appointment as Swansea manager is 'special day for American football' The communist regime that has ruled this land since 1949 may not yet have produced the culture and qualities to allow top-class football to thrive.As well as the allegations of laziness and jealousy,  there is also a lack of team spirit at games —  surely  not helped by the segregation between the  Chinese and foreign imports.SIPG boss Eriksson and Brazil superstar Hulk, for example, have put Chinese noses out of joint by not staying with them at their team hotel.The club requires all Chinese players and coaching staff to board at the Regal International East Asia Hotel in Shanghai ahead of home matches and away trips.But I discovered on a visit to the hotel that £4m-a-year Eriksson, Hulk and their other three non-Asian imports were exempt from the rule.News Group Newspapers Ltd7Alex Teixeira is another who has moved to play in the Chinese League - yet has failed to be called up by Brazil after doing soAnd an SIPG employee told me: “Sven and the foreigners prefer to stay in their luxury apartments.“It upsets the Chinese players because they think, ‘Why is it one rule for them and one rule for us?’“But Sven lets them get away with it. Already some players aren’t happy because they’re not earning anywhere near as much.”Foreign players in China are treated like kings.Each of them is guaranteed a chauffeur-driven car, put up in a plush space-age city centre apartment and have someone at their beck and call 24 hours a day.Chinese football expert Lu Win said: “They only have to click their fingers and people will run around for them.“If Hulk says he’d like to look at some Harley-Davidsons to buy, there will be a whole fleet of them outside his home in less than a couple of hours.”Culturally, this is a country that can be a shock to visitors.News Group Newspapers Ltd7And ex-Chelsea man Ramires took the decision to move over to play in the Far EastOn the streets you see and hear people clearing their throats from the pollution by spitting in the street.English defender Jack Sealy, 29, who plays in the north of the country for Changchun Yatai, believes it can be difficult for the Wags of foreign stars.He said: “It certainly can take some getting used to. I sense it can be boring for the wives and girlfriends. They sit around all day waiting for their husbands to come home and lead a lonely lifestyle. It can’t be much fun.”One tout in Shanghai told me he was struggling to shift an £18 SIPG ticket for less than a tenner.AP:Associated Press7 Xi Jinping has said that he believes China can win the World Cup by the year 2028He said: “People in China love football but the game here isn’t good enough to really get people to the stadiums.”But they certainly flock to the Camel Sports Bar in Shanghai to watch Prem stars in action.For the Manchester derby the boozer was packed to the rafters.And it was clear to see United are the biggest English club in China with the amount of red shirts on display.United fan and China Reds member Youki Bao said: “Man U have conquered football hearts here. City are way behind.“Chelsea, Arsenal and probably Liverpool are the other big English teams in China.”And it is the Premier League’s pulling power that is inspiring so many billionaires out here to want to buy English clubs.Chinese football expert Shao Jin said: “The Premier League is the most popular sport brand in China.“Although the Super League is hoping to one day be as big, a lot of business people here see instant possibilities and success in buying English teams.Getty Images7And former Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has decided to take up a management position in China“Over here so much work needs to be done to grow Chinese football but in England, it’s engrained in your culture.“Chinese businessmen see England as a far safer and a faster financially rewarding investment.“Also because of the popularity of the Premier League in China, there is a lot of prestige in owning an English club.”It is true Chinese clubs have the financial muscle to buy any player on the planet.But the simple truth is that A-listers like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo will not consider playing here until they are past their sell by date.Reuters7 Hulk signed for Shanghai SIPG in JulyAlex Teixeira, Ramires and Hulk are big names but none of them have played a single minute for Brazil since setting foot in China.President Xi Jinping wants China to win the World Cup by 2038.But for all the millions of pounds spent on youth development, on impressive complexes and on foreign coaches, I did not once  see  kids in parks kicking a ball about with jumpers  for goalposts.And until you see that, his ambition is surely a pipe dream.Tweet @justinallen1976Watch ALL the goals from the Premier League before anyone else for FREE plus all the latest news, fixtures and results and live match commentary all on the go with the new Sun Football App – click here to download"
297,Bright blue skies await you when you visit the volcanic landscape of Lanzarote,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/1894424/bright-blue-skies-await-you-when-you-visit-the-volcanic-landscape-of-lanzarote/,"2nd October 2016, 1:20 am","WITH a palette of blacks, browns and greens, Lanzarote’s dramatic landscapes can make you feel like you are trapped in a bizarre dream.Or the imagination of a colourblind painter.Getty Images7 Nice View...local beachBut a flash of bright blue — courtesy of the skies above the island and the waves that lap at its 121 miles of coastline — brings you back to reality.One of the larger Canary Islands, Lanzarote is only 77 miles from the Sahara desert.It has average temperatures of 21C and just 20 days of rain a year.Lanzarote’s famous black sands are a reminder of its volcanic origin.The island rose from the sea millions of years ago.Getty Images7 Raquel Welch's One Million Years B.C. was filmed on the islandBut it is not only geological nerds who will get excited by the island — it has plenty of pop ­culture, too.The Raquel Welch vs dinosaur campfest One Million Years B.C. was shot here, as were The Stone Roses’ Fools Gold and I Wanna Be Adored videos.The Green Lagoon — acidic seawater trapped behind a bank of jet-black sand — is a sight to behold.And a totally alien landscape compared with its neighbour, the fishing village of El Golfo with its picturesque white houses.Alamy7 Strange Lanz...Timanfaya's volcanic attractionAn afternoon quad-biking is another way to experience the island’s nature close up.And get a thorough covering of nature’s bronzer — dust.We stayed at the 4H Barceló Teguise Beach, an adults-only hotel offering half-board and, most crucially, no shrieking kids (or parents) interfering with your tanning time.Airy and modern after a full refurb last year, the hotel is ­popular with newlyweds, couples and those just looking for some peace and quiet.It’s just 100metres from Las Cucharas beach, on Costa Teguise, which is popular with scuba divers and paddleboarders and every July is the backdrop for the World Windsurfing Championship.7 Sea views...LanzaroteThe Barceló features two bars, each ideal for a leisurely evening cocktail, and two restaurants — the somewhat disappointing Champs Sports Bar and the Atlantic Buffet, which serves a nightly feast with something to appeal to most.There is a huge selection of salads, local cheeses, a pasta bar, sushi, plus Chinese dishes, steak and fish cooked to order, plus a range of decadent puddings.Vegetarians and vegans might struggle, though, and those with gluten intolerance will want to research other places to eat.The Barceló’s chefs prepare nightly themed menus that would even keep excited the tastebuds of people staying for a fortnight.Getty Images7 Tourists stick to Lanzarote's popular seaside resortsBut if you tire of in-hotel dining, there are other options right on your doorstep.Fancy a curry?Lanzarote’s “Best Indian” is a minute’s walk away and offers a set menu for less than £9.In fact, stroll outside the hotel and you could be back in the UK, with a Chinese all-you-can-eat buffet, Irish bars, karaoke and a greasy spoon serving all-day breakfasts for just £3.There is even a shop where you can pick up your copy of The Sun.And English channels beamed straight into the hotel’s rooms mean you do not need to sacrifice watching The X Factor or the goings-on in Albert Square for the sake of a sunshine break.Away from the hotel’s two pools, spa and general aura of tranquillity, 187 of Barceló’s 305 rooms feature a hot tub.7 Adults only...Barcelo TeguiseRelaxing in a Jacuzzi on the balcony is the perfect place for watching the sun set with a glass of champagne — or sharing a bottle of wine from award- winning local vineyard Bodegas El Grifo, which is well worth a visit.Lanzarote’s hard, volcanic soils may look barren but grapes thrive under the island’s blazing sun — and make its white wines stronger than its reds.But getting the vines to take was no easy feat — and a tribute to the peasants who cultivated the land, El Monumento al Campesino is an interesting place to visit and to stop for lunch.In the centre of Lanzarote, it is easily accessible if you hire a car or take an organised tour.Lanzarote’s gastronomic delicacies are well worth trying, too.The fried goats’ cheese is delicious.As is bienmesabe — a sweet pudding made from sugar, almonds and egg yolks.7 Lunar landscape...LanzaroteSea bream, known locally as chern, is a popular offering and will have been fished locally.The island is also famous for its mojo sauces: a fiery red picón and a parsley or coriander-based green one.These are served with small, wrinkly potatoes grown on the island.Hotter than the mojo sauces is Unesco world heritage site the Parque Nacional de Timanfaya, known as the Fire Mountains, where lava trapped within the earth bubbles beneath the ground.One of the dormant volcanoes has an inner temperature of more than 800C and the on-site restaurant, designed by local artist César Manrique, takes full advantage of the geothermal conditions, using it to cook succulent meats for tourists and locals.A look inside a chimney made from lava stone reveals trays of chickens being roasted using only the hot air from the molten rock below ground.Related StoriesVideoSEA RESCUE Dramatic moment six Brit tourists are rescued from their sinking fishing boat off coast

School holiday dates in England, Scotland and Wales Timanfaya’s last eruption, back in 1730, lasted six years.More than 100 volcanoes and volcanic cones rose from the Earth in a torrent of fire and smoke, with locals to believe they were trapped in hell and being punished for all of humanity’s sins.Villages were destroyed and livestock died as red-hot lava seeped from the earth and ash made the sky turn black.Two apparitions of the ­Virgen de los Dolores — Our Lady of Sorrows — later convinced them that they were being protected by the Holy Ghost, not persecuted by dark forces.Ever since, an annual celebration has taken place every September.Thankfully, there has been no volcanic activity on the island since 1824.And the only spirits that lurk on the island are found in cocktails.GO: LANZAROTEGETTING THERE: Monarch operates year-round flights to Lanzarote from Birmingham, London Gatwick, London Luton and Manchester airports with fares starting at £69 one way (£130 return).

rather than out of a genuine sense of patriotism and wanting to do away with this kind of EU elitismJean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, claims 17million naive British morons voted to leave because we swallowed “40 years of lies”.Unforgivably, Juncker even blames the horrible murder of Arkadiusz Jozwik in Harlow on the British vote to leave.“Europe can never accept Polish workers being harassed, beaten up or even murdered in the streets of Essex,” said Juncker, to rapturous applause in the chamber.How dare this booze-soaked bureaucrat imply that those of us who voted for our independence from his corrupt, job-destroying EU are somehow less appalled by the murder of an innocent man?You would never guess that there is a long list of EU nationals who have committed horrible crimes in this country.EPA17 Juncker blames the murder of a Polish man in Harlow, Essex on BrexitEPA17 His sweeping condemnation of an entire country ignores the immense backlash against the killing with tributes and a solidarity march in Harlow town centreAlamy17 Arkadiusz Jozwiks death was mourned with moving tributes from his neighbours and fellow Harlow residentsPole Damien Pankiewicz was sentenced to 12 years for beating then dragging a stranger into the road in front of an oncoming double decker bus.Lithuanian Victor Akulic, who was jailed for life for a violent rape.Romanian Ciprian Stanescu was jailed for eight years after raping a woman who had been stranded at London’s Victoria Station.But most EU immigrants have not broken the law — just as the majority of them have not suffered racist attacks.Yet you would never know it from a Brexit-shaming celebration on BBC Radio 4 about the impact of Brexit on Poles living in the UK, where the Guardian hack presenting took great delight in finding graffiti urging, “Vote out EU — get the c**** out.”It’s not pleasant.But it is hardly Nazi Germany.It is not even Merkel’s Germany, where neo-Nazi yobs last week fought running battles with drunken migrant youths in Bautzen, between Dresden and the Polish border.DPA/XCITEPRESS17 The situation in Germany is worse than in Britain with huge tensions surrounding migrationDPA/XCITEPRESS17 Around 80 right-wing neo-fascists recently clashed with 20 immigrants residents in Bautzen, near Dresden, and the fighting was broken up by policeMigrant centres are not being burned in the UK.They are being torched in France and Germany.Voting to leave the European union did not change the nature of the British people.We are a proud, confident, independent nation.Given the chance to take back control of our borders, to restore our national sovereignty, to create our own destiny, we were always going to grab it with both hands.But leaving the EU is not about hating anyone.Getty Images17 The decision to leave the EU isn't about hate - it's about a deep love for our country and wanting to take it back from EU bureaucratsIt is about loving our country — and wanting it back.That does not make us, Britain, a nation of stupid, racist bigots.I am proud that more than 17 million of my countrymen defied all the doom-mongers and voted to leave the EU.The Brexit shamers should look in the mirror and reflect on the poisonous contempt they feel for the will of all those British people.Because that is exactly why they lost.-- A CHORUS of voices on the Left assured us that there was no prospect of the European Union ever starting its own army.“A fantasy!” chortled Nick Clegg.Now comes news of the EU forming a “joint military force” to stand up to the Russians.Vladimir Putin must be quaking in his boots.With laughter.Chance to save a Priti pennyPA:Press Association17 International Development Secretary Priti Patel wants to radically change the way we spend on foreign aid - as current investments are a waste of taxpayers' moneyPRITI PATEL, the Secretary of State for International Development, is threatening to end the grotesque waste of our bloated £12billion-a-year foreign aid budget.In the name of foreign aid, the British taxpayer has chucked money at such nutty schemes as encouraging the Chinese to play football (£3million), bankrolling Yegna, an Ethiopian version of the Spice Girls (£4million) and fighting climate change by reducing flatulence in Colombian cattle (£15million).We Brits are a generous bunch.When there is a crisis in some faraway land, nobody is quicker to put their hands in their pocket.But our foreign aid budget doesn’t make us look compassionate – it makes us look like the biggest bunch of mugs in the world.17 In the past Britain has invested £4million in Yegna, the Ethiopian Spice Girls who aim to empower women in the African nationGetty Images17 We've also spent £15million fighting climate change... by combating excessive farting of Colombian cowsIt should be noted that Priti Patel is not threatening to reduce the amount of money spent on foreign aid, currently fixed in law as 0.7 per cent of national income.She merely wants it spent on better causes than farting moo-cows in South America.You would think that we would all unite around Priti Patel.You might believe that, whatever your political persuasion, we can all agree that billions of foreign aid are currently being stolen, frittered away and wasted.But her plans caused howls of outrage.You can understand the concern.Where will all those Third World despots get their next private plane from now?Drive to end calls at the wheelFame Flynet17 Texting while driving today will soon be as taboo as drink driving - it's simply not safeWHEN I was learning to drive in the Seventies, drunk-driving was socially acceptable in a way that would be unimaginable today.It was everywhere.Boy racers did it.Old geezers did it.Housewives did it.Then the world got wiser and today the idea of getting behind the wheel when you are half-cut is unthinkable.Anyone who does it is well aware that they are risking their own life and liberty and the life of any innocent who gets in their way.Only an idiot drives when drunk in 2016.But almost everyone messes about with their phone at the wheel.SWNS:South West News Service17 Laura Thomas died at just 20 when she collided with a lorry while distracted watching porn on her phoneLisa Thomas, 47, says she feels “sick” every time she sees someone using their phone while they are driving.Mrs Thomas’ daughter, Laura died at the age of 20 when a lorry driver hit her while watching porn at the wheel – one of the hundreds of innocent victims of what we can call phone-driving.As the parent of a child who walks to school, I feel sick when I see the army of morons who use their phones while driving.They are everywhere.The penalties for driving while phoning – small fines and penalty points – are stupidly lenient.But the real problem is that phone-driving is socially acceptable.Until decent, right-minded people stop doing it, our children will keep dying.Death might be glorious for Sharon - but not for meGetty Images17 Sharon Stone said her near-death experience was ""glorious"" and not scary at all - but my experience of loved ones dying is simply tragic and upsettingAFTER suffering a brain haemorrhage in 2001, Sharon Stone had a near-death experience and reports seeing “a giant vortex of white light” and meeting many friends long gone from this world.“When death comes, it’s glorious and beautiful,” says Sharon, left.“I had an incredible sense of wellbeing.“It’s not scary.”Wouldn’t it be comforting to think so?But my experience of watching loved ones die is exactly the opposite.From what I’ve seen of it, death is full of pain, grief and a crushing sadness at saying goodbye.When I go, I hope I go like Sharon.Labour is broken regardless of who wins leadershipGetty Images17 Labour voters have the delight of choosing between two unelectable fools in the current leadership content - the only outcome will be the party's demiseTHE Labour leadership contest, which will be decided next Saturday, is starting to get exciting.Will Labour choose to be led by an eye-swivelling extremist who has no hope of ever winning a General Election?Or will they stick with Jeremy Corbyn?Corbyn and his henchman, IRA groupie John McDonnell, dream of bringing down capitalism.But all they are bringing down is the Labour Party.No regrets at Cameron's political passingGetty Images17 David Cameron will be remembered for always doing exactly the opposite of what he always promised“BRITS don’t quit,” David Cameron said two days before he quit as Prime Minister and little more than two months before he quit as an MP.Even more than the bloody mess he left in Libya, Cameron will be remembered for saying one thing then doing exactly the opposite.Call me a naive young thing but when he looked the British people in the eye and promised to negotiate a new deal for the UK in Europe, I never doubted for one second that he was going to have a real go.And then he didn’t.Even those of us who voted for Cameron in two General Elections are glad to see the back of him.related storiesTAKING BACK CONTROL Take back your criminals or lose your overseas aid -

His loss. Hull's lovely at this time of year. 7.54: Breaking news from Hull who are about to make a shock signing. 56 year old Dean Windass joins...Nah just kidding.

Ken Lawrence confirms a departure we were expecting...Eliaquim Mangala has completed a one-year loan deal to Valencia.The 25-year-old centre back who cost Manchester City £42M from Porto just two years ago becomes the fourth played to be dumped by boss Pep Guardiola.He joined England No 1 Joe Hart who moved on loan to Torino, Wilfried Bony who joined Stoke and Samir Nasri who like Mangala will be playing in La Liga with Sevilla.Getty Images33 Eliaquim Mangala has left Man City on loan after an error-prone two years17.06: Middlesbrough have agreed a £7million deal for Adam Reach to join Sheffield Wednesday, says Mike McGrath.Boro boss Aitor Karanka has given the green light for the winger to be part of Wednesday’s promotion campaign in the Championship after signing Adama Traore from Aston Villa.Reach, 23, was a regular two seasons season in the second-tier but was then loaned out to Preston for the last campaign.Karanka has decided to let him go after getting the right price for Wednesday for a squad player.16.57: DONE DEAL!

Here's what Graeme Bryce has to say on the matter...Leicester's officials are clocking up the miles as they try to push through their transfer business for the day.The Foxes have been represented in Lisbon as they chase Sporting Clube de Portugal’s Islam Slimani.They were also in Bologna as the player flew there from Algeria’s world cup camp to undergo a medical and finalise the finer details of his £29.8million move.It’s been a long day for Leicester’s transfer team but it is the biggest transfer deal in their history and there are a lot of details to be ironed out.Word from Leicester is progress is painstaking but positive and there is no reason to believe they won’t end the day with the biggest signing in their history.Hopes of a double swoop for Slimani’s teammate and Sporting skipper Adrien Silva are waning however as Sporting are not bursting a gut to sell a fans’ favourite.Meanwhile, Leonardo Ulloa is wanted by West Brom andSunderland but Leicester are in no rush to lose the big striker, especially as the Slimani deal is not quite across the line yet.Getty Images33 Leicester are working hard to bring in Sporting Lisbon striker Islam Slimani16.38: Here's an update on Tony Pulis' West Brom for you...

Some news for Liverpool fans out there, from Phil Thomas...Luis Alberto's departure from Liverpool has finally been confirmed.The Spanish winger has just completed a £4.3million switch to Lazio, plus add-ons, and 30 per cent of any profit on a future transfer.Alberto, 23, cost nearly £7m from Sevilla three years ago, but never came close to nailing down a regular slot and started only two games.He has spent the last two seasons on loan at Malaga and Deportivo La Coruna, tempting Lazio into a permanent move with his performances in the latter.News Group Newspapers Ltd33 Luis Alberto has joined Serie A side Lazio for an initial fee of £4.3million16.22: DONE DEAL!

Always a major hint.On top of that, PSG are already reportedly chasing a replacement, lining up Sao Paolo defender Rodrigo Caio.So... Done deal?15.24: It's really all kicking off here, with even more West Ham news. We're on a roll here, chaps.Along with Wolves' Dominic Iorfa - as we previously mentioned - Slaven Bilic has now turned his attention to former Liverpool right-back Alvaro Arbeloa.The ex-Real Madrid man has been out of a club since June - and was a deadline day move himself when he joined Rafa Benitez's Reds in January 2007.News Group Newspapers Ltd33 Alvaro Arbeloa was quietly a key player for Liverpool under Rafael Benitez15.22: Some news coming out of Liverpool from our man Phil Thomas...Tiago Ilori is set to stay at Liverpool after two proposed moves broke down.The Portugese defender was wanted by both Granada and Valencia, but both clubs were only interested in loan deals for the rest of the season.Yet Liverpool would only let him go on a permanent basis – and not for a cut-price – which put the blocks on his leaving.Now Ilori can look forward to life in the Under 23s at Anfield, after being told that he will not be considered for first team action.Ilori, 23, was a £7million buy from Sporting Lisbon three years ago but has made only three FA Cup appearances for the Reds.He has previously had two six month loan spells with Granada and Bordeaux, and another three-month loan at Aston Villa last season.33 Liverpool defender Tiago Ilori could finally be on the way out of Anfield15.20: They're quickly becoming the most active team of the past 24 hours, are Hull City...Here's the latest from our man Mike McGrath...Hull are trying to put a deal together to take Dieumerci Mbokani on loan.The Dynamo Kiev striker was at Norwich last season on a short-term contract before returning to Ukraine.And he is wanted in a return to the Premier League to bolster Mike Phelan's attack.The 30-year-old scored seven times in 15 starts for Alex Neil but it was not enough to avoid relegation to the Championship, although his quality has prompted Hull to look into a season-long loan.Getty Images33 Alan Pardew and Eddie Howe have gone head-to-head in the battle to sign Jack Wilshere on loan from Arsenal15.18: He may on the brink of a move to Roma, but Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew has had his say on Jack Wilshere's hunt for a loan move.Pards said: “Jack is a player that became available yesterday, so it would be silly not to get involved in that.“Obviously there’s a lot of clubs that would like Jack, and I guess we’re one of them. But we’ve done so great in this window, it really would be the icing on the cake if we could get him across the line.“We’ve got other targets that we’re pursuing as well today, so we’re having a look at those as much as we’re looking at Jack. In terms of where we stand, if we didn’t get anyone across the line I’d still be very, very pleased.”So there you have it, you can indeed expect some more action, Eagles fans...15.14: Wowza, this is a big one for you Chelsea fans out there...Twitter33 David Luiz poses for a picture amid claims he has arrived at Heathrow ahead of a return to ChelseaThe Paris Saint-Germain star has been spotted 'arriving at Heathrow' ahead of a potential deadline day move back to Stamford Bridge.What a story that would be...15.06: Bitter blow for Tottenham fans, this...Sky Sports' Spanish expert Guillem Balague has claimed Isco will NOT be leaving Real Madrid today.He said: No, Isco is not going to Spurs and I think he’s announced in the last few minutes that he is staying.“It’s something that he’s toyed with, I’m pretty sure there have been conversations between Spurs and Isco, but it’s not going to happen, I think he’s happy to fight for his position.”Mauricio Pochettino and Co were hoping to add a splash of Champions League quality to their squad today as they look to compete in both the Premier League and Europe's elite competition.14.55: Here's the full story on Samir Nasri - who has joined Sevilla on loan for the season...Getty Images33 Samir Nasri chose a move to Sevilla over Besiktas and has now left the Etihad14.50: Another loan deal for you, this time involving Chelsea's Christian Atsu.Newcastle have landed the Ghanaian star for the full season.Who saw that coming?

Stay tuned to find out...13.54: We're also hearing that Roma are making 'significant efforts' to sign Jack Wilshere on loan. Those 'significant efforts' presumably include preparing a special inflatable area so he doesn't injure himself falling off his chair when he signs. And finding a child's crayon for him to use so he doesn't stab himself in the eye. Maybe one player coming in today!!!— Jack Sullivan (@jsullivanwhu) August 31, 201613.47: Feeling left out West Ham fans? We have news... 13.40: Another wanted man by Championship clubs is CAMERON McGEEHAN. Several second tier clubs have had bids rejected for the Luton midfielder.McGeehan, 21, has had a stunning start to the season with four goals already, including one in the 3-1 win over Aston Villa in the EFL Cup.Brentford have been widely linked to the former Chelsea kid. The Bees have already raided the lower leagues this summer by bringing in Dan Bentley from Southend and Romaine Sawyers from Walsall. 13.34: If you missed the big news earlier, it’s that Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic is having a medical after news breaks that he’s in talks to sign Emmanuel Adebayor 13.23: WEST BROM have finally entered the deadline-day action. The Baggies are on the brink of announcing they have signed Watford right-back Allan Nyom for £3million, writes Graeme Bryce.The Cameroon international (28) made 32 appearances for the Hornets last season and will fill a problem position for Albion, who have been using centre half Craig Dawson as a stand-in full-back.Tony Pulis is also ready to throw his baseball hat in the ring for Newcastle United’s French midfielder Moussa Sissokho but faces stiff competition from Spurs who have Champions’ League football to woo Sissokho with.Baggies will hope to tempt the Magpies by offering winger Callum McManaman plus cash for the midfield powerhouse. However Pulis will be happy to get another signing target on board, as Nyom heads for a medical.West Brom splashed out £13million on Spurs midfielder Nacer Chadli earlier this week but are planning on five signings by tonight's 11pm deadline.Welcome to Villa, Adomah! #UTV @AVFCOfficial pic.twitter.com/ZE5SlOgQ8p— Dr. Tony Xia (@Dr_TonyXia) August 31, 201613.14: DONE DEAL! STOKE CITY have completed a season-long loan deal for Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony - and have still not given up on signing West Brom’s Saido Berahino. Potters boss Mark Hughes has been chasing Berahino all season but he has not been allowed to leave Albion until boss Tony Pulis gets in a replacement. Bony’s arrival means that Hughes now has the extra firepower he wants. But if he can add Berahino to his squad, he will. Hughes said: “Bringing Wilfried in was a no-brainer for us because he knows the Premier League and has scored plenty of goals at this level. “He has power, speed and very good physical attributes which will undoubtedly help us, and his technical and finishing skills are outstanding too. “Eighteen months ago he was being bought for a hugely significant amount of money, so we know that we are bringing in a top quality striker.” It is likely that Stoke will have come to an arrangement over Bony’s wages - his Etihad salary is £110,000 a week so City will have to pay some of that. Hughes added: “Everybody is aware of Wilfried and what he is capable of, and it was no surprise that one of the bigger clubs came in for him on the back of his performances for Swansea - the only surprise has been that he didn’t enjoy the success with Manchester City that we all thought he would.” Bony was set to play his first game for Stoke this afternoon in a behind closed doors friendly against Birmingham at the Potters' training ground. 13.08: BREAKING NEWS! It’s lunchtime and that can only mean one thing. Arsene Wenger has refused to pay the asking price for a Greggs Meal Deal. More as we get it. 13.06: WOLVES hope to complete a double swoop today with Monaco forward Ivan Cavaleiro in their sights - and former defender Richard Stearman already re-signed, writes Graham Hill. Portugal winger Cavaleiro is preparing to come to Molineux on a big-money permanent deal. It will be another move brokered by super agent Jorge Mendes who has been helping new Chinese owners Fosun build a squad capable of winning promotion. Stearman, 29, amazingly rejoins the club he left almost a year ago to the day. Wolves sold him to Fulham for £2m last season. Stearman has fallen out of favour at Craven Cottage and fits the bill for Wolves who have been chasing an experienced centre half. But it's a u-turn from a year ago when Stearman was sold for 'footballing reasons’. 13.03: If ever a player was born to play for Stoke, it's big bad Bony.

The Barcelona B kid failed to make a Premier start for Villa and is currently costing the club an eye-watering £2.34million per hour of first team action! 12.56: Don't tell us. 84 year old Charlie Adams has moved to that nice care home down the road?Be prepared, we have an announcement #SCFC pic.twitter.com/9Mn1O2CLnX— Stoke City FC (@stokecity) August 31, 201612.53: Attention, fans of Championship clubs!

We're negotiating with the player and Man City and trying to close the deal.” It all sounds promising but just wait until the medical reveals that Sami’s blood type is Dolmio. 12.42: Only another ten hours and 12 minutes before a desperate Saido Berahino is spotted walking around wearing a sandwich board advertising his services. 12.37: Celtic are still trying to sign Everton's James McCarthy on loan. 33 Edge of the seat stuff, this Deadline Day 12.34: Ronald Koeman is still trying to bring in a back-up keeper to Maarten Stekelenberg, writes PHIL THOMAS.The Everton manager had scouts at half a dozen grounds around Europe last weekend, after opting not to move for Joe Hart.Koeman sees fellow Dutchman Stekelenberg as his clear first choice stopper this season. But he wants a senior player to come in as number two, as he doesn’t feel Joel Robles is up to that level.Robles didn’t even get a game in last week’s League Cup romp against Yeovil, and will not feature unless there are injuries. Yet Koeman will only let the Spaniard leave if he does sign another keeper – and so far he has made little progress.SIGNING | Experienced goalkeeper Lee Grant joins #SCFC on loan until January from @dcfcofficial pic.twitter.com/yEyhH4OnbO— Stoke City FC (@stokecity) August 31, 201612.24: Stoke fans! We have HUGE news.... 12.20: Middlesbrough midfielder Albert Adomah is at Aston Villa’s training ground having a medical, ahead of an imminent move.

He was supposed to be sleeping - and I was just so frightened…,” she saidShe found him sitting up in his bed staring wide-eyed, his bloodshot eyes looking into the distance as his glowing iPad lay next to him.He seemed to be in a trance. Beside herself with panic, the mum had to shake the boy repeatedly to snap him out of it.Distraught, she could not understand how her once-healthy and happy little boy had become so addicted to the game that he wound up in a catatonic stupor.RELATED STORIES'I'm traumatised' Mummy blogger has to tell her son, nine, about the birds and the bees after he hears her having sex Rattle Ticket ‘I won my baby in a prize draw’: Woman bagged IVF treatment worth over £10,000  Prankster mum dresses up her child as she sleeps - and it's hilariously adorable RevealedKEEPING YOUR KIDS SAFE Here's what you need to know about baby car seats and the law Mini Miracle Mum of premature baby born weighing same as a jar of MARMITE documents girl's fight for life on Instagram Nicholas points out many kids have “aggressive temper tantrums” when their tech is taken away, and seen bored and have no interest in life without it.In fact, things like iPads and smart phones effect the brain in the same way as drugs do.This is why Dr. Peter Whybrow, Director of Neuroscience at UCLA calls screens “electronic cocaine” and Chinese researchers call them “digital heroin”. Nicholas has worked with over 1,000 teens over the last 15 years and says prevention is better than cure when it comes to tech addiction.In 2013, the American Academy of Pediatrics stated eight to 10-year-olds spent about eight hours A DAY using digital media, with that rising to 11 hours among teens.One in three kids are using tablets or smartphones before they can talk. Getty Images4 Having dinner with your children without any tech is a good ideaNicholas explains that once a person crosses over the line into full-blown addiction - drug, digital or otherwise - they need to detox before any other kind of therapy can have any chance of being effective.“With tech, that means a full digital detox - no computers, no smartphones, no tablets,"" he said.“The extreme digital detox even eliminates television. The prescribed amount of time is four to six weeks.”This is why it’s so important to stop your kid getting addicted in the first place. Nicolas suggests:Give them books not iPads and Lego rather than MinecraftEncourage them to play sports rather than watch TVTell their school not to give them access until they're 10Talk to your child about the risks of too much screen timeEat dinner at a table with no devices presentMake sure they have meaningful relationships - kids who feel connected to their families are less likely to need a digital fantasy worldSusan took away John's tablet, and after a long battle he's now using computers in a healthy way.Nicholas is the author of Glow Kids: How Screen Addiction is Hijacking Our Kids—and How to Break the Trance.

They say they want him to face execution.""It is not super important to me what his mindset was,"" John Stevens IV told the South Florida Sun Sentinel.""I just want to see the prosecutor ask for the death penalty.

This isn’t something that has been dreamed up on the back of a fag packet.“It’s the product of very long-term planning.”Everyone connected with Team GB acknowledges that none of this would have been possible without the £347million worth of funding they have received from the  National Lottery over the past four years.5 Pete Reed, Helen Glover, Max Whitlock, Nicola Adams and Katie Archibald travel home in a style of their own after their rampant Rio medal-winningPA:Press Association5 Katherine Grainger poses with her record-making Olympic silver medalOne Chinese reporter at the Heathrow Sofitel suggested that Britain had only been able to finish above a nation of 1.2 billion people by financially overwhelming their sporting rivals. Sweeney, though, was having none of that.He blasted: “China won’t tell us how much they spend but I would think there’s quite a lot of money in their system and I’d be surprised if we actually outspent them.”No one is in a better position  to judge the effect of the Lottery millions than Katherine  Grainger, who has now won medals at the last five Games.The record-breaking rower added another silver to her collection from the women’s double sculls, alongside Vicky Thornley.5 British athletes make their arrival selfie time after a momentous summerShe said: “I came into the  Olympics when the National Lottery came on board and I have really seen the team develop and flourish in the last 20 years. We are so  well prepared these days, with inspirational leaders who make the path much clearer to prepare for and deliver big results.“We had a lot of first-timers  in the Rio Games but they know  if they are wearing a GB vest, they are already part of a really strong brand and people look to you to deliver success.“We all thought London 2012 was a once-in-a-lifetime occasion that could never be replicated.“But when we were boarding  the plane in Rio the flight crew told us, ‘You have no idea what you’re about to walk into’.  The reception at Heathrow alone has been phenomenal.RELATED STORIESRevealedAhead of the Games Team GB enjoyed record haul but which country tops the rankings on medals per head of population?

The good thing about sport is that it does unite people. For a short while at least, we’ve had a lot of positive news stories.”Yet every silver cloud has a dark lining and it was almost inevitable that the consistent failure of the England football team would raise its ugly head.But former Sports Minister  Robertson was not about to enter that particular minefield.He said: “Today is all about reflecting on the success of Rio and celebrating the achievements of our athletes.“I can understand why you’ve asked but if we answer that  question that will be the headlines tomorrow. And we don’t want to go there.”No one does, Sir Hugh. But some of us have to . . ."

And a summer of change has left everyone wondering.Juventus — won the league and cup for a second season running — lost Paul Pogba, who return to Manchester United for a world-record £89million.Getty Images12 Juventus won the title for a fifth consecutive season in 2015-16Getty Images12 Juventus celebrates completing double with Coppa Italia victoryHowever, they have weakened their nearest rivals by splashing out on Gonzalo Higuain from Napoli and taking Miralem Pjanic from Roma.AC Milan was sold to Chinese investors for £628m and hired Vincenzo Montella as manager, while Frank de Boer — who won four titles in Holland with Ajax — replaced Roberto Mancini as boss of rivals, Inter.Neither giant has played Champions League football for three seasons now.Here are five questions ahead of the new Serie A season.Can anybody stop Juventus making history?Getty Images12 Max Allegri could make history with Juventus if they win a sixth-straight titleThe winners of the last five Serie A titles would make history with another win in 2016-17 — and they look a good bet.At a time when Italian football is in financial meltdown, Juve were able to take Napoli’s star and make him the third most expensive footballer of all time.Maurizio Sarri brought in highly-rated Polish forward, Arkadiusz Milik for £30m but looks set to lose defender Kalidou Koulibaly to Chelsea.Getty Images12 Francesco Totti will be hoping for a fairytale Scudetto to end careerLast season was a real missed opportunity for the Neapolitans. They were leading for the majority of the season after Juve’s horror star.But the Black and White juggernaut beat Napoli to overtake them in top spot and steamrolled over everyone on their way to a record extending 32nd league title.And Sarri’s men face losing their best players without bringing in top quality.Roma, meanwhile, added the likes of Gerson and Thomas Vermaelen.Pjanic will be a big loss, but wouldn’t it be fitting for Francesco Totti to win a second Scudetto before retiring?Can Gonzalo Higuain repeat heroics?Getty Images12 Gonzalo Higuain made history last season with his 36 Napoli goalsHiguain made history last season — his 36 league goals equalled the record set back in 1929.He didn’t score as many as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Luis Suarez and Cristiano Ronaldo, but, given the league he was playing in and team he was at, his was surely the best achievement.Higuain moved to Juve for £79m — but has faced questions over his weight.Getty Images12 There will be pressure on Gonzalo Higuain after his mega money move from NapoliHe will now be surrounded by more quality, and will be expected to fire the club to European glory.Has generally struggled on the biggest stage — with an important penalty miss in what was effectively a Champions League play-off against Lazio two seasons ago.And big chances squandered in Copa America and World Cup finals with Argentina.But his every game will be much more scrutinised now following his fee.And Higuain must prove he can deal with the pressure.Juve have lost Paul Pogba. Will they cope?Getty Images12 Paul Pogba was a vital member of Juventus' double-winning midfieldOver the last couple of seasons, the midfield which went toe-to-toe with Barcelona in the Champions League final has been decimated.Andrea Pirlo and Arturo Vidal both moved on — and now they’ve lost Pogba.Claudio Marchisio will still be an important member of the team, while a fit Sami Khedira would be an asset for any team.Getty Images12 Blaise Matuidi is Juventus' first choice replacement for Paul PogbaKwadwo Asamoah is back and fit after a serious injury, and Pjanic is a smart signing.Juve are in the market for a direct Pogba replacement, with Blaise Matuidi the favourite to come in.Related StoriesExclusiveREDS RAID Liverpool scout Leeds whizkid Leif Davis as backup for left-back Andy Robertson CITY TRICKERS Watch how City set up Prem trophy smash prank with jokers Aguero and KDB CECH MATE Cech will make decision on future after Europa League final despite Chelsea links WIL POWER Bournemouth eye £25m Liverpool ace Harry Wilson after impressing on loan at Derby Live BlogGUNNER sign?

The 24 year-old was so far ahead of the field that she finished almost 15 SECONDS of Kenyan Vivian Cheruiyot who had to settle for silver despite setting a national record. The first 13 finishers ran the fastest race of their life.SunSport understands there was concern that Ayana would not even race, having seemed ill in the call-room - the area where athletes are held before going out onto the track.Pavey, 42, who is competing at a record FIVE Games and clocked at season's best of 31:33.44, admitted: ""I found it tough out there.""You don't think the Chinese records will ever go. You don't always thing of them as records really.""I never thought that would happen. It was absolutely unbelievable.

But the 43-year-old retired in 1997 having never failed a drugs test.Ma himself has consistently denied using performance-enhancing drugs claiming the fast performances were down to the turtle blood and other natural Chinese remedies he gave to his athletes.Anyana, whose previous best was 30mins 7secs, described her achievement as a ""dream come true"".""I never thought that this would happen and I'm so in awe.""I'm very happy to get here.""Asked about doping, she added: ""My doping is my training.

Olivia Munn attends a Global Fan Screening of 'X-Men Apocalypse' at BFI IMAXLegions of lads have gone gaga for the 35-year-old, who is just as naughty off-screen as she is on it as the mind-reading bad girl in Marvel’s latest superhero blockbuster, out today.Olivia has posed for Playboy, is a fan of phone sex and once gamely dived into a gigantic cream pie while dressed as a French maid.But exactly who is this “GeekGoddess” who refuses to take herself too seriously?After getting her break as a presenter on Fox Sports in LA, she built a huge following hosting late-night videogame series Attack of the Show!, where she engaged in racy antics such as her pie stunt and suggestively munching on sausages.Her fans — the OMFG (Olivia Munn Fan Group) — loved that she was also a serious gamer and Star Wars superfan who once went to a comic convention dressed in Princess Leia’s gold bikini.Nothing seemed to be off-limits during her four-year stint on the show from 2006 — or after she left.In 2010 she released a racy book of essays called Suck It, Wonder Woman! — a New York Times bestseller — in which she shares her own brand of risque advice and recollections. She writes that “sex is natural and sex is good” and sets out a manifesto for being better in bed, including sexting a new partner and talking dirty early on in a relationship.In one chapter she advises: “Talking dirty is so important in sex. And it’s pretty easy. I think a simple text message from the beginning of the relationship is perfect. Forget everything you have seen in porn. Describe how it feels for you, how you want it to feel for her.”Another X-rated tip suggests how best to enjoy al fresco sex. She writes: “If you are driving by yourself and see a place in the road that looks great for f***ing — a clearing in the woods — remember it and then drive back by with her in the car.“Pretend like you just thought of it.”12 Film ... Olivia Munn, Oscar Isaac and Michael Fassbender in new X-Men film12 Catsuit ... Olivia Munn was picked to play villain Psylocke in X-Men: Apocalypse In the book Olivia also recalls, without a hint of shame, how she once got so drunk on tequila at a wedding in Mexico she had to be saved from drowning by her boyfriend after plunging into the sea fully clothed. The night ended with her getting intimate with a female member of the wedding party.She says: “I strip down and the maid of honour and I jump in the shower and warm up under the single showerhead. The next thing I know I’m kissing her with the water falling on top of us. I never, ever, ever kissed a girl or even came close to that. This was my first brush with a lesbian experience.”She also recounts a stomach-churning tale from her early days in Hollywood.While visiting a pal on a movie set Olivia found herself delivering lunch to the trailer of “a famous blockbuster director.” To her horror the man began to pleasure himself in front of her, all the while clutching the shrimp she brought him in his other hand.Olivia did little to quell her raunchy reputation when she was snapped in 2009 emerging from an LA sex shop clutching two boxes of condoms. At the time she was reportedly dating Star Trek actor Chris Pine, 35.However, for the past two years she has been in a relationship with Aaron Rodgers. The 32-year-old, the star quarterback for the Green Bay Packers NFL team, is one of the world’s highest-paid sports stars, and has a $110million five-year deal with his team.12 Host ... on late-night videogame series Attack of the Show!While starting a family is not in their plans yet, Olivia admitted freezing her eggs “years ago”.She said: “Every woman should know that there is this option and exercise it if they want to.”While comfortable courting controversy, Olivia has not always been happy to brush off criticism.Her cream-pie dive was slammed in some corners as “degrading”. Dessert-obsessed Olivia hit back saying it was empowering and even lifted up her shirt on TV to show how her love of sweet treats had left her unable to do up her jeans.She said of the pie stunt: “I’m proud of that moment. I’m proud young girls out there can see that a girl who has hips, a butt and some fat on her arms can get a chance to make it in Hollywood. I can have my pie and eat it, too — and then have some more when no one is looking.”After leaving Attack of the Show! she landed a coveted slot as a correspondent on popular US news satire programme The Daily Show.12 Diving ... Olivia loves pie12 Racy antics ... such as her giant cream pie stunt 12 Jumped ... sexy Olivia covered in cream Critics complained she was hired for her looks rather than her comic abilities. Defending herself she said: “I’m easy to hate. I get it. I know what it’s like to not think it’s fair for someone to look a certain way and also get their dream job.“But it is ridiculous to say a woman can’t be funny and also be sexy.”After landing bit-part acting roles in 2010 films Date Night and Iron Man 2,she starred in NBC sitcom Perfect Couples and heavyweight HBO political drama The Newsroom.12 Mouthful ... suggestively munching on sausagesProducer Jon Pollack, who worked with her on Perfect Couples, said: “What’s great about Olivia is she understands herself and just goes for it. She’s not self-conscious or afraid of being goofy, even though she’s obviously beautiful.”With more supporting roles to add to her CV, including in 2012’s Magic Mike, Olivia turned down being Ryan Reynolds’ love interest in Deadpool, another of this year’s Marvel films, as “she didn’t want to be the girlfriend again”.Even before signing up to X-Men: Apocalypse she wanted to ensure she had a fight scene and was not being used as “the eye candy”.She knows the Marvel Universe inside-out — nerdy knowledge that may have something to do with her upbringing.Her Chinese mother and American father split up when she was two and when her mum remarried — to a “horrible” US Air Force officer — Olivia and brother John “lived in hell” growing up in Japan, where their stepdad was stationed.12 Career ... actress Olivia wanted to ensure she had a fight scene and was not being used as 'the eye candy'They divorced when Olivia was 16 but she struggled to make friends when they moved back to the US.However, she found solace in one group, recalling: “Through every school, state and country, the one group of kids I could always count on to be sweet and welcoming and let me eat lunch with them was the geeks.”She later moved in with her grandparents while studying journalism at Oklahoma University. Tragically, Olivia saw her grandmother collapse and die in front of her and was plagued with guilt for snapping at her just hours earlier. Olivia also believes her turbulent upbringing helped forge a strong bond with her fans.But she joked that she probably disappointed them when she posed for Playboy in 2009, although she drew the line at going nude.12 Serious gamer ... Star Wars superfan who once went to a comic convention dressed in Princess Leia's gold bikini12 Posing ... Olivia was happy to do a Playboy spreadShe said: “It did mean something for me to be on the cover. I’m very open about the fact that it’s nice when someone says you’re pretty.“I have a vivid memory of my stepfather saying to my mum, “Olivia isn’t very pretty is she?’. I remember looking at myself in the mirror that night and hitting myself over and over.“It was the sort of childhood that makes you either desperate and suicidal or makes you see the humour in almost every situation.“I chose laughs.”12 All heart ...

Speed and risk. Economic risk.”Switching to Tarmac from track, it’s still all about faster and lighter with their brand new California — but little sign of financial risk.Despite the global recession last year, the Prancing Horse saw revenue exceed 2billion euros for the first time — 2.251bn to be exact — an increase of 17.3 per cent over 2010.In total Ferrari sold 7,195 cars in 2011, up around 14 per cent.This all-time high in sales was boosted by a record number of 1,958 US vehicles sold. Ferrari also had stronger than average sales in the Chinese market, selling a total of 777, a 63 per cent increase from the previous year.German sales were up roughly 14.5 percent, totalling 705. They also sold 574 cars in the UK, up an incredible 23 per cent.2Supercar-lite ... CaliforniaThe California was launched three years ago and is a major player in the current success story, but already this revised version has been unleashed — and an optional Handling Speciale pack.When it went on sale, the California swept in a number of uniques for Ferrari, including its first direct-injection V8 engine, first twin-clutch gearbox and first folding hardtop. Ferrari also said they wanted this Grand Tourer to attract a different kind of customer — a super-smooth supercar.That has definitely worked with 70 PER CENT of the 8,000 Californias sold going to new buyers to the brand. That now makes the California arguably the most important model they have.The Prancing purists are up in arms at this supercar-lite operator. Now they are aiming to satisfy the connoisseurs and to convert others with extra horsepower and handling pack.I was the first newspaper journalist to get behind the wheel of the new California on the mountains near Ferrari’s Maranello mecca and home. A new exhaust, and a host of under-bonnet tweaks have wrung out an extra 30bhp from the 4.3litre V8, taking the total to 483bhp and lowering the car’s 0-62mph time by a tenth, to 3.8 seconds.Laughably, it’s still termed the ‘slowest’ Ferrari, yet still tops out at a more than adequate 194mph.While it can’t match the 458’s mind-blowing acceleration, it’s very fast nonetheless, and the extra power adds pace throughout the rev range. more motors Road TestFastest Ferrari road car ever We review the Ferrari F12 Berlinetta from price to economy and all its features Road Testpure style and class We review the Aston Martin Vanquish Volante (2013) from price to economy and all its features Road TestGlamour and serious speed We review the Bentley Continental from price to economy and all its features Road Testelectrifying performance We review the Aston Martin V12 Vantage S (2013) from price to economy and all its features Road Testextreme & exciting We review the Lamborghini Aventador Superveloce from price to economy and all its features  But you’d need to be Fernando Alonso to notice any lack of ooomph.I dropped the roof and suddenly I was the conductor of the world’s fastest orchestra. My hands flicked on and off the F1-style gear-changing paddles behind the steering wheel.Those movements dictate the engine soundtrack. Flick down and it’s pure high-pitched strings, flick up, tap my feet and it’s greeted by a bellowing bassy wind section. This is the Royal Thrillarmonic.Ferrari have also slashed 30kg from the California’s weight, and although there are no efficiency gains, my car was fitted with stop-start which lowers CO2 emissions down to an impressive 270g/km. As previously, fuel consumption remains around 20mpg.They’re the only changes on the standard model, but for a bit more excitement you can pay £4,320 for the Handling Speciale pack, which is available for the first time.It adds zip through the driving experience with quicker steering and suspension tweaks to make it racier all round.If the standard car is Prince William, its brotherly Handling pack adds a bit more Prince Harry.The wilder side is immediately noticeable — the steering is far quicker to react and it’s a lot more fun and precise on twisty country roads.It certainly doesn’t measure up to the 458 Spider as out-and-out supercar experience, but neither is it designed for that. The California is a success for being a more versatile car — and Ferrari say that 20 per cent of owners drive it as an everyday car and it gets 50 per cent more road time than any of their other models.Now it’s an even more impressive all-rounder with the Handling Speciale pack potentially appeasing the purists.Price for the standard California is £156,406 — the pack takes it over £160k.There’s no stopping motoring’s biggest brand as it expands even further.For Ferrari it’s now all about trains, financial gains and automobiles."
