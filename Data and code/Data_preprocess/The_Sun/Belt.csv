9,"China is the powerhouse of the East’s relentless rise by ‘bribing, spending and stealing’  — are we in the midst of a new Cold War?",https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6534961/midst-of-a-cold-war-john-hemmings/,"15th June 2018, 1:58 am","THE news that a former Rolls-Royce engineer has been held on suspicion of spying for China on Britain’s new stealth fighter sounds like the stuff of the Cold War.But to those of us who know the country well, if true, it would come as little surprise.Getty - Contributor3 The success of China's economy could be a result of the foreign development aid and investment it has received, writes Dr John HemmingsWe are already in the midst of a new Cold War, but one that takes place quietly yet systematically all around us. China has risen from its economic and technological doldrums of the late 20th century with dizzying speed and is now steaming ahead on course to overtake the US as the world’s largest economy.And the fear is that, to achieve this, it is buying, bribing, investing in or simply nicking any and all the clever ideas it needs from the West. While China’s success offers opportunities for us in terms of trade, it is also a threat as they seem to want to plunder our research and development for intellectual property (IP), important both to our national security and our jobs.GCHQ estimates that China has an army of 30,000 experts spying on foreign companies, with more than 60 per cent of the FTSE compromised by Chinese intelligence. The costs are significant. According to a US study, China’s theft of American IP costs jobs and between $225billion and $600billion (£170billion and £450billion) annually. We don’t know how much they might have cost Britain, because we haven’t done the numbers.How did we get here? How did China go from a wrecked agricultural, heavy-industry Marxist economy in the late Seventies to the powerhouse it is today? It was a mixture of hard work and opening up to the world, through the reforms of leader Deng Xiaoping. But it was also down to a lot of foreign development aid and investment, principally from the US, but also from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and the EU.Getty - Contributor3 There could be more than 30,000 Chinese spies within foreign companies across the globeBusiness was good as trillions of dollars flowed into an economy just recovering from the Cultural Revolution. But behind the business handshakes and shiny new projects, China’s military leaders were planning how they could catch up with the West and surpass it. And it all began in Iraq, oddly enough. Those who remember the first Iraq War of 1991 will recall how worried Western leaders were sending troops into Iraq.After all, it had one of the largest armies in the world, equipped and trained by the Soviet Union. Indeed, many watched the war to see who would win as a test-case of technology. But US and coalition forces demolished the Iraq military within six weeks, using laser-guided bombs and missiles with other computer-led technologies.And in Beijing, there was stone-cold shock as they watched Iraq’s army — one nearly identical in training, doctrine and equipment to its own — melt away. In a bid to understand how the Iraqis could lose so badly, Chinese military colonels Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui, wrote the book Unrestricted Warfare, which decided how China would attempt to fight such high-tech weapons — and how they should steal those same technologies.Then a Congressional study in the US alleged that the Chinese government was attempting to buy American military firms specialising in these technologies using fake “zombie” companies: Old US firms that had gone broke and been bought as “fronts”. The Cox Report, as it was known, made little impact on the pro-China approach adopted by the Bill Clinton administration of the time.3 China's economy is predicted to surpass that of the USFor many, the 1990s and 2000s were about doing business, not talking about spying between old Cold War enemies.The September 11 attacks only made that trend stronger as Islamic terrorism became the West’s primary adversary. In the meantime, government-backed Chinese students began flooding into British, Canadian and US research universities, picking up as much knowledge as they could on aerospace engineering and information technologies.China has also established investment consortiums to go into high-tech hubs in Cambridge and Shoreditch and hoover up British start-ups before they even reach the open market. Its huge road, rail and seaport initiative, One Belt One Road, is an extraordinary bid to create routes better connecting China to the rest of world, with a potential price tag exceeding £6TRILLION. Their ambition apparently knows no bounds.China is already on course to overtake the US as the world’s largest economy in 2029. Many analysts believe they are seeking to emulate the British Empire in terms of power and influence.Despite the many business groups that lobby on behalf of China in Britain, the May government has sought to slowly restrict sensitive sectors of Chinese investment. Last year, think tank the Henry Jackson Society published a report on Chinese investment into sensitive parts of UK infrastructure, noting how Germany, Australia, Canada and the US were beginning to restrict Chinese investment in parts of their economies.MOST READ IN OPINIONCommentJANE MOORE Time for something completely different…let's put the boot in at EU elections CommentALLY ROSS Graham Norton shouldn't have spared Madge's blushes as he lashed Eurovision acts CommentDAMIAN GREEN How Tory leadership race can lead to every Brit having a shot at the good life CommentTHE SUN SAYS Hipster who threw MILKSHAKE achieved nothing but to recruit more Farage fans CommentTREVOR KAVANAGH Vote for Nigel Farage's Brexit Party this week before BoJo zips into No10 CommentNICK TIMOTHY Tinderbox Tories will get burned at the ballots - they need a new plan Despite this, China has several key members of the establishment on its side. Even David Cameron is involved in a billion-dollar investment fund to boost trade links with Beijing to the alarm of some of his friends.For its part, the May government has done an excellent job reforming the previous checks on malicious investment, but it must decide with its other “Five Eye” intelligence allies (Canada, the US, Australia and New Zealand) which parts of the economy are open to investment and which parts are off-limits.Dr Hemmings is Director of the Asia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson SocietyChina strongly opposes US warships sailing  into disputed waters near Xisha Islands "
10,Has Trump pulled off the greatest diplomatic feat of the 21st century by brokering peace on the Korean peninsula?,https://www.thesun.co.uk/https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6160282/has-trump-pulled-off-the-greatest-diplomatic-feat-of-the-21st-century-by-brokering-peace-on-the-korean-peninsula/,"27th April 2018, 5:52 pm","Whatever you think of Donald Trump – you have to admit it’s been a great week for him.He’s had a successful state visit from the French president, received a viral celebrity endorsement from rapper Kanye West, and finally confirmed his long overdue visit to Great Britain.EPA8 America is thought to be behind the peace talks happening in KoreaOh, and he may have just pulled off the greatest diplomatic feat of the 21st century by securing peace on the Korean peninsula.Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in, the leaders of the North and South Korea, today signed an agreement pledging ""no more war"" and ""complete denuclearisation.""It’s hard to exaggerate what big news this is. Arguably the most rogue nation on earth has started to play nice on the global stage. As Kim Jong-un himself says, ""a new history begins now.""And why? The answer is Donald J Trump.If this peace holds, America’s leader will finally have ended the cold war – bringing in the last fully Communist country in from the cold. People used to joke about Trump winning the Noble Peace Prize.Now, it seems, he really should be considered. After all Obama was given one in 2009, when all he’d ever done was make pretty speeches.AP:Associated Press8 Kanye West took to Twitter to share his love for TrumpEPA8 Today the leaders of North and South Korea committed to building peace between their nationsIt’s not just Obama. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush also tried to bring Pyongyang in from the cold, and fell short because they weren’t willing to risk a showdown with not just North Korea, but China – North Korea’s one treaty ally.By contrast, Trump, who sees himself as the anti-Obama, wasted no time in grasping the North Korean nettle.Very early in his presidency, he began tweeting that he would not hesitate to take military action against Kim.Later, he told reporters that he would not hesitate in bringing down ‘fire and fury’ – all America’s enormous military might -- on North Korea.And whenever anyone thought he might be easing up on the war talk, he would take to Twitter again.This drove the mainstream (ie anti-Trump media) mad.President Donald Trump says the US is 'not going to be played' when it comes to peace talks with North KoreaAFP or licensors8 Trump has had a successful week with celebrity endorsements, peace in Korea and a UK visit confirmedAP:Associated Press8 Kim Jong-un is the first North Korean leader to cross the boarder into the south in 56 yearsEverybody thought Trump was a lunatic – a hothead who could trigger nuclear apocalypse. He even started bragging about how his red button was bigger than Kim’s.This seemed to be the Trump that everyone dreaded. An impatient bully who would end up triggering a nuclear apocalypse just because he wanted to look tough.But what only the most loyal Trump aides realised is that he knew exactly what he was doing.He was making his diplomatic adversaries believe that he was so crazy he could do anything — when former President Richard Nixon did this against the Communist Bloc, it was called the ‘mad man theory.’Trump has used social media to give that same tactic a new edge. He's effectively trolled world powers into bending to his will.As well as the Twitter bluster towards Kim, Trump pursued a more conventional strategy to force Kim to the peace table. He forced new sanctions on North Korea imports that quickly started to bite.EPA8 The two Koreas have been in a stalemate for nearly 65 yearsNorth Korea's economy, like that of most badly run autocracies is highly fragile, so any punitive actions by outside states can really hurt.Trump upped the ante on China, too. He urged them to step as a regional superpower and force their naughty friend Kim to behave himself.China had hitherto avoided joining in international sanctions on its ally: their calculation was that America would never actually go to war to force North Korea to give up its WMD-oreintated ambitions. With Trump in charge, they couldn’t be so sure.Trump has given Beijing a headache on another front, too. He’s begun waging a trade war on China’s steel and aluminium exports into the US — a move that again seems insane, given that it could plummet the global economy.Rex Features8 Trumps tactics to handle the Korea problem included tweeting threats of warAgain, Trump’s move was not as silly as it looked. China knows that it has even more to lose from a trade stand-off with Trump than America does.This gave China another impetus to throw Trump a large diplomatic bone over North Korea instead. So Beijing pushed Kim to the negotiating table to appease Trump.The North and South Korea summit must be good news for anyone who doesn’t want the world to end. But for Trump, who loves a great photo-op, it will be all about his big rendezvous with Kim later this year.Having (we all hope) secured a peace deal, he’ll be able to pose as world saviour — a man who risked everything to stop a nuclear war. It will be cheesy as hell, and he’ll be in seventh heaven.AP:Associated Press8 The peace talks are a historic achievement for Trump and the leaders of South and North KoreaThe great dealmaker strikes again. What Obama would have given to have pulled this off, he'll be thinking. (He always thinks about Obama).But is Trump manipulating Pyongyang and Beijing? Or vice-versa?Perhaps Kim and China have realised that, when dealing with a egomaniac like Trump, all you have to do is make him feel great — and a sense that he has changed the course history, and will be happy.most read in opinonCommentJANE MOORE Time for something completely different…let's put the boot in at EU elections CommentALLY ROSS Graham Norton shouldn't have spared Madge's blushes as he lashed Eurovision acts CommentDAMIAN GREEN How Tory leadership race can lead to every Brit having a shot at the good life CommentTHE SUN SAYS Hipster who threw MILKSHAKE achieved nothing but to recruit more Farage fans CommentTREVOR KAVANAGH Vote for Nigel Farage's Brexit Party this week before BoJo zips into No10 CommentNICK TIMOTHY Tinderbox Tories will get burned at the ballots - they need a new plan But Kim won’t stop being a dictator; he’ll just play a bit nicer on the international stage. Will he actually give up his WMDs? Or just appear to do so until the sanctions drop?Meanwhile China — the real threat to America’s status as top dog — can carry on quietly building its economic and military power.It emerged this week that China is willing employ troops to protect its enormous 'one belt one road' expansion into Pakistan. For Beijing, that project has more importance than their troublesome friend in Pyongyang.But that’s all to be revealed. For now, we can only stand back and admit it: Trump’s crazy Twitter diplomacy seems to have paid off, as Trump might say, hugely.Freddie Gray is Deputy and USA editor of The SpectatorSouth Korean President Moon arrives in Panmunjom for historic summit with North Korea leader Kim Jong-un "

He said: “I will give full support to the Prime Minister as long as she wants to lead my party.“I think she is doing an excellent job and I do wish more of my party colleagues have seen the sort of leadership and commitment and positive agenda that’s been projected for Britain here in China.”He added: “Maybe they should see the PM’s performance in selling Britain overseas.“That might do everybody a lot of good.""I’m not here to focus on internal Conservative party politics.

That's rare in our history.""Xi also managed to get at least two of his cherished programmes written into the constitution: an anti-corruption campaign that has brought down 1.5 million crooked officials since 2012 and the Belt and Road initiative, the massive global trade infrastructure project intended to increase China's influence abroad.The congress declared the Communist Party China's ""absolute leader"", a clear sign that it intends to further tighten its grip on the country.""Those who approve, raise your hands,"" Xi said during the vote as a flurry of arms shot up in unison.CHINA'S RED FATHERMao Zedong was a Chinese communist leader and founder of the People's Republic of China.Though still celebrated in China, he was responsible for the disastrous policies of the ""Great Leap Forward"" and the ""Cultural Revolution"".He was born into a peasant family in December 1893 in Shaoshan, in Hunan province, central China.Mao trained as a teacher and became a Marxist when he took a university library job in Beijing.He founded the Chinese Communist Party in 1921 and led it to victory in the Chinese Civil War after World War Two.He proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 and imposed strict communist policies, ruthlessly crushing any opposition.In 1958 Mao launched the ""Great Leap Forward"", an attempt to increase agricultural and industrial production that backfired horribly, leading to famine and millions of deaths.In 1966, in an attempt to re-stablish his authority, he oversaw the ""Cultural Revolution"" - an attempt to rid the country of capitalism and other counter-communist elements.The purges and upheaval that followed once again crippled the country and devastated the country's historical heritage.In the 1970s he tried to restore relationships with the US, Japan and Europe but died in 1976.When he asked if anyone was not in favour, shouts of ""None!"" echoed in the imposing Great Hall of the People in Beijing.""Now our country is unified, cohesive, and moving up in the world,"" northeast Jilin province delegate Li Hualiang told AFP.The congress also elected a new 204-member Central Committee, which included just 10 women.Xi is expected to secure a second five-year term as general secretary of the party and could also consolidate his power by filling the standing committee with allies.A vast security apparatus was thrown around the congress, with businesses ranging from nightclubs to gyms closing to avoid any incidents and factories shuttered in what turned out to be a failed attempt to clear the city's notorious smog.Xi has sought to portray himself as a responsible global leader while US President Donald Trump trumpets a nationalist ""America First"" policy and the European Union grapples with Britain's exit.His blueprint foresees no change in the single-party political system, and gives no sign that crackdowns on human rights activists will ease.Some of his goals, such as building a modern military by 2035, go beyond the end of his second term, a hint that he foresees himself staying at the centre of China's political life for years to come.most read in world newsZAPPED TO DEATH Toddler killed after putting phone charger in mouth while plugged into wall ‘HEINOUS ABUSE’ Girl, 3, dies after being 'raped and battered by stepdad while mum watched' MIRACLE TOT Toddler, 3, survives plunging 30ft and being impaled on 6ft-long rod SEALED FOR ETERNITY 1,000-year-old Buddha statue contains skeleton of 'self-mummified' monk LIT FUSE Sick moment Russian thug punches woman in the face and knocks her out outside club 'I WANTED TO GET RID OF HER' Mum, 21, abandoned daughter, 2, to ‘spend time with boyfriend' We pay for your stories!

China has already pledged more than $100 billion and it will be completed in a series of bilateral projects — such as the $46 billion China-Pakistan economic corridor, or a $5.2 billion railway that will eventually link Laos, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.The Chinese Embassy said the “overall vision” is to build a “road of peace, prosperity, opening up, innovation and civilization” that is open for collaboration with other countries. It’s inspired by the ancient Sik Road, it said and over the next five years, China will spend up to $1 trillion in participating countries.AP6 This installation of a 'Golden Bridge of Silk Road' in Beijing was added ahead of a global summit on the project in May this yearGetty Images6 President Xi Jinping announced the plans earlier this year6The enormous venture has been called the “biggest story” in Asian business that could redefine global trade.Combined with US President Trump’s decision to pull out of the trans-Pacific Partnership, some suggest it could signal the start of China becoming the leader on globalised exports.SOAS China Institute expert Dr Yuka Kobayashi said while Chinese President Xi Jinping’s 2013 speech on the plan has seen it hyped as a “new strategy”, it’s actually a “continuation” of an old idea to assert Chinese political and economic power.“The initiative is a complex one,” she told news.com.au.MOST READ IN WORLD NEWSZAPPED TO DEATH Toddler killed after putting phone charger in mouth while plugged into wall ‘HEINOUS ABUSE’ Girl, 3, dies after being 'raped and battered by stepdad while mum watched' MIRACLE TOT Toddler, 3, survives plunging 30ft and being impaled on 6ft-long rod LIT FUSE Sick moment Russian thug punches woman in the face and knocks her out outside club SEALED FOR ETERNITY 1,000-year-old Buddha statue contains skeleton of 'self-mummified' monk 'I WANTED TO GET RID OF HER' Mum, 21, abandoned daughter, 2, to ‘spend time with boyfriend' WILLY RIDDLE Man wakes up from boozy night out to find penis cut off and has no idea how BABY’S DRUG NIGHTMARE Baby in coma with cocaine and cannabis in system as mum arrested WarningFREAK BLAST HORROR Patient's head explodes as 'stomach gas ignites' during emergency op REIGN OF TERROR Monster couple forced autistic woman, 22, to EAT dead mum's ashes “It encompasses areas of security and economics and is also China’s challenge to US hegemony.It’s part and parcel of China trying to assert itself as a rising power and having this influence in power politics commensurate with their status.”She said the focus on economic is also part of China “trying to present itself in a palatable way” to others. “It’s presented as a win-win initiative, with fuzzy Confucian ideals so that is not perceived as threatening for these border regions.”China has touted the project as a way of connecting and developing some of the most diverse countries in the world, providing economic opportunities to left-behind regions.However it’s also widely seen as a way of creating markets for Chinese goods which helps solve the problem of overcapacity for China.Meanwhile strategic and geopolitical overtones reinforce its dominance in the region.Dr Kobayashi said the response from countries has been “mixed” depending on how much they need the investment.“Not being perceived as a ‘threat’ is something that the Chinese are very conscious about so they’re really trying to package it that way, saying ‘we’re investing in infrastructure’ giving you the financing and helping with construction. It’s hard to say ‘no’ to that,” she said.Others have been less diplomatic.China expert Tom Miller told the BBC parts of it could be described as a “giant bribe” in which China promises investment in exchange for political concessions.He also raised the prospect of poor countries like Laos being stripped of their natural resources in exchange for $7 billion in railway investment, for example.“How is Laos going to pay this back? In practice it’s going to pay it back with natural resources,” he said.“This railway could metaphorically become a conveyor belt for exporting valuable natural resources out of the country to China.”Getty Images6 A train route connecting China and East London was successfully used for the first time this yearIndia has also raised fears China’s military ports — dubbed a “string of pearls” — could “prove costly for India at the time of conflict with China”.China maintains that it is full of “peace loving people” and their growth is a “contribution to world peace and prosperity,” a spokeswoman for the Chinese embassy said.“With a population of more than 1.3 billion, China is still the biggest developing country in the world seeking to balance the level of development within the country.”The project is already being praised in Serbia where China has loaned the country $8 billion to build bridges, highways and roads to bring goods into Europe.Earlier this year, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban also said the “old model for globalisation has become obsolete” and the East was the new “engine room” for global growth.Despite the enthusiasm, Dr Kobayashi said it’s important to question how “realistic” and “economically viable” the plan is, given the potential for “sensationalist” figures.“It’s a good niche on financing in infrastructure they’ve focused on and they have presented this in a palatable manner.However in terms of the scale of the initiative there are doubts about how realistic it is,“Also on the win-win the Chinese emphasise, there are doubts. Is it really win-win for trains to take manufactured products from China to Madrid and go back empty?”We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

I passed the theory first time. I booked the test so soon after my theory.""I took a couple of lessons so I knew what the instructors were looking for, but it turned out to be a nightmare.""The first time I failed, it was for cutting someone up at a roundabout and then jumping the lights.""The second one, I kept it all squeaky clean and I was on for a good one when I came to a roundabout by the test centre.Getty Images6 Jolyon Palmer passed his driving test... but only at the third attempt""He was indicating to come off, so I went, but then he changed his mind and drove straight on and gave me a hoot, so I was pretty fuming at that. I passed the third one easily.""Palmer is not like your average F1 driver. He is refreshingly relaxed and remains down to earth.He still enjoys watching local team Crystal Palace - although he supports Ipswich - and playing five-a-side with his mates before a night down the pub.Splash News6 Palmer has a normal lifestyle when he is away from the spotlight of glamorous F1There are no expensive motorcars in his garage, just a £7,000 two-seater electric Renault Twizy that can do 50mph, just, and a Megane, his other company car.In fact, Palmer has never bought a car and retells a story about his first shunt while driving.He added: ""My first car was an Audi A3 1.6 litre and it got written off when someone drove into it while travelling on the wrong side of the road.""I was driving around a blind bend and then an elderly couple came round the corner on my side of the road. They thought it was a dual carriageway.""They were nonchalantly driving along and the drove straight into me head-on and wrote my car off. I was only 19 and since then I have never owned a car.""Palmer's first season in F1 was just as nervy as coming face to face with a car travelling in the wrong direction.EPA6 Renault starlet Palmer hopes to build on his promising 2016, starting Down UnderAfter his performance in Melbourne last season, he was already facing questions about whether he would be ditched by Renault for 2017.He admits the talk about his future was a distraction. He had dreamed about driving in F1 as a child yet it looked over after only one crack, the insurance policy of a degree in business looked like a wise decision after all.However, the 26-year-old was re-signed for another season by the French car giant and now Palmer is hoping he will finally get the chance to show what he can do.He said: ""You benefit from the experience. In my career, second-season syndrome has always been a positive thing.""You can have some ups and downs in the first year and you learn all your lessons and then the second year, you start from fresh.EPA6 Palmer knows his career is on the up but he remains down to earth""I hope that I can become a more rounded driver this year.""Australia was so good last year and then in Bahrain and China, I did not have the car where I wanted it and did not have the experience to describe how I wanted the car to go.""If you've not got confidence in what is beneath you, then you start chasing your tail and the result will be bad.""Once the results are bad, the pressure goes up and the rumours started up, and it was difficult.""But after crashing out at Monaco I had a reset and cleared my head out and told myself to get on with the job.""I was gutted after Monaco and not in a good place mentally.

To constantly be in the points and then, when the opportunity comes, be ready to take a podium."" With Jenson Button's retirement, Palmer is one of two Brits on the grid and stands alongside Lewis Hamilton.However, with the Monaco-resident Hamilton splitting opinions in the UK, Palmer is hoping to have the full support of the nation and says he is ready to carry the country's hopes.Rex Features6 Palmer shuns the world of expensive cars when he is away from the F1 gridHe added: ""It would be a privilege to be one of only two British drivers on the grid. I would love to help the British fans have a good weekend, if I could have a strong race.""There is pressure from that but then it comes from being in F1, it is just about being in a right place mentally.""But I think that given the car is going to be better this year, and that I have a year of experience under my belt, I am going to be in a much better position."""

Huffman was simply investigating the receptors in the human brain that responded to ­tetrahydrocannabinol, the key ­ingredient in cannabis.He made synthetic compounds and wrote detailed research papers to ensure he received further grants for his work. Huffman named each one with his own initials JWH.www.kobal-collection.com10 The scene could be straight out of Shaun of the Dead but it's actually drug-inducedHe claims he was “experimenting for good” but now recognises the deadly danger of Spice and wants it banned globally — but wrongly, in my view, believes cannabis should be legal.Spice was made illegal in the UK last year but there have only been 72 prosecutions with 332 shops banned from selling it and 31 shops closed down.It has not halted the trade, with the Sunday Times finding more than 40 websites offering ­different forms of the drug including one prepared to sell £80,000-worth without a check.Asked if he had tried the drug, Huffman replied: “Lord, no.”MOST READ IN NEWSDYING WISH Single mum loses fight with cancer after asking family 'Look after my boys' ExclusiveROO'S FURY Wayne Rooney livid after bro filmed looking pally in pub loo with Tommy Robinson ZAPPED TO DEATH Toddler killed after putting phone charger in mouth while plugged into wall 'RAPE' RAP Oritse Williams' manager admits touching 'zombified' girl as 'star raped her' WarningMOB JUSTICE Furious crowds strip female ‘shoplifters’ naked, batter them and cut their hair COT CLOTS Celebs' pics of babies sleeping in unsafe conditions 'fuelling cot death rise' Spice is rampant in our jails and, with the ease with which it can now be manufactured, is likely to create more addicts on our streets.I know our politicians are taking this threat seriously but there are always siren voices explaining why the liberal view is best.To those people can I suggest they look at the photo of the young man in Manchester and ask: Would you like one of your children reduced to a zombie?I think I know the answer already.

Like you, I have been told council tax bills MUST rise next month to deal with the cost of social care for the elderly.Fair enough.What nobody told me was that councillors round my way (and possibly round yours) were going to take advantage of the hike to award themselves 12.4 per cent pay rises from May while pegging council staff to just two per cent.What made it even more outrageous was my council Elmbridge – it covers snooty Weybridge, Esher and Walton on Thames in Surrey – is controlled by residents’ associations and Lib Dims.They sell themselves as representatives of ordinary people, not fat cats exploiting their position.Clearly that script will have to be rewritten.Alamy10 But it's frustrating to see my local councillors give themselves a pay rise out of the moneyTo give them credit, the Conservative opposition were horrified and voted against the rise of £547 to £4,942. And so much for pretending to worry about the old dears in the area as the councillors have raised the price of day centre meals by six per cent.Having stood twice as an independent – and been rejected twice – I know some of the characters with their noses in the trough and have even contributed heavily to the election expenses of a couple of them.

But this year the forecast is a £4million loss, with that figure doubling to £8million in 2018 because advertising in print is forecast to continue its downward spiral.With no cover price – the Standard is free – the slightest of movements in advertising has a horrendous effect on the annual profit and loss statement. And that’s where Osbo comes in.It’s not his skill in journalism (he hasn’t any) nor having mates at the top table (he no longer has any) that made him a shoo-in for the job, but the fact that as Chancellor he was used to looking at mammoth losses all day long – and blaming somebody else for them.A perfect CV for being editor of the Standard.As with his old job it will, I confidently predict, end in tears. Night Nightly ShowRex Features10 The Nightly Show's poor performance is bringing down ITV's day viewing figures tooGET ready to say night night to ITV’s p**s-poor Nightly Show.It hit rock bottom with Davina McCall bringing in just 990,000 ­saddos but had one other strange effect – it reduced the ­audience of the network’s breakfast show Good Morning Britain some nine hours later.An insider tells me that with viewers seeking news at 10pm and ITV giving them tosh, instead they’re switching to the BBC and then ­toddle off to bed leaving the set tuned to the Beeb.So in the morning the ­audience can’t be bothered to switch over, stay with the BBC and damage ITV’s daytime figures.Genius, pure genius. The Effing Sandwich Shop10 This punny sandwich shop made me chuckleCAFE in Effingham Road, Sheffield – Effing Sandwich Shop.Plumber’s van in Spain – Tubbs, Boggs And Boyler.Window cleaners in­ ­Haywards Heath, West Sussex – A Glass Act.Sports massage firm in Wigan – Knot A Problem.On the back of a safari bus in South Africa – Dung Beetles Really Know Their S**t.Fish merchants in Farnborough, Hants – Offish Supplies.Plumbing firm in Chingford, Essex – The Great Drain Robbers.Carpenters in Brighton, East Sussex – Wooden It Be Nice.Chinese in Romford, Essex – Ho Lee Fook.Another Chinese in Burnage, Manchester – Wok And Roll.Hairdressers in Wigan – Style Council.Love the punnies.

But I felt so claustrophobic I shuddered as we boarded the cramped Vietnam Airlines plane. “Can’t we take a car instead?” I asked Pasje [her fiance].“The jungle is very dense, and the road is horrible,” he replied. “It would take days. By the time we get there, we would have to leave again.”CNN4 She managed to keep herself alive by squeezing rainwater collected in sponges ripped from the insulation of the wrecked planeI sat down nervously. Fifty excruciating minutes later we experienced a tremendous drop, and Pasje looked at me with fear. “Of course, a s***ty little toy plane drops like this!”""I said, reaching for his hand. “It’s just an air pocket — don’t worry.”""It went pitch-black. Seconds later, we made impact.""I don’t remember exactly what happened, but I guess I tumbled around in the cabin like a lonely piece of laundry in a clothes dryer, hitting my head and limbs against the ceiling and lockers.""I may have been the only one not wearing a seat belt.""At some point I must have landed and slipped under a seat, legs first, and gotten stuck.

A Chinese H-6K bomber patrols the disputed islands in the South China SeaA ""rapid deployment"" exercise yesterday saw bombers, fighters and supporting aircraft surge past the Philippines and Taiwan

be responding in kind.News reports out of India say Washington and New Delhi will soon be engaging in joint army exercises barely 100km from India’s border with China.Alamy5 Chinese jets will be performing exercises with their Russian counterparts in a series of war gamesBeijing has laid claim to the bulk of the South China Sea, despite competing claims from adjoining nations including Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.It has also been aggressively promoting a “One Belt, One Road” initiative, which sees the restoration of ancient “Silk Road” trade routes with the Middle East via Pakistan and the Indian Ocean.The eight day naval drill kicked off Monday in the South China Sea off China’s Guangdong province.Alamy5 Planes like the H-6K bomber will join Russian
