Instead, cross-strait relations have deteriorated.“Second, as one generation of Taiwanese replaces another, the ‘Chinese’ identity among the people will only grow weaker.“Third, the influence of Taiwan’s political parties is waning. Even if the Kuomintang wins back power, it would not be in a position to lead cross-strait unification.“Fourth, more and more Chinese people are calling for unification by force.”  GOOGLEChina has always seen the Taiwan as a mutinous provinceA spotlight was shone on the tense relationship between China and Taiwan when Donald Trump enraged Beijing by speaking on the telephone to Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen shortly after his election victory in 2016.The controversial call was the first between the leader of the island and a US president since ties between America and Taiwan were severed in 1979 at Beijing’s request and Washington adopted its “one China” principle which officially considers the independently governed island part of the same single Chinese nation as the mainland.Mr Trump ruffled more feathers when he signed into law the 2018 Defense Authorization Act, which would allow port calls by US Navy ships to Taiwan.The move prompted senior Chinese diplomat Li Kexin to declare: “The day that a US Navy vessel arrives in Kaohsiung is the day that our People’s Liberation Army unifies Taiwan with military force.”   GETTYA Taiwanese warship taking part in naval drillsMr Deng warned increased US involvement in the South China Sea could provide Beijing with the motive it needed for military action.He said: “All is set for Beijing to unify with Taiwan by force, except for one thing – a pretext or a reason to take action. “Emboldened by US support, the Taiwanese government that Ms Tsai leads may well test China’s bottom line by further cementing its ties with America, such as with the proposed exchanges between US and Taiwanese navies.“Finally, whether Beijing decides to mobilise against Taiwan in 2020 will still depend on the decision of its leaders.

Why is it different?   World's first forest city to tackle climate change in China This is a case of back to the future, given that China made up a third of the global economy 200 years ago. He added: “If history repeats itself, it will not be running out of steam any time soon.”Its GDP increased by 6.9 per cent in 2017, growth rates the US, UK and Europe can only dream about. “China has developed a habit of continually surpassing all expectations,” Mr Ward added.Tilney managing director Jason Hollands said China is difficult to resist for long-term investors who are able to withstand short-term volatility.   GETTYChina raced ahead of the pack last year If history repeats itself, it will not be running out of steam any time soonMark Ward, head of trading at wealth adviser Sanlam UKHowever, he warned there are dangers as well: “Many analysts are concerned about the rapid growth in debt, which is now more than three times GDP.”Despite scrapping its unpopular “one child” policy in 2016, the country still faces a shortage of young people. He said: “As the population ages and workforce declines, this is slowing growth and leading to a shortfall in its pension system.”Chinese authorities are in a race against time as they deal with the twin challenges of debt and demographics that also threaten the West. Another issue is that many listed firms are controlled by the Chinese government and corporate governance is not up to Western standards.Hollands said investors should diversify their risk by purchasing a broader global emerging markets fund, rather than one that invests purely in China: “Funds to consider include Schroder Asian Alpha Plus, which has 30 per cent in Chinese firms and 20 per cent in Hong Kong, plus exposure to south Korea, India and Taiwan.”    Overwatch Chinese New Year of the Dog event SKINS for 2018 Tue, February 6, 2018BLIZZARD is bringing back the Lunar New Year in-game event, complete with new and returning skins and a longer run time.

These are the people who we believe will shape the way we see the natural world in the coming years and who have the greatest potential to deliver a positive outcome for wildlife both in the UK and abroadYou will have to see the magazine for the list in its entirety but, along with the well-known names, it also includes a street artist who paints endangered species on urban walls as well as two 13-year-olds.Prince William is placed fifth on the list through his work highlighting the perils faced by elephants and rhinos from poaching. With his father, the Prince of Wales, he has helped bring world leaders to the table for discussions on how we preserve precious megafauna for future generations to enjoy.The Magazine says: “Prince William’s decision to back a new global campaign against wildlife crime might come to be seen as a tipping point in the war against the illegal wildlife trade. “Can his charity, United for Wildlife, stem the demand for products from rhinos, elephants, tigers, pangolins, sharks and other species? He has the ear of Chinese president Xi Jinping, and images of him standing on an anti-poaching podium with David Beckham and former basketball player Yao Ming (a huge celebrity in China) have reached millions of smartphone screens where it matters – in the Far East. “It is William’s ability to attract celebrity endorsement and bring international politicians and conservation groups together that makes him such a potent force for change.” Related articles   Charity warns of growing gap between children and nature  Dream Gardens: How the other half lives  Angry Birds company join the fight against extinctionDoyen of wildlife documentary-makers, Sir David Attenborough is placed fourth on the list, with the magazine praising the 89-year-old for “relentlessly pushing boundaries in his epic natural history programmes.”The magazine adds: “Previously criticised for glossing over harsh conservation realities in his gorgeous wildlife documentaries, the veteran presenter has increasingly voiced his fears about climate change, human overpopulation, Creationism and the English badger cull, among many other issues.”Primatologist Dame Jane Goodall is also feted for her position as the most influential British conservationist. Her eponymous Jane Goodall Institute is a huge community-focussed organisation which sees her travelling the globe on speaking tours 300 days a year. The Institute works with villagers across five chimpanzee range states in Africa, and its Roots & Shoots youth movement has 150,000 members spread across 130 countries.The two 13-year-olds who make it on the Wildlife Power List are blogger Findlay Wilde and bone collector Jake McGowan.    SPThe May issue of BBC wildlife features David Attenborough, Chris Packham and Jane GoodallFindlay might not be able to vote until 2020 but is described as being “more politically than many experienced conservation suits” and famously created the Harry the Hen Harrier fibreglass mascot being used to highlight crime against birds of prey.Since the age of six Jake has been collecting animal bones and now has one of the largest private collections in the country with more than 3,000 specimens. He has globally-followed website (jakes-bones.com) and is described as proving “hands-on biology is cool”.BBC Wildlife Magazine editor, Matt Swaine, says: “These are the people who we believe will shape the way we see the natural world in the coming years and who have the greatest potential to deliver a positive outcome for wildlife both in the UK and abroad. ”The May issue of BBC Wildlife Magazine is on sale May 13.    "

That would seem to be the case if you listen to Labour MP David Lammy.Lammy said: ""He is a white, uppermiddle class man who I suspect has never, ever visited a tower block housing estate and certainly hasn't slept the night on the 20th floor of one.""Lammy went on: ""It is a shame we could not find a woman to lead this inquiry or indeed an ethnic minority to lead the inquiry in 2017."" Then, most damning of all as he is questioning the retired judge's impartiality, he said: ""I think the victims will also say to themselves, when push comes to shove, there are some powerful people here - contractors, sub-contractors, local authorities, governments - and they look like this judge. Whose side will he be on?"" It is incredible that Lammy, a man who went on to be a barrister, could be responsible for such nonsense.   Is he really saying that Sir Martin is nothing more than a successful and well-educated patsy who will cower in the face of big business or be diffident to local or central government? ow crass and offensive.Had Lammy bothered to do just a smidgen of research he would have discovered that Sir Martin was not born into the lap of luxury, knowing a life of Eton and privilege awaited him.His father was a dairyman and his mother was a teacher. Born in Wales, the family moved to England where Sir Martin excelled at school and won a place at a grammar in Tunbridge Wells.From there he went on to Cambridge and his impressive career began.Oafish Lammy appears to be suggesting you can only be empathetic to people if you have lived their lives, which is astonishing from someone supposedly so legally skilled. That means rape cases could only be heard by rape survivors and it would be helpful if you are sitting in judgment of a murderer that one of your family had been lost to murder.  GETTYHe has been described as a 'highly respected and hugely experienced' by Theresa MayHis comments have been picked up enthusiastically by Grenfell action groups where there is more than a whiff of class war at work.Indeed due to the rising tensions in the area Lammy's willingness to play the race and class card, supported by the newly elected local Labour MP Emma Dent Coad, is even more questionable.If you are in court any time soon (and I really hope that you're not) imagine the reaction if you saw a black female judge and you demanded a white male one as you believed there was no way she would be able to empathise with you. It is rightly unacceptable in any other walk of life so why over Grenfell? Perhaps Lammy should try studying some recent history and reflect on remarks made by Martin Luther King. He said: ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character."" It is time to stop judging the judge and let him get on with his unenviable task.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Charlie Gard: A timeline of the heartbreaking case Mon, July 24, 2017Charlie Gard timeline: A parents struggle to save their son.

But by the end of the parade, no test was detected.South Korea remained calm in the face of growing tension and supported President Trump’s decision to raise the stakes.“I strongly support active efforts by the President Donald Trump to solve this problem,” said politician Lee Cheol Woo, chairman of South Korea’s National Assembly Intelligence Committee.“North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles is the most serious threat against international community as well as the Korean Peninsula.

GETTYPresident Trump had hoped that Beijing would play a role in reining in Pyongyang   “China are so concerned about a unified Korea being allied with the US that they want to protect the status quo,” he said.“The one redeeming feature of North Korea is that Kim Jong-un’s highest goal is the regime’s survival,” added Mr Manning, formerly a senior strategist at the National Counterproliferation Center in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).“They’re not suicidal, they’re not al Qaeda. We are underestimating the effect of this deterrence.”Mr Manning said that while military action could achieve a short term effect, the long term answer rested in depriving Kim Jong-un of the imported luxury cars and goods he so valued. One idea is to hit him where it hurts, by focusing on his access to luxury goods and fast cars,” he said.“The US Treasury Department has become very good at tracking down bank accounts.”The American vice president Mike Pence will be in Seoul today at the start of a 10-day tour of Asia."
