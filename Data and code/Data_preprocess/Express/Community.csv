China and Russia strengthen ties against Western countries     The tariffs may have only a minor economic impact, increasing levies by $12.5 billion on Chinese shipments to the U.S. that reached $506 billion last year, amounting to an average tariff increase on overall imports from China of just 2.5 percent, , said Shane Oliver, the head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd in Sydney. The China director of the U.S. Soybean Export Council said China's decision to impose tariffs on imports of soybeans from the United States is 'regrettable' and 'won't solve the trade imbalance'.U.S. soybean futures fell more than 5 percent following the announcement. A Beijing-based soybean trader said there are growing concerns about the cancellation of previously purchased cargoes by the world's top buyer of the oilseed.Soybeans, the top U.S. agricultural export to China, were among the 106 U.S. products on which Beijing plans to impose an additional 25 percent in tariffs.The U.S. is the second-biggest soybean supplier, after Brazil, to China, the world's largest consumer of the bean.The move had been expected by the U.S. soybean industry, China Director Zhang Xiaoping told Reuters, despite the Council, which represents American soybean producers, having done ""everything"" to prevent it.China may still buy U.S. soybeans, despite the additional tariff, if the market needs supplies, said Zhang.He added: ""The main risk is that China’s response leads to a counter retaliation by the U.S. and a process of escalating tariffs that leads to a sharp slowing in trade between the two countries.""Speaking on CNBC, ambassador Cui Tiankai confirmed his country would respond “very soon”.He added: ""We will certainly respond accordingly. We will resort to the WTO — World Trade Organization — dispute settlement mechanism, and we’ll, in accordance with Chinese laws, take measures to fight back.  GETTYUS President Donald Trump has announced further trade tariffs targeting China""We certainly don't want to have any trade war with anybody, but people have to understand who started all this.”Yesterday’s White House announcement unveiled a list Tuesday of Chinese imports the administration proposes to target as part of a crackdown on what Mr Trump believes to be unfair trade practices.Sectors targeted include products used for robotics, information technology, communication technology and aerospace.Mr Tiankai warned China’s response would be “maybe with the same intensity, the same scale”.

1,Easter Christian crackdown: China arrests worshippers and BANS church groups,https://www.express.co.uk//news/world/938961/easter-christians-china-arrests-ban," 18:11, Thu, Mar 29, 2018 ","   Authorities have imposed an effective ban Christian gatherings and police are requiring Christians to report where they are going every time they leave their homes in the Henan Province.Worshippers have been placed under house arrest with Christians afraid to attend church groups amid fears the crackdown is worsening. An anonymous source said it feels like the Cultural Revolution all over again.They said: “I heard that many churches in Sheqi County also received notice that all believers cannot gather anymore. Related articles   Where Christmas was BANNED: China’s Christians suffer brutal crackd...   China sends 100 Christians to ‘re-education’ camps  “Christians are afraid of gathering and they don’t have anywhere to gather either. “Times have changed. It feels like the Cultural Revolution.”These shocking claims come from the US-based group ChinaAid, which reports religious persecution.The Cultural Revolution was between 1966 and 1976 when Mao Zedong tried to enforce atheism as the official religious belief of the Communist Party and sought to eradicate all influences besides Communism.   AFPThe Chinese government is cracking down on Churches in the Communist stateChurches in Gushi County have also reportedly been notified about the banning of religious activities.In the nearby Tanghe County authorities have told house churches to register with the government operated Three-Self Church and those who attend a house church will be fined £3,349.Earlier this month a Chinese priest shared a video of authorities tearing down crosses from a local Catholic Church in Henan during a major raid. The cathedral was sanctioned by the government and it was reported that this was the first time crosses were removed from a Catholic church in that area.  GETTYChristians in China's Henan Province have reportedly been put on house arrestChinaAid President Bob Fu told The Christian Post: “The top leadership is increasingly worried about the rapid growth of the Christian faith and their public presence, and their social influence.“It is a political fear for the Communist Party, as the number Christians in the country far outnumber the members of the party.”In February Express.co.uk reported more than 100 Christians were sent to “re-education” camps where they were believed to be taught to be loyal to the country’s ideologies.These so-called “mind-transformation centres” instructed detainees to be loyal to China and not their religion, according to persecution watchdog Open Doors.   GETTYA deal has yet to be struck between the Vatican and the Chinese governmentThe Chinese Communist Party has launched a major crackdown on religion in recent years in an attempt to oppress religious freedom and exercise control.Churches not sanctioned by the government have been put under surveillance with hundreds of Christians arrested for disturbing public order for offences such as holding bible study groups and displaying crucifixes outside their homes. There have been reports of Christians being banned from praying, singing hymns, crosses removed from buildings and people arrested for attending church services.The dialogue continues between The Vatican and China on reaching a deal that would lead to diplomats relations between the Holy See and Beijing.    A statement followed reports in China quoting a bishop backed by the Beijing government as saying that a long-awaited deal would be signed by the end of March.A senior Vatican source said earlier on Thursday that the Vatican still did not know precisely when a Chinese delegation was due to come to Rome.Catholics in China are split between those in ""underground"" communities that recognise the pope and those belonging to a state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association where bishops are appointed by the government in collaboration with local Church communities. Under the formal deal, the Vatican will have a say in negotiations for the appointment of future bishops.Some Catholic leaders outside China, particularly Cardinal Joseph Zen, 86, the outspoken former bishop of Hong Kong, has been highly critical of the accord, saying the Vatican would be ""selling out"" to China's Communist Party."

Related articles   Inside Politics: Tories realise it is time to scrap the aid target   Matt Damon and Shakira attends World Economic Forum He said: ""Whether you like it or not, the global economy is the big ocean that you cannot escape from. Any attempt to cut off flows of capital, technologies, products, industries and people between economies and channel the waters in the ocean back into isolated lakes and creeks, this is simply not possible and indeed it runs counter to the historical trend.""We must remain committed to developing free trade and investment, to promoting trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation through opening up, and we must say no to protectionism.""Pursuing protectionism is just like locking oneself in a dark room. While wind and rain may be kept outside so are light and air.""   GETTYChinese President Xi Jinping will defend globalisation in the face of mounting public hostility  IGThe Chinese premier took a pointed swipe at Brexit and Donald Trump  IGPresident Xinping said globalisation was not to blame for the world's problemsThe audience then burst into applause as he railed: ""No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war."" President Xi also pointedly added: ""Today mankind has become a close-knit community with a shared future. All countries enjoy the right to development, yet at the same time they should view their own interests in the broader context and refrain from pursuing their own interests at the expense of others."" President Xi's 50-minute long speech was the first address given at Davos by a Chinese leader, and marks the country's continually growing presence on the world stage. He used it to insist that China is open to business to the whole world and said that his country was ""not jealous of others' success"" or of those who had benefitted from globalisation. And in another barely disguised reference to Mr Trump he insisted that Beijing will ""keep its door wide open, and not close it"" and said he hoped other major economies would do the same. Whilst once again alluding to the Republican's protectionist policies, he added: ""We should adhere to multilateralism to uphold the authority and efficacy of multilateral institutions. We should honour promises and abide by rules. One should not select or bend rules as he sees fit.""    GETTYPresident Xi's presence was a sign of the shift from a uni-polar world dominated by the US  REUTERSHe is the first Chinese premier to address the exclusive forum in Switzerland No one will emerge as a winner in a trade warChinese president Xi JinpingIan Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, a US-based political risk consultancy, said that global events including Brexit and the election of Mr Trump prompted his appearance at Davos, with China prepared to take on an increasingly leading role on the world stage. He added: ""It is no coincidence that Xi chose this year to make the trip up the magic mountain."" More than half a dozen senior Chinese government figures will be in Davos this week, far more than in past years. And a large number of sessions are focused on Asia, including one entitled ""Asia Takes the Lead"". WEF founder Klaus Schwab said President Xi's presence was a sign of the shift from a uni-polar world dominated by the United States to a more multi-polar system in which rising powers like China will have to step up and play a bigger role. His appearance, a first for a Chinese leader at the annual meeting of political leaders, CEOs and bankers in Davos, comes as the part the United States plays as a force for multilateral cooperation on issues like trade and climate change is in doubt following the election of Donald Trump. Europe, meanwhile, is pre-occupied with its own troubles, from Brexit and militant attacks to the string of elections this year in which anti-globalisation populists could score gains. This has left a vacuum that China seems eager to fill. ""We can hope that China in this new world will assume a responsive and responsible leadership role,"" Mr Schwab said.

Speaking in the Swiss capital Bern on the eve of his speech, he stressed the importance of cooperation.    ""Protectionism, populism and de-globalisation are on the rise. It's not good for closer economic cooperation globally,"" Xi said. China, the world's top exporter, is heavily dependent on free trade and could be hit hard by a new wave of protectionism. Fears of a hard economic landing in China roiled global markets during last year's Davos. And while those concerns have eased, the International Monetary Fund warned on Monday of ongoing risks to the economy, including its high reliance on government spending, record lending by state banks and an overheating property market. ""China is still one of the biggest risks, and I think the only reason it is not at the top of the list is that the United States has become such a locus of uncertainty,"" Kenneth Rogoff, an economist at Harvard University, said. "

But no matter how groundbreaking for a royal his projects may be, Prince Charles have a famous predecessor who also had planned to carry out major changes in the House of Windsor - Edward VIII. Royal expert Ted Powell argues the royal, who abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson, had plans that would have caused a ""decisive break"" from traditions.  Related articles   Royal REVEAL: What Prince Charles HATES most - 'finds it embarrassing'   Prince Charles and the RHINO: Future King's 'NEAR-DEATH' experience... The author of King Edward VIII: An American Life told Express.co.uk: “When Edward came to the throne, he promised a decisive break with the cautious traditionalism of his father George V.“He consciously sought to carry on the informal, democratic approach to his royal duties which he had developed as Prince of Wales.“His formative experiences had taken place during and after World War I, when so many European monarchies had collapsed.“He recognised that the House of Windsor’s position could not be taken for granted, it had to be positively sold to each generation. READ MORE: Princess Diana: SHOCK reason behind Prince Charles divorce REVEALED - ‘It caused TENSION'  Prince Charles is 'determined to push the boundaries to prepare for a new style of monarchy' (Image: GETTY)“He grasped intuitively that the British monarchy was a product, a ‘brand’ which needed to be refreshed and marketed, and soon discovered that he himself was a natural salesman.“As part of the rebranding process, he believed that the Crown needed to modernise if it was to survive as a relevant institution – rather than an historical relic – in twentieth-century Britain.”In a similar way, Prince Charles has called for a reorganisation to adapt the Windsors to the changes that came with the 21st century.The Prince of Wales shocked the royals when he called for a “slimmed down” monarchy, which would take away titles from the members of the family too far down the succession line to ever be crowned.  Related articles   The Queen's SHOCK Princess Diana warning REVEALED   Vegans demand Prince Charles SCRAPS sale of ‘unethical’ charity teddy   Prince Charles shares his desire to reform the monarchy with Edward VIII (Image: GETTY)  Prince Charles's political stance over China left Prince Philip 'in dismay', it was claimed (Image: GETTY)His plans put him on a collision course with his brother Prince Andrew, who opposed to them as they would deprive his daughters, Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice, of their titles.Charles has also been accused of meddling in politics, taking stances on political issue such as climate change and China’s occupation of Tibet.In 1999 he went as far as snubbing a state dinner hosted by the Chinese government during its leaders’ official visit, a move believed to be a protest against Beijing.This move left his father Prince Philip in “dismay”, according to historian Max Hastings, who said: “This turned to be a source of considerable frustration and dismay to Prince Philip, who has led an intensely disciplined life, with which he's kept his mouth largely shut, under intolerable stresses and strains, and he's been this absolutely rock-like support.""   Prince Charles's reign looks set to be different from the one of the Queen's (Image: GETTY)Prince Charles’s plans to take the monarchy into the new century go back to his youth.In a letter written in 1978 to his private secretary, Prince Charles expressed he wanted to help those in need in a different way than the one adopted since by the Crown.He wrote: “I want to consider ways in which I can escape from the ceaseless round of official engagements and meet people in less artificial circumstances.”And he even declared his desire to visit “immigrant areas”, in a bid to use his fame and influence to shed a light on their issues.He said: “I want to pay more visits to immigrant areas in order to help these people to feel that they are not ignored or neglected.”Between the 1980s and the 1990s Prince Charles did get involved with helping communities in inner cities, visiting troubled neighbourhoods in London and participating to campaigns against knife crime. "

While the hacker seemed to be just having a little fun, the consequences could potentially have been much worse if the attacker had malicious intentions.”Mr Passeri warns that Blockchain explorers are like financial reporting sites for cryptocurrencies. He adds: ""Imagine if an attacker artificially altered the values of coins to represent a sharp fall in price.""This would cause panic and result in a mass selling off of these crypto coins. The attacker could take advantage of the panic and plummeting prices by purchasing the crypto coins in bulk before the manipulation is discovered and the market restored.”"

She lost her father crossing a mountain when he was swept away by a river. She lived in Bridim until she met and married a Nepalese of Tibetan origin and had six children.Lhakpa Tserdring and his young wife Tashi It is difficult to survive in NepalBridim village in the Langtang mountains is little more than a semi -circle of stone and wood houses, with a corn-grinding water mill, serried fields of fresh vegetables, an ancient monastery, water-run prayer wheels and multicoloured prayer flags releasing Buddhist scriptures the wind takes to the gods.The Tibetans of Nepal, whether they live in towns or villages, are a forgotten people, with few rights, unless, like Nangsa Lama’s sons and daughters, they have a Nepalese father and so become Nepali citizens.Tamdin Dorje Tuladhar, the chief co-ordinator for the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office, said that before the Tibetan uprisings in China in 2008, many Tibetans felt at home in Nepal, contributing to the economy by making carpets and handicrafts. Now, he said: “When they arrive in Nepal, they are arrested by the Nepali police. Since the uprisings in China the situation has got worse. The Chinese government is getting more and more suspicious of Tibetans living in Nepal.”His office’s research showed in 2010 that 13,000 to 14,000 Tibetan refugees are in Nepal. At least 9,000 do not have refugee status or any identity, says Tamdin. He said: “Tibetans here are dehumanised. They cannot work, go to college, get a driving licence; travel outside Nepal, get admission to a professional institution; they can’t open a bank account.”He finds fewer arrivals nowadays from Tibet. From the thousands, it has dropped to 16 to 20 a month fleeing across the border due to increased surveillance on both the Chinese and Nepalese sides and an improved cross-border intelligence sharing network between China and Nepal.The Tibetan issue is a delicate one for Nepal, a country of only 30 million people, but in need of infrastructure and foreign aid. Last year China gave Nepal a £80million grant, and approved a £1.1billion hydropower project.It is building roads and “Friendship Bridges” which will help trade and business but will also enable tanks and military hardware to roll down from the Chinese border to Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu.Some Tibetans are saved by sponsorship thanks to the adventurous trekkers, climbers and wildlife enthusiasts Nepal has always attracted. Tim Gocher, a British investment banker, set up a British charity, the Dolma Development Fund, 10 years ago to provide schooling.He said: “Education has the most impact. The economic future of a child is transformed – it helps future generations too.”One of Nangsa Lama’s sons, Tsering, was sponsored by a Swiss couple when he was eight and went to boarding school in Kathmandu, a long trek down to the bottom of his mountain and then a six-hour drive away. Education changed his life, and having observed trekking tourists in the mountains he resolved to develop eco tourism in the area.He formed a partnership with Gocher and is CEO of Dolma Eco-Tours.Thirty per cent of most of his income goes to supporting children helped by the Fund. Visitors embed with the village community, sleep in Tibetan lodges, eat organically grown food, and immerse in Bridim culture.Tsering has plans for an upmarket eco-lodge complex to bring permanent, rather than seasonal work, to local Tibetans.Nepalese police guard a Tibetan monasteryHowever, the 36-year-old, sporting smart trekking gear and Ray Bans, told me Bridim’s population is declining as young people go to school, graduate and then only return for festivals and weddings. “I want to bring young people back to the villages. So many fields are lying abandoned.”At the foot of the mountain, in the Syabru Bensi refugee camp, Tsering’s relative, 40-year-old Lhakpa Tsering, talks with his Sikkimese wife Tashi and nine-month-old baby girl at his side. He said: “I work as co-ordinator, looking after four refugee camps. I can’t buy land; I can’t even buy a motorcycle. I travel eight hours to Kathmandu to pick up my stipend from the Tibetan government in exile. If we get sick we have to pay lots of money and go to a private hospital. It’s very difficult to survive in Nepal.“Because the young can’t work, they take drugs. Since my wife and I don’t have citizenship, my baby can’t get it. I don’t know what the future holds.” Related articles   Nepal falls into political turmoil   Nepal torture accused faces court   Dozens die in Nepal bus accident "

So here’s the re-cap: vote Yes – that is total separation. Vote No – that can mean further devolutionDavid CameronHe said: “Let me be absolutely clear. We are committed to making devolution better still. Not to give Alex Salmond a consolation prize if Scotland votes No, but because it’s the right thing to do.”He said he shared Scottish party leader Ruth Davidson’s support for more income tax raising powers for the Scottish Parliament and added: “So here’s the re-cap: vote Yes – that is total separation. Vote No – that can mean further devolution.”He repeated the warning that the UK Government would not agree to a formal currency union to allow an independent Scotland to keep sterling.“There are a few myths doing the rounds,” he said.

Not just then but to abolish slavery, to defeat Fascism, to fight Communism, to build our NHS, to help the world’s sick and poor.“The United Kingdom has a great and glorious history and as Conservatives we’ll never be ashamed to say so.”But he also insisted the biggest part of the argument for staying together was the future, in a world of “relentless competition” which is seeing the economic rise of China, India, Brazil and Russia.He cited the whole of Britain getting behind Scot Eve Muirhead, captain of the Team GB curling squad at the Sochi Winter Olympics, and said: “Together we’ve come through the Great Recession as the fastest growing economy in Europe and together there are huge prizes to be taken in the future.”Yes Scotland chief executive Blair Jenkins said: “Mr Cameron saying only that a No vote ‘can’ lead to greater powers for Holyrood is a huge blow to the No campaign credibility.“For many months now the Tories, like their Labour partners in the anti-independence coalition, have been bandying around vague promises of more powers if only the people of Scotland vote No. We now know this is a sham.”"

Related articles   STAR WARS to become reality? - US Vice President announces SPACE FORCE   US risks Russia fury: America DOUBLES marine numbers “We are concerned with what appears to be very abnormal behaviour.”But Russia dismissed her comments as ""unfounded, slanderous accusations based on suspicions"".Dr Poblete maintained the satellite, launched in October 2017, was particularly concerning, given Russia’s repeated public statements about its desire to develop defence capabilities in space.On March 1, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his country’s Space Troops had received a mobile laser system, and Dr Poblete noted Mr Putin had himself alluded to space weapons being more “acceptable in the political and military respect”.  US Vice President Mike Pence (right) announced plans to build a new, separate Space Force (Image: GETTY)  A Long March-4C rocket lifts off from the southwestern Xichang launch centre, China (Image: GETTY)She claimed Russia’s proposals for a treaty detailed by Russia’s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, were not to be taken seriously.Referring to the satellite, she said: “For the United States, this information strengthens our belief that the proposed PPWT has major flaws that make it unviable and demonstrates that any space arms control agreement is unverifiable at this time.”Alexander Deyneko, a Russian delegate at the Swiss conference, called Dr Poblete’s remarks “the same unfounded, slanderous accusations based on suspicions, on suppositions and so on”.He said: “We are seeing that the American side is raising their serious concerns about Russia, so you would think they ought to be the first to support the Russian initiative.”   The news of the satellite comes after US Vice President Mike Pence announced plans to build a new, separate Space Force as a sixth US military service.The 59-year-old US Vice President claimed a space force was required to ensure America’s “dominance” in space, amid growing antagonism and threats from China and Russia.A report for the US and China Economic and Security Review Commission stated the Chinese military was trying to develop the ability to attack the US in space.The report stated: “Chinese analysts surmise that the loss of critical sensor and communications capabilities could imperil the US military’s ability to achieve victory”.  A Soyuz 2.1b rocket booster launched from the Vostochny Cosmodrome (Image: GETTY )In response to the report’s findings, speaking at the Pentagon earlier this month, Mr Pence said: “The United States Space Force will strengthen our security and ensure our prosperity, and it will also carry American ideals into the boundless expanse of space.“All other nations increasingly possess the capabilities to operate in space - not all of them share our commitment to freedom, private property and the rule of law.”The Vice President argued the purpose of the US Space Force was to carry “America’s commitment to freedom into this new frontier”.Physically interfering with satellites, known as a “hard-kill”, is technically impossible.  Mr Trump walks on the South Lawn of the White House after arriving on Marine One (Image: GETTY)More probable is a cyber attack - known as “soft-kill” - that could render communication obsolete.An RAF spokesman said: “The UK does not have the industrial muscle or money to do a hard-kill.“But the US probably will in the near future and the UK will look to get involved.“We do have some soft-kill capability, such as jamming.”   What is the new US Space Force?It is not currently clear the precise nature of the service - but it is thought to comprise a military force with fighting capabilities in space.Donald Trump has tasked the US Department of Defence and The Pentagon with the creation of a new force to uphold “American dominance” in space.Alongside the US Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard, it will comprise the sixth arm of the US armed forces. Mr Trump wants to counter Russian and Chinese developments in space tech.The US already has some space fighting capabilities, with long-range missiles to satellite tracking.Trump said in the East Room of the White House: “My administration is reclaiming America's heritage as the world's greatest spacefaring nation.“The essence of the American character is to explore new horizons and to tame new frontiers."""

This is not a useful activity. “You’re playing a psychological, win-lose battle against other humans with money as the sole objective. Even if you win money through dumb luck, you have lost time and energy, which means you have lost.“Investing means buying an asset that actually creates products, services or cashflow, such as a profitable business or a rentable piece of real estate, for an extended period of time. “An investment is something that has intrinsic value – that is, it would be worth owning from a financial perspective, even if you could never sell it.”  GETTYRipple price: South Korean officials have pledged to ban the speculative trade of cryptocurrencies10.30am: South Korean ban on crypto trading postponedKorean regulators sent shockwaves through the markets last week, after Justice Minister Park Sang-ki announced his decision to ban the trade of digital currencies.But an official from the Office for Government Policy Coordination has now revealed that the plans have not been finalised yet.He told a press conference: “The plan to ban cryptocurrency exchanges, recently mentioned by the nation’s justice minister, is one measure in talks to curb speculative investments, which the government will carry on with enough discussion for before finalising the decision.”On January 11, Mr Park threatened to put an end to the highly speculative trade of cryptocurrencies.Digital tokens like bitcoin and Ripple tend to trade with 30 percent premiums in South Korea.9.07am: Ripple volatility is a ‘mystery’ claims crypto expertTiffany Hayden, community manager of blockchain wallet Edge, said that she does not know why cryptocurrencies exhibit such high degrees of volatility.Replying to a questions about Ripple on social media, Ms Hayden said that short-term owning of XRP is a frustrating venture.She said: “I have no idea why crypto is so volatile. Bitcoin came so close to hitting $20K last month and now it’s under $14K. “Alts often follow suit. $XRP is more frustrating to own, short-term, IMO. It moves differently.

32,‘Not worth it anymore!’ HAMMER BLOW for Juncker as nations dump EU trade deals post-Brexit,https://www.express.co.uk//news/world/713260/European-Union-EU-trade-Africa-Caribbean-Pacific-EPAs-TTIP-CETA-Brexit," 11:49, Thu, Sep 22, 2016 ","  GETTYThe EU's trade policy is in chaosUp and coming nations in Africa and the Caribbean will no longer see any worth in being tied to dictatorial Brussels policies now that the UK is no longer part of the bloc. And they could be about to torpedo the EU’s roll-out of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA), which are designed to create a free-trade zone between Europe, Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.  Related articles   Brussels under siege as THOUSANDS march against hated EU trade deals   'We WON'T negotiate' Canada refuses to budge over terms of CETA deal That is the view of top academics Christopher Stevens and Jane Kennan, from the Overseas Development Institute, who say Brexit has given many governments an excuse to pull out of the deeply unpopular scheme. Tanzania has already ditched a proposed deal between Brussels and the East Africa Community (ECA) countries, citing the “turmoil” engulfing the EU following the Brexit vote and the skewed terms of the agreement.   AFPBrussels has been rocked by opposition to its unpopular policies  AFPMEPs have warned the bloc is in danger of becoming irrelevantThe country’s Foreign Affairs permanent secretary Aziz Mlima blasted: “Our experts have established that the way it has been crafted, the EPA will not benefit local industries in East Africa. Instead it will lead to their destruction as developed countries are likely to dominate the market.” And now the two trade experts have predicted that a number of other African and Caribbean countries will follow suit, because for most Commonwealth countries Britain is by far the biggest market for their exports. In an essay on the future of Britain’s trade policy post-Brexit, the pair wrote: “Although some Africa, Caribbean and Pacific signatories have embraced the required policy changes, for many the whole EPA process remains deeply contentious. “The post-Brexit announcement by Tanzania that it will not proceed with the East African EPA is merely the most recent example of delay and backtracking on implementation.”    A number of countries have been stalling on implementing the trade agreements, agreed as far back as 2008, over concerns about the power they will hand to Brussels to meddle in national affairs. And the economists predicted that the Caribbean - held up as the ‘EPA poster boy’ by Brussels bureaucrats - could be the “first to split” and sink another key area of EU trade policy. Even though Britain is no longer considered a “dominant EU importer” from Africa, Caribbean and Pacific countries it does still “absorb a significant share” of the goods those countries sell, they added. The news comes as Europe’s much-vaunted trade clout withers away, with Brussels staggering from crisis to crisis as it tries to close out a number of flagship deals.  Brexit aftershocks: Who's next to leave the EU?

34,"'We're running out of time' North Korea is grave nuclear threat, Trump adviser warns",https://www.express.co.uk//news/world/855726/north-korea-kim-jong-un-donald-trump-united-states-nuclear-threat-latest," 17:33, Mon, Sep 18, 2017 ","   North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has stepped up aggression towards the United States and its allies in recent months with missile testing, including firing two rockets over Japan, into the Pacific Ocean.Now the US President’s National Security Advisor, General H.R. McMaster, has warned that a new sense of urgency is required among the allies if they are to stop Kim making further advances with his nuclear weapons programme.Speaking exclusively to international interviewer Daphne Barak, Gen. McMaster outlined the difficulties faced by the international community saying it was “impossible to predict” how the crisis would develop due to the nature of Kim’s brutal regime.He said: “This is a regime that has committed egregious crimes against its own people—that has carried out an assassination in a public airport using a banned nerve agent, and repeatedly shows its disregard for its international obligations.   Related articles   North Korea only responds to STRENGTH not sanctions says ex-ambassador   US veteran warns North Korea military action is OFF the table  The President has made clear to the world that North Korea is now a grave threat to all of usGeneral H.R. McMaster“How predictable is a regime like that, in terms of using the most destructive weapon on earth?“The President has made clear to the world that North Korea is now a grave threat to all of us.  “Because it is a global problem, we see the international community joining us in sanctioning North Korea.""What is different today than in the past is urgency. North Korea is rapidly advancing its missile and nuclear capabilities.  “We do not have time.”The General praised President Donald Trump for bringing the world together in condemnation of the North Korean leader, in particular his work with China.  AFP GETTYNorth Korea is a grave nuclear threat, Trump's adviser has warned  EXPRESSDonald Trump supporter Tom Barrack, international interviewer Daphne Barak and Gen. H.R. McMasterBut he suggested the Chinese could do even more to help avert any further escalation in the crisis.He added: “A great achievement of President Trump—in addition to uniting many nations and building consensus—has been to work with China, and increase Beijing’s cooperation in pressuring North Korea, through imposing new sanctions, and by enforcing existing sanctions.  “There may be limits on what China is willing to do.  We’ll see.  “But there’s no question that China has more leverage than any other country to convince North Korea that pursuing nuclear weapons is against Pyongyang’s own national security interests. We are not asking China to do us or anyone a favour. “It is clear that a nuclear armed North Korea is a grave threat to China.”He also backed President Trump’s tough stance on talks warning the North Koreans that they must make the “first step” to bring lasting peace. Gen. McMaster said: ""The President has directed us not to repeat the mistakes of the past. Past efforts have resulted in long, drawn out talks that delivered unsatisfactory, weak agreements that North Korea immediately broke.    AFP GETTYNorth Korea's Kim Jong-un has stepped up aggression towards the US   REUTERSNorth Korea's launch of a Hwasong-12 missile sparked worldwide fury “We have stated repeatedly that the door to dialogue is open, but North Korea must, as a first step, stop its increasingly provocative and threatening actions and take initial steps towards de-nuclearisation.”Worryingly, Gen.McMaster sees a similar threat growing in Iran despite the deal signed in 2015, the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA), where they promised to curb their nuclear ambitions.He said: ""As President Trump has repeatedly said, the Iran nuclear deal was the worst deal of all time.  “Iran can wait out the deal, and when it expires, have a threshold capability that will allow the regime to move toward nuclear weapons very quickly. ""President Trump will make the decision about our ongoing participation in the JCPOA according to his top priority, which is the safety of the American people."" The General wants the international community to make sure the deal is enforced more rigorously to stifle Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.He said: “The first step is to rigorously enforce the deal. There are all sorts of inspections which could be made and are not made.     “All parties should insist on rigorous enforcement.”Discussing Afghanistan and Pakistan, the General signalled a change in focus compared to previous administrations.Regarding Afghanistan he said: “For too long we focused on tactics—debating the precise numbers of troops to commit - when our focus should have been on strategy – how to achieve a sustainable outcome in Afghanistan and South Asia consistent with US  and our allies’ vital interests. “The President demanded a complete appraisal of the situation, challenged assumptions, and asked all of the tough questions. He directed the development of a strategy that prioritises the security of American citizens and the US homeland; provides US, Afghan and coalition forces all of the tools and authorities necessary to defeat the enemy; is sustainable over time; and shares responsibilities and burdens with others.”He also signalled a change in dealing with the threat from terrorists within Pakistan, adding; “We are fundamentally changing how we approach the problem of terrorist safe havens in Pakistan.  North Korea celebrates nuclear test Thu, September 7, 2017North Korea held a mass celebration for the scientists involved in carrying out its largest nuclear blast to date, with fireworks and a mass rally in Pyongyang Play slideshow  AFP/Getty Images1 of 17Korean People's Army (KPA) soldiers cheer during a mass celebration in Pyongyang          {% var pictureLinkTpl = ""/pictures/pics/2222/3333/1111""; %}        {% var oldThumbUrlTpl = ""https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/116x87/{id}.jpg""; %}        {% var newThumbUrlTpl = ""https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/64x64/{id}.jpg""; %}        {% for (var i in o.thumbs) { %}            {% if (i > 6) { break; } %}            {% var thumb = o.thumbs[i]; %}            <li class=""{% if (i == 0) { %}active {% } %}jcarousel-item jcarousel-item-horizontal jcarousel-item-{%=thumb.position%} jcarousel-item-{%=thumb.position%}-horizontal"">                <{%='a'%} href=""{%=pictureLinkTpl.replace('1111', thumb.id).replace('2222', thumb.gallery_id).replace('3333', thumb.gallery_slug)%}"">                    {% var src = newThumbUrlTpl; %}                    {% if (thumb.largestimage == '517x') { %}                        {% var src = oldThumbUrlTpl; %}                    {% } %}                    <img class=""loaded"" src=""{%=src.replace('{id}', thumb.id)%}"" alt=""{%=thumb.alt%}"" title=""{%=thumb.title%}"" width=""{%=thumb.width%}"" height=""{%=thumb.height%}"">                </{%='a'%}>            </li>        {% } %}    “The President expects Pakistan to take decisive action against terrorist groups based on its territory and will condition US security aid to Pakistan, accordingly. “Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our efforts in the region. But it also has much to lose unless it stops its support of groups that are attacking US interests in Afghanistan.”Turning to Iraq, the General was critical of the way the country was left to cope politically following the withdrawal of US troops.He said: “Most problems in Iraq today stem from our disengagement, before military gains were consolidated politically.  “The complete withdrawal of US forces in 2011 led to the collapse of large portions of the Iraqi state and the rise ISIS, which led for example to the fall of Mosul.  “Courageous Iraqi forces recently liberated that city, in part, because of President Trump's decision to prioritise the fight against ISIS and to give his commanders the necessary authority to fight and support partner forces more effectively.Regarding the country’s future, he explained: “Now is not the time to divide the country.  If Iraq fragments, the main beneficiaries will be the Iranian regime or groups like ISIS, both of whom seek to perpetuate ethnic and sectarian conflict among Iraqis.  “The best weapon against these dangerous forces is Iraqi political unity based on a common vision for a secure and prosperous Iraq.”    Overall Gen. McMaster did sound confident about hopes for eventual peace in the Middle East.In particular he pointed to the consensus surrounding Iran’s threat as evidence of hope to make lasting peaceful agreements in the region.He said: “What changed regionally can help change the problem. It can lead to new partnerships and relationships.“There is a greater alignment, among the Arabs against Iran.“If any Arab state would ask themselves: ‘What is the biggest threat  to our security today?’ No one would say, it is Israel - it is Iran!“All the Arab states recognise the threat that Iran poses.“This recognition leads to tremendous possibilities which could lead not only to the security of Israel but create some of the conditions necessary for lasting peace between Israel and Palestinians, but also improve the security of the Arab states in the region as well.”Gen. McMaster also talked up the USA’s close bonds with Britain, backing up President Trump’s desire to strengthen the ‘special relationship’ after Brexit.“The US view is that we want to do everything we can to preserve and strengthen the special relationship. “We are bound together by common interests and values. The problems we face today are problems that demand international responses.  “That heightens the importance of our relationship with the UK and our relationship with Europe as well.”"

36,First compensation paid out to relatives of missing Malaysia Airlines flight passengers,https://www.express.co.uk//news/world/482248/First-compensation-paid-out-to-relatives-of-missing-Malaysia-Airlines-flight-passengers," 16:48, Fri, Jun 13, 2014 ","A girk walks in front of the wall of hope for missing Malaysia Airline flight MH370[EPA]The jet is thought to have crashed in the Indian Ocean on March 8 with 239 people aboard, but a search has found no trace. There were 153 Chinese passengers aboard.  Malaysian Deputy Foreign Minister Hamzah Zainuddin said that six Malaysian and one Chinese family had so far received initial payments of $50,000 (£30,000).Relatives of all 239 missing passengers can claim up to $175,000 (£103,000) and insurers are looking into the claims of a further 40 Chinese families.Mr Zainuddin said full payout – which comes via Malaysia Airlines’ insurance company - would come after the plane is found or officially declared lost.  But Steve Wang, a spokesman for some of the relatives, said today that families of 127 Chinese passengers have indicated that they will reject any preliminary compensation, partly because they think that Malaysia Airlines should be paying them economic assistance while the search for the plane continues.  He said they believe that this assistance should be unrelated to any payout given once the incident is ruled a crash and that Malaysia Airlines is trying to shirk that responsibility by offering the preliminary compensation. He said: ""Once you can issue a convincing report that announces that all the people on the plane have died, then fine, we will move into the compensation phase."" he said.  Meanwhile Malaysian and Australian officials discussed cost-sharing this week in Sydney, but Australian Transport Minister Warren Truss declined to say whether the country was even considering an even split of the bill for a search that will take months, if not years, and cost tens of millions of dollars at a minimum.   Related articles   Stray bullet may have downed the missing Malaysian jet   Families hopeful as raw data from search for missing Malaysia Airlines plane released   Could this image locate MH370?

There is a Chinese overproduction and we must not allow the European and American markets to be invaded by Chinese overproduction.”Mr Tajani has ""wished for this principle to be accepted by the United States and for President Trump to understand the difference between friends and those who have trade policies that go against the US”.   The European Commission, which coordinates trade policy for the 28 EU members, is also arguing for Mr Trump to drop his controversial trade tariffs against the EU, claiming that the bloc should be permanently exempted from the tariffs since it was not the cause of overcapacity in steel and aluminium.The Commission said earlier this week: “The US decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions.”Germany, whose trade surplus has attracted criticism from Trump, said it expected a permanent exemption.German economy minister Peter Altmaier said, has urged for more talks with Washington, said: “I am firmly convinced that in the interests of jobs in Germany, in Europe and in the USA, we need a long-term provision and that raising tariffs is the wrong way.”Additional reporting from Monika Pallenberg"

But the reality is that Earth Hour teaches all the wrong lessens, and it actually increases CO2 emissions,” he wrote in a commentary for Project Syndicate. ""During Earth Hour, any significant drop in electricity demand will entail a reduction in CO2 emissions during the hour, but it will be offset by the surge from firing up coal or gas stations to restore electricity supplies afterward.""The professor claimed that the entire world turning off its lights would only be equivalent to China stopping its CO2 emissions for four minutes."

We need to know why to extend, what for, what’s the plan. The ball is clearly in the British side.”"

However, this is simply not the case. The Remain campaign portray farmers as the biggest potential losers from Brexit because of the subsidies that we receive through the Common Agricultural Policy.What many apparently fail to understand is that these subsidies originate as UK money that is paid to Brussels then returned to us bound in an abundance of regulation and red tape. The CAP makes every aspect of my farming life very difficult and it is only getting worse with each reform.Related articles   The Great British public will be the real losers of the EU referendum Currently we have the same rules to fit all nations which makes no sense when you have people farming reindeer at -40C in the Arctic Circle, olive growers in the Mediterranean at +40C and everything else in between – it just can’t work. By leaving the EU we can have a fairer agricultural policy that will suit our own industry and we will no longer be subsidising our competitors as net contributors to the CAP.The current payment scheme from Brussels is rewarding inefficiency which is contributing to the lack of opportunities for new entrants into the agricultural sector. For the longterm future of our industry we must vote to leave the EU.Harsimrat Kaur is a 24-year-old marketing specialist from Bradford  PHWe need to have a fair immigration policy, says Harsimrat KaurWhen I graduated and went into jobsearch mode the thing that astonished me was that there was always the question “do you have a UK or EU passport?” Candidates from EU countries get preferential treatment as they can come to Britain without visas or any application process while people from non-EU countries like India, Australia, China and Canada don’t.They have to apply for a visa and get sponsorship before being allowed here – and there is no guarantee they can stay. My grandfather came to the UK in 1963 from India. Britain gave him the chance to earn a fair day’s wage for a fair day’s work. It became his home, allowing him to run his own business and give back to a society that he was proud to be part of.Being a part of the EU allows EU citizens to have the right to come here – not based on skills, education, or what they can contribute to society – but based on where they were born. We need to have a fair immigration policy that levels the playing field for everyone. Next week we can leave the EU and join the world.

The European Union is a centralised and controlling power, in which it attempts to impose a uniform set of rules for all 28 members so that there is a level playing field.This is a good thing for some people but it is not a good thing when trying to create jobs and grow a business. We have seen how many countries in the eurozone are facing dire youth unemployment, which is devastating for an entire generation.I do not want this future for my children so by voting to leave the EU I believe I am giving them an opportunity to make their way in the world, just as the UK will be doing if we vote to leave. Michael Reid, 52, has been a fisherman for more than 30 years and runs the family-owned boat ‘APOLLO ’ INS 179 from the small coastal village of Avoch, near Inverness, in the north-east of ScotlandWhen Edward Heath surrendered our fishing rights for membership of the EU more than 40 years ago, he said that the British fishing fleet was “expendable”. The result of EU membership allowed foreign vessels from France, Spain and others to fish in our waters under the guise of the Common Fisheries Policy.These member states were given a large share of the UK fi sh quota to allow them to fish around our coast. And as a result much of the UK fleet was subsequently decommissioned to accommodate these foreign vessels. We have not only seen the demise of the once proud British fleet but also the coastal communities that support them.  PHA vote for Brexit would have a huge impact for the fishing industry, says Michael ReidTowns and villages that were at one time home to many vessels no longer have any fishing boats. Being a skipper of a Scottish fishing vessel we have struggled to get by on the quotas handed out annually by Brussels which force us to dump large quantities of fish. How appalling it is to be throwing away prime fish, dead, back into the sea while watching our foreign neighbours fill their boats.Already this year we have seen the premature closure of the West of Scotland monkfish fishery to most Scottish vessels. The result being any monkfish caught in these waters must now be dumped dead back into the sea. A vote for Brexit would have a huge impact for the fishing industry.Not only would we regain control of our own waters but also the UK fish quota allocation. This in turn would almost definitely see a regeneration of fishing vessels and allow the coastal communities to flourish. Young blood, which the industry so desperately needs, would be attracted to a more prosperous industry.Darren Grimes, 22, is a fashion with business studies student at Brighton UniversityMy generation has been dubbed the “most entrepreneurial generation”, thanks to our overwhelming desire to start our own business, be self-employed or own our own company. I believe our generation of creatives and tech savvy movers and shakers are best placed to put to use their entrepreneurial spirit and ambition outside of the European Union.We should be outside a protectionist and unreformable fortress Europe which seeks to regulate the on-demand Uber, tax and force quotas upon streaming service Netflix, or asphyxiate the fastgrowing and potentially life-saving e-cigarette market.  EXPRESS/ TIM CLARKEWe should be outside a protectionist and unreformable fortress Europe, says Darren GrimesIt is these kinds of great market disrupters, for which the EU holds such disdain , that our generation could design more of and massively boost our GDP. Outside of the EU we could unravel ourselves from red tape which costs our businesses to the tune of £600million every single week.We could look to the growth economies of the world such as China and India who will dominate the 21st century, signing new trade deals which would bring hundreds of thousands of new jobs to our shores. This is something we’re unable to do from inside the EU, after giving up our power to speak for ourselves when it comes to trade.I’m voting to leave to look forward to a brighter future in a liberal, prosperous, free-trading, open and global Britain.

First and foremost I am alarmed at the speed of change of the EU and the enormous impact it has on the “older” EU countries like the UK.While I understand the importance of deepening and strengthening democracy by bringing less well-off and historically less democratic countries into the fold, I feel tremendous concern at the effect this has had and will continue to have on our country. My particular concern today is the prospect of yet more countries joining the EU (Serbia, Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey) and the inevitable influx this will bring to the UK.  PETER CORNSI have no confidence in the European Union as an institution, says Ann Willans I have lost faith in the politicians who say that this is a good thing for our country. They do not understand how such large numbers arriving in quick succession affect whole communities. I also do not believe that Turkey will never join. It may not happen in my lifetime but the discussions have commenced so there is no turning back.Turkey is culturally and religiously very different to the bulk of current EU nations and while the UK is exemplary at celebrating diversity, we can only do this in situations that we can control. My second reason for voting to leave is because I have no confidence in the European Union as an institution. It is too large, too bureaucratic and too unaccountable.This is one of the reasons that so many people across the EU feel no attachment to it. We feel powerless to influence the way it operates. Instead we feel – rightly or wrongly – that it tells us what to do rather than it receiving a mandate from the people. With that unaccountability comes mistrust.Ordinary people such as myself feel that it is run by over paid bureaucrats who have a job for life and enjoy salaries that few of us, least of all UK public servants, could ever expect. Added to which we have no way of removing many of them.Related articles   Michael Gove dismisses George Osborne's doom-mongering Brexit Budget  UKIP advertising campaign sends a message that we are better OUT  Outrage at ‘thickies will back Brexit’ jibe by Labour councillor"
46,Has the gloss come off Michael Sheen? Accomplished actor 'sad' about Brexit,https://www.express.co.uk//life-style/life/745336/michael-sheen-brexit-sad-acting-politics-port-talbot," PUBLISHED:  00:01, Tue, Dec 20, 2016 ","  GETTYMichael Sheen first foray into UK politics came when he fronted a BBC Wales documentary in JuneSo voluminous was the amount of smoke and steam that billowed out from its chimneys and stacks that, as a youngster, he thought it made the clouds. At night he took comfort from the fires of its furnaces and the lights in its buildings that could be seen for miles around. As Sheen grew older he kicked a ball around in the shadow of the plant and was such a good footballer by the age of 12 that a local scout engineered an offer for him to join the Arsenal youth team. But there was no way his parents were going to decamp to London. The plant was their life too.  Related articles   Day and Night: Michael Sheen debunks reports he is quitting Hollywood   Katie Hopkins SLAMS Michael Sheen after he 'swaps acting for politics' His father Meyrick – who later became a professional Jack Nicholson impersonator – was a personnel officer for the British Steel Corporation while his mum Irene had worked at the plant as a secretary. Given this background perhaps we should not be surprised that the threat to the plant’s future that emerged earlier this year politicised Sheen as never before. And as a film star, who had followed fellow local heroes Richard Burton and Sir Anthony Hopkins to Hollywood, he had access to a media network eager to trumpet his views. At the weekend it was reported that Sheen, who made his name with uncannily realistic movie portrayals of Tony Blair, Brian Clough and Sir David Frost, was even ready to give up acting to devote his energies to fighting the rise of the “hard populist right”.   GETTYSheen grew up in the south Wales town of Port TalbotAt this point it’s easy to turn off and dismiss his ambitions as the virtue signalling of yet another Labour luvvie.  l think this is a case of looking at Port Talbot through Hollywood-tinted spectaclesPensioner Dai WilliamsBut unlike the Harrow-educated Benedict Cumberbatch, who harangued audiences at the Barbican after his performances in Hamlet with impromptu diatribes against our policy on Syria, Sheen appears to have more of a grip on real life. While he describes Ukip as “a bunch of numpties”, he does understand why 57 per cent of Port Talbot voters opted for Brexit. “It can’t be a coincidence that the communities who have had the greatest loss through de-industrialisation and have felt the loss hardest through globalisation, about manufacturing jobs going elsewhere… seem to have voted most to leave,” he said in an interview last month. “Taking back control is a very powerful message for those communities. ”Sheen also argued that, while Donald Trump may be the man “with the orange face and a squirrel on his head”, the US president-elect understood that segments of the American electorate were deeply concerned about trends such as manufacturing jobs disappearing abroad and stagnating rates of pay.But he adds: “What must be resisted is the re-emerging spectre of fascism in the West. Our democracy must be defended and each of us needs to decide how we can contribute to that effort.” Sheen’s first high-profile foray into UK national politics came in June when he fronted a BBC Wales documentary entitled, Michael Sheen: The Fight For My Steel Town.   GETTYNews of his intentions to quit acting hit the headlines on Saturday The programme was a response to the news that the Indian conglomerate Tata – which acquired the Port Talbot plant in 2007 when it bought Corus Steel UK – was selling its loss-making UK steel business following devastating losses caused by its dwindling share of the global market, because of China “dumping” cheap steel.But, while Sheen remains a popular fi gure in his home town, his implied criticisms of his erstwhile neighbours have not gone down well. Pensioner Dai Williams said: “l think this is a case of looking at Port Talbot through Hollywood-tinted spectacles. The problems we have here are economic, not political.” Railway worker Brian Rendall, 49, added: “There’s isn’t the slightest risk of fascism here. Sheen seems to be a nice bloke but he sounds a bit misguided. He should stick to acting and leave the politics alone. We’ve got quite enough luvvies in this country already.” THE BREXITEERS Sun, January 17, 2016Brexit: Independent experts have drawn up a list of the most influential people on Brexit Play slideshow  1 of 51          {% var pictureLinkTpl = ""/pictures/pics/2222/3333/1111""; %}        {% var oldThumbUrlTpl = ""https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/116x87/{id}.jpg""; %}        {% var newThumbUrlTpl = ""https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/64x64/{id}.jpg""; %}        {% for (var i in o.thumbs) { %}            {% if (i > 6) { break; } %}            {% var thumb = o.thumbs[i]; %}            <li class=""{% if (i == 0) { %}active {% } %}jcarousel-item jcarousel-item-horizontal jcarousel-item-{%=thumb.position%} jcarousel-item-{%=thumb.position%}-horizontal"">                <{%='a'%} href=""{%=pictureLinkTpl.replace('1111', thumb.id).replace('2222', thumb.gallery_id).replace('3333', thumb.gallery_slug)%}"">                    {% var src = newThumbUrlTpl; %}                    {% if (thumb.largestimage == '517x') { %}                        {% var src = oldThumbUrlTpl; %}                    {% } %}                    <img class=""loaded"" src=""{%=src.replace('{id}', thumb.id)%}"" alt=""{%=thumb.alt%}"" title=""{%=thumb.title%}"" width=""{%=thumb.width%}"" height=""{%=thumb.height%}"">                </{%='a'%}>            </li>        {% } %}    After news of his intentions hit the headlines on Saturday, Sheen was keen to row back from the idea that he might be quitting the movie business entirely and relocating from Tinseltown to Port Talbot. In a blog posted later that day he wrote: “I DID NOT declare that I’m ‘quitting acting and leaving Hollywood’ to go into politics. In the original interview I said I have become more involved with community issues back at home over the last few years and because of the political situation it’s something I would like to focus on more. “The interviewer asked what that meant for my career and I said it might mean I work less as an actor and maybe even stop for a while AT SOME POINT. But I don’t really know yet.” Meanwhile, Port Talbot’s future is looking brighter , helped in part by the slump in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote making its exports cheaper. Tata has taken its Welsh operations off the market and is negotiating a long-term deal with its workforce."

Related articles   Forget the beer - save the crumpets! CO2 shortage halts crumpet pro...   Beer drinkers face huge price hikes with UK heatwave to blame Scientists warn prices will go up the most in such wealthy, beer-loving countries as Belgium, Canada, Denmark and Poland.For example during severe drought years, Irish beer drinkers could need to pay the equivalent of an extra £15 or $20 to buy a six-pack from an off licence.Consumption in the US could also decrease between 1.08 billion and 3.48 billion litres because of widespread and severe drought and heatwaves.Professor of climate change economics Dabo Guan at the the University of East Anglia said: ""Increasingly research has begun to project the impacts of climate change on world food production, focusing on staple crops such as wheat, maize, soybean, and rice.  Global warming could cause beer shortage (Image: Jack Andersen/Getty Images)  The average UK price of £3.60 a pint could hit over £7 (Image: Kris Connor/Getty Images)""However, if adaptation efforts prioritise necessities, climate change may undermine the availability, stability and access to 'luxury' goods to a greater extent than staple foods.""People's diet security is equally important to food security in many aspects of society.""Although some attention has been paid to the potential impacts of climate change on luxury crops such as wine and coffee, the impacts on beer have not been carefully evaluated.""A sufficient beer supply may help with the stability of entertainment and communication in society.""The co-ordinator of the research and UK lead author added: ""While the effects on beer may seem modest in comparison to many of the other - some life-threatening - impacts of climate change, there is nonetheless something fundamental in the cross-cultural appreciation of beer.""It may be argued that consuming less beer isn't itself disastrous, and may even have health benefits.""Nevertheless, there is little doubt that for millions of people around the world, the climate impacts on beer availability and price will add insult to injury.""  Poor barley crops which are a key ingredient in making a pint (Image:  Ian Waldie/Getty Images)Co-author Associate Professor of Earth system science Steven Davis of the University of California, Irvine, added: ""The world is facing many life-threatening impacts of climate change, so people having to spend a bit more to drink beer may seem trivial by comparison.""But there is definitely a cross-cultural appeal to beer, and not having a cool pint at the end of an increasingly common hot day just adds insult to injury.""Beer is the most popular alcoholic drink in the world by volume consumed so any impact on beer crops will affect the amount brewed.In recent years, the beer sector has consumed around a sixth - 17% - of global barley production, but this share varies drastically across major beer-producing countries, for example from 83% in Brazil to 9% in Australia.The international study involved researchers from the UK, China, Mexico, and the US, who identified extreme climate events and modelled the impacts of these on barley yields in 34 world regions.They then examined the effects of the resulting barley supply shock on the supply and price of beer in each region under a range of future climate scenarios.Results from the new study reveal potential average yield losses ranging from 3% to 17% depending on the severity of the conditions.Decreases in the global supply of barley lead to proportionally larger decreases in barley used to make beer.  In the UK, beer consumption could fall by between 0.65 billion and 2.34 billion pints (Image: Matt Cardy/Getty Images)During the most severe climate events, the results indicate that global beer consumption would decline by 16%, or 29 billion litres - roughly equal to the total annual beer consumption in the US.Even in less severe extreme events, beer consumption drops by 4% and prices rise by 15%.The researchers suggest changes in barley supply due to extreme events will affect the barley available for making beer differently in each region, as the allocation of barley among livestock feed, beer brewing, and other uses will depend on region-specific prices and demand flexibilities as different industries seek to maximise profits.Their findings show that global and country-level barley supply declines progressively in more severe extreme event years, with the largest mean supply decreasing by 27-38% in some European countries, such as Belgium, the Czech Republic and Germany.The study was published in the journal Nature Plants."

He was so quick and we were terrified because he has no sense of danger and then when things go wrong, he gets incredibly upset. “He will run up to a strange dog to stroke it and then get very frightened because it behaves unexpectedly and suddenly everything is unfamiliar.” Alby was diagnosed with autism just before his fifth birthday and that diagnosis changed the family’s life immeasurably. Strict routines now govern every aspect of life – from teeth-cleaning to dressing – because Alby gets distressed when things go awry. “We have to think ahead all the time, because when things change he goes into a meltdown and gets incredibly sad. What if the ducks aren’t there when we go to the park? What if they don’t have his favourite sweets in the shop? Little things can unsettle him and make him very unhappy.”   GETTYGethin Jones has called for more support for families with autistic childrenAround 700,000 people in Britain have autism, which equates to over one in 100 of the population. “Autism affects everyone differently and while we don’t yet know what causes it, we think it is a neuro-developmental disability – something to do with the way the brain is wired,” says Mark Lever of the National Autistic Society. “Some people on the autistic spectrum may be under or oversensitive to sounds, touch, tastes, smells, light or colours which can make everyday life extremely difficult.“They can also find social situations and change a challenge, sometimes leading to extreme levels of anxiety and can experience a ‘meltdown’ if overwhelmed by anxiety and sensory overload. “So the child you may have seen screaming on a supermarket floor may well have autism and has been overwhelmed by the fluorescent lights or the drop in temperature as they pass the chiller cabinets.” Adults often develop coping mechanisms, such as a gentle rocking, to help themselves. “Alby lights up my life and I love doing things with him,” says 37-year-old Gethin. “We go swimming at our local pool, get dried and changed and then we always have a chocolate muffin.”   GETTYGethin was a contestent on the 2007 series of Strictly Come Dancing, finishing third overallBut on one occasion things went badly wrong when the leisure centre had run out of chocolate muffins.  Autism affects everyone differently and while we don’t yet know what causes it, we think it is a neuro-developmental disabilityMark Lever, National Autistic Society“Someone got on a golf cart and drove off to the resort’s hotel and came back with a chocolate muffin just for Alby, because they know him and understand how devastating it can be for him when things aren’t right. “He will spend hours watching the washing machine and looking at the bubbles or watching the electric sliding doors at our local pool. I even filmed them for him so he can watch the clip at home, which he loves. “Alby is a wonderful boy. Kids love Alby and he has a great set of friends but other parents can be judgemental, which makes me angry. We shouldn’t have to explain Alby’s behaviour to other people – he is just who he is.” Sticking to proper routines and setting boundaries can be challenging too. “His little brother Lenny, who is five, understands when he is being naughty,” says Gethin. “But Alby just doesn’t understand why, for instance, he can’t kick a football around the house. As far as he’s concerned, a ball is a ball whether it’s inside or out.” Unlike many people with autism, Alby’s condition was diagnosed early.   PHGethin was recently made a patron of the Rebounders charityRelated articles   Sesame Street welcomes its first autistic character, Julia, in bid...   Heartwarming moment barber sits on floor to make autistic child... As a physiotherapist working with children, his mother Mererid was quick to seek expert help. Now Alby attends a special unit within a mainstream school. “He has the best of both worlds,” says Gethin. “He has wonderful teachers and friends, yet gets the support he needs too.” Some 34 per cent of children with autism say the worst thing about being at school is being picked on, and 17 per cent have been suspended from school. Only 15 per cent of adults with autism are in full-time paid employment. “Autism is a serious, lifelong and disabling condition,” says Mark. “Without the right support, it can have a profound and sometimes devastating effect on individuals and families. “Early diagnosis is key in order that families get the right support and know what is wrong.“We are concerned, though, that average waiting times of more than three-and-a-half years for children and two years for autistic adults are pushing families to crisis point. Good support from school and family, good peer support and good out-of-school activities can make a huge difference – as can a bit of understanding from the public.”   PHRebounders is a Cardiff-based charity which helps those with additional needs to enjoy exerciseOne activity that has been proven to help children and adults with autism is trampolining. Five years ago Alby started attending Rebounders, a Cardiff-based charity which helps those with additional needs, to improve their mobility, balance and strength through the exercise. “Rebounders is amazing and Alby loves going there,” says Gethin. “He learns his routines on the trampoline and then the kids put on a public performance, which Alby finds challenging because he doesn’t like loud applause.” Set up in 2002 by former accountant Heather Sargent, who had watched on amazed as her daughter Aimee progressed to becoming a Welsh international trampolinist, Rebounders works with small groups of autistic and disabled children and adults.“They learn communication and social skills, including following instructions and taking turns,” explains Heather. “Our instructors have set routines for the children’s first turn and their final turn, so they know when it is time to give someone else a go. “People with autism can take instructions very literally,” she adds. “Telling a child with autism that their turn is finished and they should jump down could mean that they leap from the trampoline, so instead we ask them to use the steps. “Having routines and teaching social skills and sharing, as well as the trampolining skills, means that children and adults thrive – as well as going away with a badge for each new achievement.”   GETTYGethin says his young cousin Alby wants to be a bus driver when he is olderAs Alby’s uncle, Gethin was delighted to become patron of the charity. “I’d do anything for Alby – I’d run the Great Wall Of China for him and never stop for breath. I’d love children of my own and I love being with Alby. “Yet I worry about his future and whether he’ll be able to hold down a job. “But when I asked him what he wants to do, his answer was very simple: ‘A bus driver or work with washing machines’ – just like the woman who runs our local launderette and watches the washing go round all day.” National Lottery players (lotterygoodcauses.org.uk) raise £34 million a week for projects such as the National Autistic Society and Rebounders (rebounderstramp.com). For more information on autism contact the National Autistic Society at www.autism.org.uk or call the helpline on 0808 800 4104.

Our communities and our financial deals, they are no better.""We are a nation of strong hard working people and we will work ourselves great again.""Mr Lines is working in the region to make Britain’s fishing industry prosper after Britain has left the EU.Mr Lines joined fishermen, including Lowestoft fishing boss June Mummery, to create the Renaissance of East Anglian Fishing (Reaf) movement, which pledges to make Lowestoft the hub of fishing in the UK.June Mummery, a founder of BFP Eastern, said: “Lowestoft has been spearheaded to be the renaissance of the East Anglia fisheries, which is Reaf.”She added: “Reaf will be the pilot scheme which will then repatriate the fishing in each coastal community. So we are looking at Lowestoft, for example.“We’d like 20-25 meter boats no bigger than 350 horsepower. 30 of those boats in Lowestoft and 30 in Great Yarmouth and other coastal towns. From that we can then catch the fish, process the fish in this country and then send it back to the EU. If they don’t want it then I’m sure we can send it somewhere else.   “We want to be as great as Norway and Iceland and we have got this time ahead of us to make sure that happens.”When asked what her hopes are for the Brexit end result, Ms Mummery said: “Power to the people. We’ll have our power back. We’ll have our fishing industry back and it’s not just about catching the fish. It’s about processing.“We’ll have factories here – processing the fish and sending it over to Europe and if not to China. And then you’ll have ship-builders.”Ms Mummery insisted Britain does not need the EU in order to succeed, adding: “We just want to take full control of our waters, which is the 200 miles and the fish within it and we can get on with our work. And our work is to build it up.”  Brexit news: Nigel Farage said Britain's fishing industry can prosper after Brexit (Image: Daily Express)She warned: “If Theresa May does not trade us away, we have got a big, big future in this country for fishing.”With herring being at the heart of Lowestoft’s fishing industry for hundreds of years, the region will have the opportunity after Brexit to gain around 36,000 tonnes of herring, worth an estimated £13.5m.Prominent Brexiteer and former Ukip leader Nigel Farage has described June as a “heroin” for her work for Britain’s fishing industry.Mr Farage outlined his hopes for the future of British fishing and said: “All you have to do is look across the North Sea to Norway on the other side. A country that has exactly the same coastal zone and rights as we do but the difference is they claim it and we don’t.“We could be, by taking back our fishing waters and by fishing them sensibly and by putting in place the right environmental controls, we could have an industry worth billions of pounds every year to this country.”Will Masterson, 27, of Lowestoft fish merchants William Masterson & Sons Ltd also spoke of his hopes for the post-Brexit fishing industry. Related articles   May says Sturgeon is BETRAYING SCOTLAND with fishing industry plans   EU 'gross unfairness' will STOP after Brexit claims fisherman Mr Masterson said: “I’m a third generation and it’s coming up for 95 years in the fishing industry. So I want to keep it going.“But as things stand at the minute, with the fishing down here, we do need an economic boost definitely and this could be the way.”The fishing industry boss said Brexit is a “good thing” for the fishing industry. He added: “It’s definitely good for the fishing industry and maybe even for the transport companies and stuff like that because any stuff coming into the ports.“There’s going to be extra for them. It doesn’t just start and stop at the fishing industry. There’s a whole line of work that can be involved.”Lowestoft Resident Alan Boroughs highlighted on the decline to the region’s fishing industry.Mr Boroughs said: “When I first came to Lowestoft the docks down there were absolutely full. Now, they are empty. 30 years later they are empty. I think everything should be for Britain now.”  Brexit news: Paul Lines calls for Britain to get out of EU ""tomorrow"" (Image: Daily Express)  Brexit news: June Mummery said end result of Brexit will be ""power to the people"" (Image: Daily Express)  Brexit news: Britons call for the UK to stop giving money to EU (Image: Daily Express)Despite voting for Remain, resident Mark Williamson is hopeful Brexit will revive Lowestoft’s fishing industry. Mr Williamson said: “It’s about time we got our industry back into this community. Where they used to make all the nets and everything, that’s all derelict and it is all gone.“The fish market is gone and it is not enough. We need to get it back here. It’s about time they did something and give us back our laws and our fishing rights.”But Lowestoft resident Ann Carroll is less hopeful Brexit will provide the town with the opportunity to rejuvenate its fishing industry.Ms Carroll said: “The whole of the industry has geared so that fishing has gone Grimsby and that way and even that is not the size that it was. We will never recover the herring fishing industry here.“I can remember when herring fishing was here and when we had trawlers here and you would have over 100 boats going out of the harbour.”Resident Margaret Lee, who has slowly watched the decline of Britain’s fishing industry said she supported Brexit. She added: “I’m one of the old school I’m afraid and I don’t see why we should be giving money that our country needs to other countries that have probably got more than what we have got.   “And that really annoys me when I think about it.”Michael Hudson from Great Yarmouth called on Mrs May to drop her Chequers proposal. He said: “Definitely not Chequers. Out. A clean exit. Nothing to do with Europe whatsoever apart from trade, obviously.“And they need us more than we need them because there is a huge deficit in their favour so they should be crawling to us and not vice versa.”During Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, the Prime Minister said she “absolutely” recognises the importance of the fishing industry after Brexit.She added: “As we are going through these negotiations we have been very clear that once the EU rules no longer apply to the United Kingdom, we will be an independent coastal state.“And we will be making those decisions. We will be controlling access to our own waters and we will be seeking to gain a fairer share of quotas.”"

Our devices, which can hold their own with other far more expensive laptops, allow someone to create their own technology and discover how to code, in simple steps through storytelling, physical computing and play.” Kano’s global community spans 86 countries, spawned by a different kind of computer company, one with “porous walls” through which some 30 million lines of code have been shared so far, says Klein.“This feeds the development of our physical kits which let you build PCs, screens, speakers, cameras and more, opening up the coding world for art, games, music and interactions online.”The business chose a “complete system strategy because we believe it’s the only way to solve the problem of technological passivity and consumerism,” he continues.   PHKano's latest DIY machines currently cost £112 and £230“For parents, kids, teachers and everyone else what is needed is something made by them, something they can engage with and try before they buy. “Ultimately then they know what is going on in the inside and have control, not just tap, swipe and use. “Our computers engage on average for over 13 hours in the first month alone as new users play with the possibilities of the technology.”It all began with challenge to Klein from a young cousin to make a computer as simple as Lego.After record-breaking £1.1 million crowd-funding launch in 2013 the company has sold more than 200,000 kits, in the process making programming and digital literacy accessible to the least connected or well-off.    PHKano’s global community spans 86 countriesKano was one of the first to be part of and benefit from Launchpad, Amazon’s programme designed to get new products recognition in the global marketplace helping them with e-commerce expertise and marketing. “Through that we could tell our story, reach new customers and expand the brand. The reviews were especially helpful for development ,” says Klein whose co founders are his cousin Saul and entrepreneur Yonatan Raz-Fridman.Its scratch computing approach has proved a star-pleaser too with Apple co-founder and coding supremo Steve Wozniak giving it the thumbs up, musicians Nile Rodgers, Daft Punk and tennis ace Novak Djokovic coming on board for workshops, and the business forging partnerships with governments (notably the US under Obama), and educational institutions. Lead investor is US venture capitalist billionaire Jim Breyer and other UK business heavyweights such as Sir Martin Sorrell and Sherry Coutu.   NCKano's portfolio is a power-grab for the people, making digital democratic and inclusiveThe company, which now employs over 70, harnessed open-source components from the supply chain in China where it manufactures and its latest computer “brain” is the Raspberry Pi 3.As a model it’s fast both getting to market and refreshing the design.“But hardware is hard,” reflects Klein. “For most start-ups it begins with an app, we’re weaving together physical components at the lowest possible price point, workshopped in 10 languages.”The most recent £21 million funding round has been invested in software and low cost kit as it continues its drive lowering barriers to entry.  PHKano is available to anyone, whether you are six or 96, Mr Klein saysKano is also showing Silicon Valley-style success can be a London tech enterprise one too in a city where it finds attitudes favour longer term thinking and there’s a rich pool of talent on hand in the colleges.Now ramping up mass retail and in more than 4,500 stores globally, the company’s plan is to extend its reach through partnerships with big platforms, teaming up with studios and launching in new regions and languages. While the products may well help nurture budding engineers and the next generation land jobs, the prime goal for Kano says Klein is “to give people an enjoyable way to understand how the world around them works so they can express themselves and feel more in control of their future”.The business’s name was inspired by Jigoro Kano, father of the more streamlined modern martial art of judo, and also means ‘I make’ in Greek.  Teacher, tech fear slayer and social bridge, the reasons to have a Kano look set to keep multiplying wherever you are in the world. Amazon Launchpad is a programme designed to help startups with innovative new products and market them to customers across the world.

The next Labour government will have to make cuts too.""Mr Balls also appeared to signal a significant weakening in Labour support for the High Speed 2 project to build a new rail link between London, the Midlands and the north of England, suggesting that the potential £50 billion price-tag might be better spent elsewhere.Repeating his line that, as chancellor, he would not offer a ""blank cheque"" to HS2, he added: ""The question is - not just whether a new high speed line is a good idea or a bad idea, but whether it is the best way to spend £50 billion for the future of our country.""Ed Balls vowed to keep the benefits cap And we will have to govern with less money around. The next Labour government will have to make cuts too.Ed BallsAt a conference which has been overshadowed by reports of feuding between Labour's last generation of leaders, Mr Balls sought to scotch speculation about tension with Ed Miliband by describing the leader as ""my friend, our leader, Britain's next prime minister"" who was ""leading from the front"" on issues ranging from the economy to media regulation.By contrast, he said that Prime Minister David Cameron had ""diminished Britain"" by squandering influence overseas and choking off recovery at home.Mr Balls dismissed as ""nonsense"" Conservative claims of a £27.9 billion ""black hole"" in Labour's spending plans. And he announced that he will ask the Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog to audit Labour's manifesto to confirm that their tax and spend sums add up.He told activists: ""The Government's day-to-day spending totals for 2015/16 will have to be our starting point. Any changes to the current spending plans for that year will be fully funded and set out in advance in our manifesto.""There will be no more borrowing for day-to-day spending. And we will set out tough fiscal rules - to balance the current budget and get the national debt on a downward path.""Of course Labour will always make different choices. We will combine iron discipline on spending control with a fairer approach to deficit reduction.""An incoming Labour government would inherit ""a very difficult situation"" because of Mr Osborne's failure to eliminate the deficit, and would have to show ""fiscal responsibility in the national interest"", said Mr Balls.""At a time when the public services that pensioners rely on are under such pressure, we cannot continue paying the winter fuel allowance to the richest 5% of pensioners,"" he said.""We won't be able to reverse the Government's cuts to child benefit for the highest earners. We will keep the benefits cap, but make sure it properly reflects local housing costs. We will have a cap on structural social security spending.""And yes, over the long-term, as our population ages, there will need to be increases in the retirement age.""But he added: ""A fairer approach to deficit reduction means we will also crack down on tax avoidance , scrap the shares for rights scheme and reverse the tax cut for hedge funds.""And we will insist that all the proceeds from the sale of our stakes in Lloyds and RBS are used not for a one-off pre-election tax giveaway - but instead every penny of profit used to repay the national debt.""Mr Balls said the banks paid a ""staggering"" £2.7 billion less in overall tax last year than they did in 2010, with the Government's bank levy raising £1.6 billion less than predicted over the past two years.""At a time when resources are tight and families are under pressure that cannot be right, he said. ""So I can announce today, the next Labour government will increase the bank levy rate to raise an extra £800 million a year.""And we will use the money, for families where all parents are in work, to increase free childcare places for three and four-year-olds from 15 hours to 25 hours a week.""Ed Balls praised Labour leader Ed Miliband in his speechMr Balls said that a Labour government would seek a ""radical transformation in our economy"" to enable the UK to exploit innovations in high-value manufacturing, digital media, education and medical technology.And he announced that Jaguar Land Rover executive director Mike Wright will lead a review for Labour on strengthening manufacturing supply-chains and delivering the skills and innovation Britain needs to succeed.He rejected coalition claims that the GDP growth recorded in the past few quarters showed that Chancellor George Osborne's economic strategy has worked and he was wrong to call for a ""Plan B"".""After three years of stagnation, it's good news that our economy has finally started to grow again,"" he said. ""It was growing three years ago before they choked it off.""So don't listen to the Tory propaganda that says Labour doesn't want the economy to grow. What nonsense. Because when the economy is in recession we know which communities lose out. When unemployment becomes entrenched, we know which constituencies suffer most. When the cost of living is rising, we know which families are hardest hit.""We know that three years of flat lining - far longer than any of us expected - have caused long-term damage: businesses bankrupt, investment and capacity lost, long-term unemployment entrenched.""And now even as growth finally returns, with prices still rising faster than wages, with business investment still weak, with unemployment still rising in half the country, with bank lending to business still falling, we can't be satisfied.""For millions of families this is no recovery at all. And when around the world emerging markets are jittery, China is slowing, oil prices are rising and the eurozone is still stuck with chronic low growth, I say this is no time for complacency, to sit back with fingers crossed.""Mr Balls warned that a recovery built on rising house prices may not be sustainable and launched a scathing attack on Mr Osborne's Help to Buy scheme to get first-time buyers onto the first rung of the property ladder.""George, it's basic economics,"" he said. ""If you push up housing demand, but don't act to boost housing supply, all that happens is that you push house prices up and up. And the end result is that the very people your policy should be helping - young first time buyers - will find it even harder to get on the housing ladder.""That is why we have consistently said, it is why the IMF (International Monetary Fund) have said, bring forward £10 billion of infrastructure investment right now, build 400,000 affordable houses over the next two years, create half a million jobs and thousands of apprenticeships. That is the way to secure an economy that works for all and is built to last.""Mr Balls' speech was met with a mixed response by business group the Institute of Directors.Director General Simon Walker said: ""I remain concerned by Labour’s proposals to increase the minimum wage in specific sectors, and requiring firms to take on an apprentice for every non-EU worker they hire is a recipe for disaster.""Having said that, Ed Balls engaged with several issues vital to business leaders in his speech. ""We share his concerns about the extended Help to Buy scheme, which risks pushing up house prices while doing little to increase the supply of homes. ""Planning reform is the vital missing element here. There are still too many flaws in the system that hold up home-building. ""It was also significant that he questioned whether HS2 was the best way to spend £50bn. The IoD agrees with Labour that infrastructure investment is essential, but governments must be clear that they are getting value for money.  “Mr Balls’ commitment to discipline in the public finances is welcome, but will require Labour to clamp down on additional spending pledges. ""Their rhetoric must be matched by actions. He should be very wary of attempting to achieve deficit reduction through tax rises, which would be deeply damaging to the recovery.” Related articles   Labour to boost childcare allowance   Balls denies MMR benefit cut report   'Ban tobacco companies from Labour conference' urges Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham "

61,We do not have to listen to Brussels fanatics any more? asks LEO MCKINSTRY,https://www.express.co.uk//comment/columnists/leo-mckinstry/709607/Leo-McKinstry-Brussels-fanatics-comment," 22:31, Sun, Sep 11, 2016 ","  AFP • GETTYThe former Belgian prime minister and EU fanatical Guy VerhofstadtFor the first time in its destructive history Brussels was beaten by the force of national freedom. That is why the European Union has reacted so furiously to the referendum result. The over-paid oligarchs, shaken by the challenge to their rule, have been desperate to stop the spread of liberty to other member states. At the same time they are determined to teach us in Britain a lesson for our impudence by seeking to make the process of withdrawal as painful as possible. As they push for the start of Brexit talks they have chosen a phalanx of aggressive negotiators who are united by their belief in European integration and their disdain for British interests. Heading the team is the former French foreign minister Michel Bernier, who favours bureaucratic intervention over free market capitalism. When he was appointed, one City of London analyst reacted with dismay. “I can’t see how it could be worse. It’s incredibly provocative,” he said.  Related articles   Who is Guy Verhofstadt? Farage's 'enemy' appointed Brexit negotiator   Fury as 'puerile' Brussels makes anti-British chums Brexit negotiators Supporting this Gallic interventionist is Didier Seeuws, a Belgian official who used to be chief of staff to the notorious EU Commission president Herman Van Rompuy, that fervent opponent of traditional nationhood. But when it comes to support for federalism all these ideologues are outclassed by the fanatical Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister. Last week it was announced that Verhofstadt is to be the European Parliament’s lead negotiator on Brexit, a position to which he will bring all his blazing antipathy towards national independence.This is the man who is so immersed in fashionable liberal, anti-Western guilt that after the deadly Islamist attack on Brussels airport this year he blamed the “poverty and unemployment which prevails in so many communities”.   GETTYIf our Government had the guts, they could end the whole fiasco by walking away from negotiationsBut he also exploited the atrocity to demand more political unity. “If we are to defeat those who wish to harm us,” he said, “we need collective European action.” That obsessive focus on federalism is typical of Verhofstadt. A vehement advocate of a United States of Europe he has called for a stronger Brussels executive, an EU army and police force and the creation of an EU-wide tax system.  Lengthy negotiations are unnecessary“Citizens should pay less to their governments and more to the EU,” he says. In all this frenzied rhetoric he cannot hide his disdain for us. Britain without the EU is in fact a dwarf on the world level,” he said. After the referendum he sneered that “Britain has chosen isolation in Europe against the advice of its friends and allies. Its post-imperial decline is complete.” The very idea that we should allow our fate to be dictated by the likes of Verhofstadt and Bernier is grotesque. These federalists want humiliation, not harmony. Verhofstadt has even described us as “an adversary”. But we do not have to allow them to set the agenda. If our new Government under Theresa May had the guts they could instantly end the whole fiasco by walking away from the negotiating table.  What countries are in the EU?

Contrary to what the “Remoaners” and the pro-EU brigade pretend, Brexit does not require years of complex talks by an army of self-important, paper-shuffling officials all eager to justify their existences. The process is not a divorce, as Verhofstadt claims. There are no shared assets, no joint accounts, no mutual obligations. We are simply leaving an absurdly overpriced club. The pretence that we cannot leave without long-winded negotiations is just Project Fear by another name. We could get out immediately if the Government were to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, then pass legislation through Parliament stipulating that British law is sovereign once more. What could the EU do about it? Send in its nonexistent army? Ask Verhofstadt to deliver another of his lectures? It is precisely to stop any backsliding that a new cross-party pressure group called Change Britain has just been established, featuring such heavyweight figures as Michael Gove, the SDP founder David Owen and Labour’s Gisela Stuart, one of the stars of the referendum campaign.   GETTYBoris accepts that the Government has to listen to what the British people said in June   As Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said in a message of support to the group, the Government has to listen to what the British people said in June. “Brexit means delivering on their instructions and restoring UK control over laws, borders, money and trade,” Boris rightly declared. In truth there is nothing to negotiate before we leave. The Remoaners shriek that we must have a trade deal with the EU but this is just more scaremongering. The importance of trade agreements, as shrewd ex-Cabinet minister Peter Lilley has put it, is “grossly exaggerated. Countries succeed with or without them”. Even without any agreement we would – like all other nations – still have full access to the single market, while any tariffs would still be far lower than our former contribution to the EU. We already trade intensively with countries such as the USA, China and India, none of which have concluded a formal deal with us. That trade will expand now we are liberated from Brussels’ misrule. Ours is a bright future. It is Verhofstadt’s sclerotic, doctrinaire EU which is facing decline."

We never celebrate second place here,” read the words of wisdom espoused by Liverpool’s most successful ever manager.There have been other changes during a summer facelift to what Klopp regards as his football HQ while a decision is taken on whether to move to a new purpose-built facility, merge with the academy at nearby Kirkby or invest in a total upgrade.In the players’ dressing room there is a silhouette on the wall of the aftermath of the exhilarating Europa League victory over Borussia Dortmund when Liverpool’s heroes linked arms in a line and celebrated in front of The Kop.A communal area has also been created for the squad to chill out in between, and after, double sessions and foster the spirit required to underpin their efforts.

Outside, a paddle tennis court is in the process of being completed. When Klopp took his squad to Tenerife for a training break last March during international week, he fell in love in the game and requested one be built at Melwood.Some might see it as an indulgence, but it will also double as a head tennis court for the players while offering Klopp somewhere to wind down after long hours and immerse himself in battles with his coaching staff Jon Achterberg, Pep Lijnders and Peter Krawietz. It is therefore a physical and mental stimulant.If changes off the pitch have been plentiful, then the looming trip to Tottenham can act as a neat barometer of progress on the pitch.A lunchtime kick-off on a Saturday at White Hart Lane represents the where and when of Klopp’s formal introduction to the Premier League last October when he offered a first glimpse of his brand of heavy metal football in the match that ended 0-0. In the main, it has been music to supporters’ ears only for a bum note, seemingly out of nowhere, to check momentum and fling Liverpool backwards.

We are still on the way,” said Klopp, acknowledging the need for greater consistency. “The last defeat feels always stronger than the last win.“The players developed in the last few months. You get more experience. It doesn’t mean we are 200pc better. It is just that we feel stronger together and that is a big point.”   var related_quizzes=[{""title"":""How Well Do You Know Arsenal FC?"",""asset"":""https://cdn-arkquizzstoragelive.akamaized.net/cdn/18d954c0-0eb6-4124-84bf-af99bcefa2d7_Arsenal_logo-2[1].jpg"",""redirect"":""http://games.express.co.uk/quiz/?game=trivia_fc-arsenal-quiz""},{""title"":""How Well Do You Know Manchester United?"",""asset"":""https://az831976.vo.msecnd.net/cdn/manchester-united-quiz_manchester_united_wallpapers_02[1].jpg?key=1f495f26-2efd-46d2-927c-9a01c1b8b9e8"",""redirect"":""http://games.express.co.uk/quiz/?game=trivia_manchester-united-quiz""},{""title"":""How Well Do You Know Chelsea FC?"",""asset"":""https://cdn-arkquizzstoragelive.akamaized.net/cdn/c2d1565b-73d3-4835-bc95-e056a48a69d5_Chelsea_Logo_02[1].jpg"",""redirect"":""http://games.express.co.uk/quiz/?game=trivia_chelsea-fc-quiz""}];window.addEventListener(""load"",function(){window.ark_quiz.related(related_quizzes)})Ahead of the return to Tottenham, Klopp has been in charge of 32 Premier League games for Liverpool, winning 14, drawing 9 and losing 9. The results from predecessor Brendan Rodgers’ last 32 games are: W15 D9 L8.There were two Cup Finals as well, albeit losing ones, but while there have been plenty of changes to the squad questions remain as to whether there is the quality to penetrate the league’s upper-reaches.Have Liverpool strengthened enough?Not at left-back, probably not in midfield and we are waiting to find out if they have at goalkeeper following the pre-season injury to Loris Karius.Yet there should be no real surprise Liverpool remain work in progress.Here was a manager seeking to implement a vision and a style of play.  GETTYAlberto Moreno's performance's have been scrutinised of lateNine months does not feel long enough to implement an overhaul, although the work being overseen in Manchester by messrs Mourinho and Guardiola may yet expose that.Liverpool do not have the deep pockets of their rivals but Klopp prefers to do things differently in any case.There were obvious benefits in signing that new six year contract in July, but if he did not believe in the mission he had signed up for.The hope for Liverpool must be that Klopp’s glass-half-full optimism is not misplaced.That his belief that time spent at Melwood, where new fitness coach Andreas Kornmayer and nutritionist Mona Nemmer are already key figures, can smooth away glitches proves correct. That nurture wins the battle over nature.“We have to build on our experience this season and create the future with this team,” said Klopp."

I think it needs to get over its current nervous breakdown and man up a bit.""Once again Ms Davidson was forced to deny she will be switching jobs. She said she is ""regularly behind the door at Number 10"" which means she does not want to take officer. Ms Davidson added: ""It honestly looks like the loneliest job in the world,"" In a reference to the row over Mr Johnson's comments, Ms Davidson - touted as a potential successor to Mrs May - used a conference fringe event to tell her MSPs: ""If any of you think of writing anything, without telling me, that is counter to current Scottish Conservative policy; you are out on your ear because nobody is unsackable.""She said Mr Johnson had insisted that his comments had been in line with Mrs May's policy but added: ""If I was able to interpret the actions, and the thought process behind the actions of the Foreign Secretary, then I think I could make a better living doing that than I do now.""2:26pm update: A conference held by Jacob Rees-Mogg has descended into chaos after protesters mobbed the high-profile backbencher.Demonstrators holding up placards chanted ""Tories out"" at the packed meeting on Brexit.Conservative supporters returned fire, shouting ""Labour scum"".One angry protester told him: “Abortion rights, women’s rights, austerity.. everythng. You’re a despicable person.”To which, Mr Rees-Mogg replied: “Well, we may disagree on things but just because you disagree with somebody, that doesn’t make them a bad person. “The two are separate.” Mr Rees-Mogg was mobbed by a couple of protesters who harangued him directly about his views on abortion.The MP for North East Somerset, speaking from a lectern, appealed for calm. He said:""Ladies and gentlemen, let us have a proper and thoughtful debate.""   GETTY May and her husband clap in applause for Hammond 1:55pm update: Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon joined his Cabinet colleagues in slapping down Mr Johnson, saying he had agreed to a transition period of ""around two years"" at a Cabinet meeting before Mrs May's Florence speech.He dismissed the Foreign Secretary's demand that it should last ""not a second more"" as a ""relatively minor issue"" and stressed ""none of us are unsackable"".Sir Michael told BBC Radio 4's World At One: ""I think some of the noises off actually are about a relatively minor issue about whether the transition period is two years or two years and one month or whatever.""He predicted Mr Johnson would remain loyal in his Tuesday speech to the party conference.Sir Michael said: ""I think you'll find tomorrow, when he speaks to the conference, he will make it very clear that he is party to our negotiations with Europe, he was there at the Cabinet meeting that endorsed the Florence speech, he had every opportunity to contribute to that speech, he agreed then the timetable of around two years.""""And I think you'll find tomorrow he will set out how he wants to help the Prime Minister and the rest of the team achieve a successful Brexit because that's what all of us want, whichever way we voted.""Sir Michael added: ""This Prime Minister has the support of the Parliamentary Party, she has the support of the Cabinet.""Asked if she would last in the job until the next election, he replied: ""I believe so, yes.""1:51pm update: Mr Hammond's speech gained a lukewarm reception from business groups, who welcomed his defence of free markets but said he had failed to deliver enough ""red meat"" on how to revive the economy.CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said: ""Our economy is under threat - it has moved from the top of the G7 to the bottom. The solution must be for responsible business and government to grow our way out of austerity. But this can only happen with clarity, unity and action. Today's speech was only one step in that direction.""And Stephen Martin, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said: ""There was little red meat for business leaders today, and if (the Chancellor) wants to unleash the nation's potential, he must use the Budget to boost investment by individuals and companies.""Shadow chancellor Mr McDonnell said Mr Hammond was ""continuing down the path of his predecessor and clinging to an old economic model that fails the many"".The Chancellor's reliance on ""baseless smears"" against Labour ""betrays how fearful the Tories are of the challenge posed by Jeremy Corbyn"", said Mr McDonnell.Mr Hammond's announcement of £400 million for northern infrastructure was ""a drop in the ocean"" compared with cuts inflicted by his Government, while the extension of Help To Buy would benefit ""only a few"".Mr McDonnell added: ""There was nothing of real substance on infrastructure, on tackling the housing crisis, the funding shortfall in our NHS and care system, and nothing at all for hard-working families who are struggling to keep up with rising prices.""  GETTY Jacob Rees-Mogg is at Monday's Tory party conference 12:38pm update: Hammond has concluded his long-awaited speech by praising the Tories as the ""most successful political organisation in history"". In a rousing speech, the Chancellor promised to deliver to the next generation and “re-fight” a battle to ensure Britain’s prosperity is not at risk. He said: ""So Conference, we will deliver a Brexit that works for Britain and in doing so, we will unleash our nation’s potential.""We have a fundamentally strong economy. We’re rebalancing our public finances. We’re addressing the productivity gap. We’re investing in Britain’s future. But we hear the concerns of a generation that feels excluded from the opportunities their parents enjoyed.""We hear the concerns of millions of households, impatient at the long slog back from Labour’s recession. We hear them and we will respond to them.""But we can only do so by harnessing the power of the market economy to deliver a brighter future. And that means re-fighting a battle we thought we had won against an opposition determined to put Britain’s prosperity at risk.""We will not let that happen. We will not allow Britain’s prosperity to be threatened, our security to be undermined. We will take on the false promises of Corbyn’s Labour and one by one we will expose them for the fallacies that they are. We will not allow the past to triumph over the future. We will not allow the politics of fear to trump the politics of progress.""Conference, the Conservative party is the most successful political organisation in history, flexible and adaptable, responding to a changing world. But resolute and unmoving in its principles and values.""We will see off this threat to our fundamental freedoms. We will deliver on our promise to the next generation.""We will do it together. And we will do it for Britain.""  REUTERS Andrea Leadsom listens to Hammond as he delivers his conference speech 12:37pm: Hammond has praised Mrs May for “substantial achievements” at the election by comparing her to Angela Merkel. He said: ""A Conservative prime minister returned to Number 10 in 2017 with our biggest share of the vote for 30 years. And at 43 per cent, Theresa May won a clearer, stronger mandate in the popular vote in Britain than Angela Merkel in Germany.""12:31pm update: Hammond has now turned to Brexit where he admits the vote has created ""uncertainty"". He called on the Government to remove this uncertainty. He said: ""The process of negotiating our exit from the EU has created uncertainty so investment has slowed as businesses wait for clarity.""So before we can reap the benefits of our strong economic fundamentals and the investment we are making in the future we must remove this uncertainty."" Insisting that Britain has a ""bright future"" ahead, he said the Tory party must be ""clear-eyed"" about the challenges along the way. He told the conference: ""And as we tread that terrain, we need the path well-lit; the hazards well signposted.""The future prize is great.

Our “help to buy ISA”, launched in 2015, has helped more than a million people to save for their own home.""And “Help to Buy: Equity Loan” has achieved much higher take-up than we expected, helping 130,000 families so far with a deposit for their own home.""This morning, the Prime Minister and I have visited two of them in their new home in Salford, hearing first-hand how Help to Buy made their dream of home ownership come true. But that success means the original funding allocated to the scheme will run out before the scheme was expected to end.""So today, I can announce an extra £10bn in funding to provide loans under the scheme through to 2021.

They will receive this advance within five working days.""People with an immediate need will have their payments fast-tracked, Mr Gauke added.He called Universal Credit the most radical reform to welfare since the Second World War, ensuring that work pays for claimants.But the implementation has been criticised by the likes of Dame Louise Casey, the former head of the Government's troubled families team, as well as former Treasury mandarin Lord Macpherson and charity Citizens Advice.Twelve Tory MPs also sent a letter to Mr Gauke urging him to pause the expansion, according to the Daily Telegraph.In his speech, Mr Gauke revealed that twice as many people than originally thought are set to benefit from plans not to reassess people with the most severe conditions for employment and support allowance, the main long-term sickness benefit.He added that 1,800 work coaches had been trained to support claimants with mental health issues, amidst criticism Jobcentre staff found it daunting dealing with them.

68,Theresa May's Brexit speech IN FULL: What the Prime Minister said about her Brexit plan,https://www.express.co.uk//news/politics/755221/Theresa-May-s-Brexit-speech-in-full-what-Prime-Minister-said-EU-exit-plan-Britain," 13:10, Tue, Jan 17, 2017 ","   A little over six months ago, the British people voted for change. They voted to shape a brighter future for our country. They voted to leave the European Union and embrace the world.And they did so with their eyes open: accepting that the road ahead will be uncertain at times, but believing that it leads towards a brighter future for their children - and their grandchildren too.And it is the job of this Government to deliver it. That means more than negotiating our new relationship with the EU.It means taking the opportunity of this great moment of national change to step back and ask ourselves what kind of country we want to be.My answer is clear. I want this United Kingdom to emerge from this period of change stronger, fairer, more united and more outward-looking than ever before.I want us to be a secure, prosperous, tolerant country - a magnet for international talent and a home to the pioneers and innovators who will shape the world ahead.I want us to be a truly Global Britain – the best friend and neighbour to our European partners, but a country that reaches beyond the borders of Europe too.A country that goes out into the world to build relationships with old friends and new allies alike.I want Britain to be what we have the potential, talent and ambition to be. A great, global trading nation that is respected around the world and strong, confident and united at home.  GettyTheresa May gave a historic speech on Britain's exit from the EU todayA Plan for BritainThat is why this Government has a Plan for Britain. One that gets us the right deal abroad but also ensures we get a better deal for ordinary working people at home.It’s why that plan sets out how we will use this moment of change to build a stronger economy and a fairer society by embracing genuine economic and social reform.Why our new Modern Industrial Strategy is being developed, to ensure every nation and area of the United Kingdom can make the most of the opportunities ahead.Why we will go further to reform our schools to ensure every child has the knowledge and the skills they need to thrive in post-Brexit Britain.Why as we continue to bring the deficit down, we will take a balanced approach by investing in our economic infrastructure - because it can transform the growth potential of our economy, and improve the quality of people’s lives across the whole country.   It’s why we will put the preservation of our precious Union at the heart of everything we do. Because it is only by coming together as one great union of nations and people that we can make the most of the opportunities ahead. The result of the referendum was not a decision to turn inward and retreat from the world.Because Britain’s history and culture is profoundly internationalist.We are a European country – and proud of our shared European heritage – but we are also a country that has always looked beyond Europe to the wider world.That is why we are one of the most racially diverse countries in Europe, one of the most multicultural members of the European Union, and why – whether we are talking about India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, America, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, countries in Africa or those that are closer to home in Europe – so many of us have close friends and relatives from across the world.Instinctively, we want to travel to, study in, trade with countries not just in Europe but beyond the borders of our continent.Even now as we prepare to leave the EU, we are planning for the next biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in 2018 – a reminder of our unique and proud global relationships.   A message from Britain to the rest of EuropeAnd it is important to recognise this fact. June the 23rd was not the moment Britain chose to step back from the world. It was the moment we chose to build a truly Global Britain.I know that this – and the other reasons Britain took such a decision – is not always well understood among our friends and allies in Europe. And I know many fear that this might herald the beginning of a greater unravelling of the EU.But let me be clear: I do not want that to happen. It would not be in the best interests of Britain.It remains overwhelmingly and compellingly in Britain’s national interest that the EU should succeed. And that is why I hope in the months and years ahead we will all reflect on the lessons of Britain’s decision to leave.So let me take this opportunity to set out the reasons for our decision and to address the people of Europe directly.It’s not simply because our history and culture is profoundly internationalist, important though that is.Many in Britain have always felt that the United Kingdom’s place in the European Union came at the expense of our global ties, and of a bolder embrace of free trade with the wider world.There are other important reasons too. Our political traditions are different. Unlike other European countries, we have no written constitution, but the principle of Parliamentary Sovereignty is the basis of our unwritten constitutional settlement.We have only a recent history of devolved governance – though it has rapidly embedded itself - and we have little history of coalition government.The public expect to be able to hold their governments to account very directly, and as a result supranational institutions as strong as those created by the European Union sit very uneasily in relation to our political history and way of life. And, while I know Britain might at times have been seen as an awkward member state, the European Union has struggled to deal with the diversity of its member countries and their interests. It bends towards uniformity, not flexibility.David Cameron’s negotiation was a valiant final attempt to make it work for Britain - and I want to thank all those elsewhere in Europe who helped him reach an agreement - but the blunt truth, as we know, is that there was not enough flexibility on many important matters for a majority of British voters.Now I do not believe that these things apply uniquely to Britain. Britain is not the only member state where there is a strong attachment to accountable and democratic government, such a strong internationalist mindset, or a belief that diversity within Europe should be celebrated. And so I believe there is a lesson in Brexit not just for Britain but, if it wants to succeed, for the EU itself.Because our continent’s great strength has always been its diversity.And there are two ways of dealing with different interests. You can respond by trying to hold things together by force, tightening a vice-like grip that ends up crushing into tiny pieces the very things you want to protect.Or you can respect difference, cherish it even, and reform the EU so that it deals better with the wonderful diversity of its member states.So to our friends across Europe, let me say this.Our vote to leave the European Union was no rejection of the values we share. The decision to leave the EU represents no desire to become more distant to you, our friends and neighbours.  It was no attempt to do harm to the EU itself or to any of its remaining member states.We do not want to turn the clock back to the days when Europe was less peaceful, less secure and less able to trade freely.It was a vote to restore, as we see it, our parliamentary democracy, national self-determination, and to become even more global and internationalist in action and in spirit. We will continue to be reliable partners, willing allies and close friends.We want to buy your goods and services, sell you ours, trade with you as freely as possible, and work with one another to make sure we are all safer, more secure and more prosperous through continued friendship.You will still be welcome in this country as we hope our citizens will be welcome in yours.At a time when together we face a serious threat from our enemies, Britain’s unique intelligence capabilities will continue to help to keep people in Europe safe from terrorism.And at a time when there is growing concern about European security, Britain’s servicemen and women, based in European countries including Estonia, Poland and Romania, will continue to do their duty.We are leaving the European Union, but we are not leaving Europe.And that is why we seek a new and equal partnership – between an independent, self-governing, Global Britain and our friends and allies in the EU.Not partial membership of the European Union, associate membership of the European Union, or anything that leaves us half-in, half-out.We do not seek to adopt a model already enjoyed by other countries. We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave.No, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union. And my job is to get the right deal for Britain as we do.Objectives and AmbitionsSo today I want to outline our objectives for the negotiation ahead. 12 objectives that amount to one big goal: a new, positive and constructive partnership between Britain and the European Union.And as we negotiate that partnership, we will be driven by some simple principles: we will provide as much certainty and clarity as we can at every stage.And we will take this opportunity to make Britain stronger, to make Britain fairer, and to build a more Global Britain too.  GettyTheresa May gave the speech at Lancaster House in LondonCertainty and clarity1. CertaintyThe first objective is crucial. We will provide certainty wherever we can.We are about to enter a negotiation. That means there will be give and take. There will have to be compromises. It will require imagination on both sides. And not everybody will be able to know everything at every stage.But I recognise how important it is to provide business, the public sector, and everybody with as much certainty as possible as we move through the process.So where we can offer that certainty, we will do so. That is why last year we acted quickly to give clarity about farm payments and university funding. And it is why, as we repeal the European Communities Act, we will convert the “acquis” – the body of existing EU law – into British law.This will give the country maximum certainty as we leave the EU. The same rules and laws will apply on the day after Brexit as they did before. And it will be for the British Parliament to decide on any changes to that law after full scrutiny and proper Parliamentary debate.And when it comes to Parliament, there is one other way in which I would like to provide certainty. I can confirm today that the Government will put the final deal that is agreed between the UK and the EU to a vote in both Houses of Parliament, before it comes into force.A Stronger BritainOur second guiding principle is to build a stronger Britain.2. Control of our own lawsThat means taking control of our own affairs, as those who voted in their millions to leave the European Union demanded we must.So we will take back control of our laws and bring an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in Britain. Leaving the European Union will mean that our laws will be made in Westminster, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. And those laws will be interpreted by judges not in Luxembourg but in courts across this country.Because we will not have truly left the European Union if we are not in control of our own laws.3. Strengthen the UnionA stronger Britain demands that we do something else - strengthen the precious union between the four nations of the United Kingdom.At this momentous time, it is more important than ever that we face the future together, united by what makes us strong: the bonds that unite us as a people, and our shared interest in the UK being an open, successful trading nation in the future.And I hope that same spirit of unity will apply in Northern Ireland in particular over the coming months in the Assembly elections, and the main parties there will work together to re-establish a partnership government as soon as possible.Foreign affairs are of course the responsibility of the UK Government, and in dealing with them we act in the interests of all parts of the United Kingdom. As Prime Minister, I take that responsibility seriously.I have also been determined from the start that the devolved administrations should be fully engaged in this process.That is why the Government has set up a Joint Ministerial Committee on EU Negotiations, so ministers from each of the UK’s devolved administrations can contribute to the process of planning for our departure from the European Union.We have already received a paper from the Scottish Government, and look forward to receiving a paper from the Welsh Government shortly.Both papers will be considered as part of this important process. We won’t agree on everything, but I look forward to working with the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to deliver a Brexit that works for the whole of the United Kingdom.Part of that will mean working very carefully to ensure that – as powers are repatriated from Brussels back to Britain – the right powers are returned to Westminster, and the right powers are passed to the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.As we do so, our guiding principle must be to ensure that - as we leave the European Union - no new barriers to living and doing business within our own Union are created,That means maintaining the necessary common standards and frameworks for our own domestic market, empowering the UK as an open, trading nation to strike the best trade deals around the world, and protecting the common resources of our islands.And as we do this, I should equally be clear that no decisions currently taken by the devolved administrations will be removed from them.4. Maintain the Common Travel Area with IrelandWe cannot forget that, as we leave, the United Kingdom will share a land border with the EU, and maintaining that Common Travel Area with the Republic of Ireland will be an important priority for the UK in the talks ahead.There has been a Common Travel Area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland for many years. Indeed, it was formed before either of our two countries were members of the European Union. And the family ties and bonds of affection that unite our two countries mean that there will always be a special relationship between us. So we will work to deliver a practical solution that allows the maintenance of the Common Travel Area with the Republic, while protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom’s immigration system.Nobody wants to return to the borders of the past, so we will make it a priority to deliver a practical solution as soon as we can.    A Fairer BritainThe third principle is to build a fairer Britain. That means ensuring it is fair to everyone who lives and works in this country.5. Control of immigrationAnd that is why we will ensure we can control immigration to Britain from Europe. We will continue to attract the brightest and the best to work or study in Britain – indeed openness to international talent must remain one of this country’s most distinctive assets – but that process must be managed properly so that our immigration system serves the national interest.So we will get control of the number of people coming to Britain from the EU.Because while controlled immigration can bring great benefits – filling skills shortages, delivering public services, making British businesses the world-beaters they often are – when the numbers get too high, public support for the system falters. In the last decade or so, we have seen record levels of net migration in Britain, and that sheer volume has put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing, and put a downward pressure on wages for working class people.As Home Secretary for six years, I know that you cannot control immigration overall when there is free movement to Britain from Europe.Britain is an open and tolerant country.We will always want immigration, especially high-skilled immigration, we will always want immigration from Europe, and we will always welcome individual migrants as friends.  But the message from the public before and during the referendum campaign was clear: Brexit must mean control of the number of people who come to Britain from Europe. And that is what we will deliver.6. Rights for EU nationals in Britain, and British nationals in the EUFairness demands that we deal with another issue as soon as possible too. We want to guarantee the rights of EU citizens who are already living in Britain, and the rights of British nationals in other member states, as early as we can. I have told other EU leaders that we could give people the certainty they want straight away, and reach such a deal now.   Many of them favour such an agreement - one or two others do not - but I want everyone to know that it remains an important priority for Britain – and for many other member states – to resolve this challenge as soon as possible. Because it is the right and fair thing to do. 7. Protect workers’ rightsAnd a fairer Britain is a country that protects and enhances the rights people have at work.That is why, as we translate the body of European law into our domestic regulations, we will ensure that workers rights are fully protected and maintained. Indeed, under my leadership, not only will the Government protect the rights of workers’ set out in European legislation, we will build on them.Because under this Conservative Government, we will make sure legal protection for workers keeps pace with the changing labour market – and that the voices of workers are heard by the boards of publicly-listed companies for the first time.   A Truly Global BritainBut the great prize for this country – the opportunity ahead – is to use this moment to build a truly Global Britain. A country that reaches out to old friends and new allies alike. A great, global, trading nation. And one of the firmest advocates for free trade anywhere in the world.8. Free trade with European marketsThat starts with our close friends and neighbours in Europe. So as a priority, we will pursue a bold and ambitious Free Trade Agreement with the European Union.This agreement should allow for the freest possible trade in goods and services between Britain and the EU’s member states. It should give British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate within European markets – and let European businesses do the same in Britain.But I want to be clear. What I am proposing cannot mean membership of the  Single Market.European leaders have said many times that membership means accepting the “four freedoms” of goods, capital, services and people.And being out of the EU but a member of the Single Market would mean complying with the EU’s rules and regulations that implement those freedoms, without having a vote on what those rules and regulations are.It would mean accepting a role for the European Court of Justice that would see it still having direct legal authority in our country.It would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all. And that is why both sides in the referendum campaign made it clear that a vote to leave the EU would be a vote to leave the Single Market.So we do not seek membership of the Single Market. Instead we seek the greatest possible access to it through a new, comprehensive, bold and ambitious Free Trade Agreement.That Agreement may take in elements of current Single Market arrangements in certain areas – on the export of cars and lorries for example, or the freedom to provide financial services across national borders – as it makes no sense to start again from scratch when Britain and the remaining Member States have adhered to the same rules for so many years.But I respect the position taken by European leaders who have been clear about their position, just as I am clear about mine. So an important part of the new strategic partnership we seek with the EU will be the pursuit of the greatest possible access to the Single Market, on a fully reciprocal basis, through a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement.And because we will no longer be members of the Single Market, we will not be required to contribute huge sums to the EU budget. There may be some specific European programmes in which we might want to participate.If so, and this will be for us to decide, it is reasonable that we should make an appropriate contribution. But the principle is clear: the days of Britain making vast contributions to the European Union every year will end.  9. New trade agreements with other countriesBut it is not just trade with the EU we should be interested in. A Global Britain must be free to strike trade agreements with countries from outside the European Union too.Because important though our trade with the EU is and will remain, it is clear that the UK needs to increase significantly its trade with the fastest growing export markets in the world.Since joining the EU, trade as a percentage of GDP has broadly stagnated in the UK. That is why it is time for Britain to get out into the world and rediscover its role as a great, global, trading nation. This is such a priority for me that when I became Prime Minister I established, for the first time, a Department for International Trade, led by Liam Fox.We want to get out into the wider world, to trade and do business all around the globe. Countries including China, Brazil, and the Gulf States have already expressed their interest in striking trade deals with us. We have started discussions on future trade ties with countries like Australia, New Zealand and India. And President Elect Trump has said Britain is not “at the back of the queue” for a trade deal with the United States, the world’s biggest economy, but front of the line.I know my emphasis on striking trade agreements with countries outside Europe has led to questions about whether Britain seeks to remain a member of the EU’s Customs Union. And it is true that full Customs Union membership prevents us from negotiating our own comprehensive trade deals.Now, I want Britain to be able to negotiate its own trade agreements. But I also want tariff-free trade with Europe and cross-border trade there to be as frictionless as possible.That means I do not want Britain to be part of the Common Commercial Policy and I do not want us to be bound by the Common External Tariff.  These are the elements of the Customs Union that prevent us from striking our own comprehensive trade agreements with other countries. But I do want us to have a customs agreement with the EU.Whether that means we must reach a completely new customs agreement, become an associate member of the Customs Union in some way, or remain a signatory to some elements of it, I hold no preconceived position.I have an open mind on how we do it. It is not the means that matter, but the ends. And those ends are clear: I want to remove as many barriers to trade as possible.And I want Britain to be free to establish our own tariff schedules at the World Trade Organisation, meaning we can reach new trade agreements not just with the European Union but with old friends and new allies from outside Europe too.10. The best place for science and innovationA Global Britain must also be a country that looks to the future. That means being one of the best places in the world for science and innovation.One of our great strengths as a nation is the breadth and depth of our academic and scientific communities, backed up by some of the world’s best universities. And we have a proud history of leading and supporting cutting-edge research and innovation.So we will also welcome agreement to continue to collaborate with our European partners on major science, research, and technology initiatives.From space exploration to clean energy to medical technologies, Britain will remain at the forefront of collective endeavours to better understand, and make better, the world in which we live.   11. Cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorismAnd a Global Britain will continue to cooperate with its European partners in important areas such as crime, terrorism and foreign affairs.All of us in Europe face the challenge of cross-border crime, a deadly terrorist threat, and the dangers presented by hostile states. All of us share interests and values in common, values we want to see projected around the world.With the threats to our common security becoming more serious, our response cannot be to cooperate with one another less, but to work together more.I therefore want our future relationship with the European Union to include practical arrangements on matters of law enforcement and the sharing of intelligence material with our EU allies.I am proud of the role Britain has played and will continue to play in promoting Europe’s security.Britain has led Europe on the measures needed to keep our continent secure – whether it is implementing sanctions against Russia following its action in Crimea, working for peace and stability in the Balkans, or securing Europe’s external border.We will continue to work closely with our European allies in foreign and defence policy even as we leave the EU itself.A phased approach12. A smooth, orderly BrexitThese are our objectives for the negotiation ahead – objectives that will help to realise our ambition of shaping that stronger, fairer, Global Britain that we want to see.They are the basis for a new, strong, constructive partnership with the European Union – a partnership of friends and allies, of interests and values. A partnership for a strong EU and a strong UK. But there is one further objective we are setting. For as I have said before – it is in no one’s interests for there to be a cliff-edge for business or a threat to stability, as we change from our existing relationship to a new partnership with the EU. By this, I do not mean that we will seek some form of unlimited transitional status, in which we find ourselves stuck forever in some kind of permanent political purgatory. That would not be good for Britain, but nor do I believe it would be good for the EU.Instead, I want us to have reached an agreement about our future partnership by the time the two-year Article Fifty process has concluded. From that point onwards, we believe a phased process of implementation, in which both Britain and the EU institutions and member states prepare for the new arrangements that will exist between us will be in our mutual self-interest.This will give businesses enough time to plan and prepare for those new arrangements. This might be about our immigration controls, customs systems or the way in which we cooperate on criminal justice matters. Or it might be about the future legal and regulatory framework for financial services. For each issue, the time we need to phase-in the new arrangements may differ.Some might be introduced very quickly, some might take longer. And the interim arrangements we rely upon are likely to be a matter of negotiation.But the purpose is clear: we will seek to avoid a disruptive cliff-edge, and we will do everything we can to phase in the new arrangements we require as Britain and the EU move towards our new partnership.The Right Deal for BritainSo, these are the objectives we have set. Certainty wherever possible. Control of our own laws. Strengthening the United Kingdom.Maintaining the Common Travel Area with Ireland. Control of immigration. Rights for EU nationals in Britain, and British nationals in the EU.Enhancing rights for workers. Free trade with European markets. New trade agreements with other countries. A leading role in science and innovation.Cooperation on crime, terrorism and foreign affairs. And a phased approach, delivering a smooth and orderly Brexit.This is the framework of a deal that will herald a new partnership between the UK and the EU. It is a comprehensive and carefully considered plan that focuses on the ends, not just the means - with its eyes fixed firmly on the future, and on the kind of country we will be once we leave.It reflects the hard work of many in this room today who have worked tirelessly to bring it together and to prepare this country for the negotiation ahead.And it will, I know, be debated and discussed at length.That is only right. But those who urge us to reveal more – such as the blow-by-blow details of our negotiating strategy, the areas in which we might compromise, the places where we think there are potential trade-offs – will not be acting in the national interest. Because this is not a game or a time for opposition for opposition’s sake.It is a crucial and sensitive negotiation that will define the interests and the success of our country for many years to come. And it is vital that we maintain our discipline.That is why I have said before – and will continue to say – that every stray word and every hyped up media report is going to make it harder for us to get the right deal for Britain. Our opposite numbers in the European Commission know it, which is why they are keeping their discipline. And the ministers in this Government know it too, which is why we will also maintain ours. So however frustrating some people find it, the Government will not be pressured into saying more than I believe it is in our national interest to say. Because it is not my job to fill column inches with daily updates, but to get the right deal for Britain. And that is what I intend to do.   A new partnership between Britain and EuropeI am confident that a deal - and a new strategic partnership between the UK and the EU – can be achieved.This is firstly because, having held conversations with almost every leader from every single EU member state; having spent time talking to the senior figures from the European institutions, including President Tusk, President Juncker, and President Schulz; and after my Cabinet colleagues David Davis, Philip Hammond and Boris Johnson have done the same with their interlocutors, I am confident that the vast majority want a positive relationship between the UK and the EU after Brexit.And I am confident that the objectives I am setting out today are consistent with the needs of the EU and its Member States.That is why our objectives include a proposed Free Trade Agreement between Britain and the European Union, and explicitly rule out membership of the EU’s Single Market. Because when the EU’s leaders say they believe the four freedoms of the Single Market are indivisible, we respect that position.When the 27 Member States say they want to continue their journey inside the European Union, we not only respect that fact but support it.  Because we do not want to undermine the Single Market, and we do not want to undermine the European Union. We want the EU to be a success and we want its remaining member states to prosper. And of course we want the same for Britain.And the second reason I believe it is possible to reach a good deal is that the kind of agreement I have described today is the economically rational thing that both Britain and the EU should aim for.  Because trade is not a zero sum game: more of it makes us all more prosperous.Free trade between Britain and the European Union means more trade, and more trade means more jobs and more wealth creation. The erection of new barriers to trade, meanwhile, means the reverse: less trade, fewer jobs, lower growth.The third and final reason I believe we can come to the right agreement is that cooperation between Britain and the EU is needed not just when it comes to trade but when it comes to our security too. Britain and France are Europe’s only two nuclear powers. We are the only two European countries with permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. Britain’s armed forces are a crucial part of Europe’s collective defence.  What Theresa May's 12-point Brexit plan really means Mon, January 16, 2017It's finally here.

It is in Europe’s interests. And it is in the interests of the wider world.But I must be clear. Britain wants to remain a good friend and neighbour to Europe.  Yet I know there are some voices calling for a punitive deal that punishes Britain and discourages other countries from taking the same path.That would be an act of calamitous self-harm for the countries of Europe. And it would not be the act of a friend.Britain would not – indeed we could not – accept such an approach. And while I am confident that this scenario need never arise – while I am sure a positive agreement can be reached – I am equally clear that no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain.Because we would still be able to trade with Europe. We would be free to strike trade deals across the world. And we would have the freedom to set the competitive tax rates and embrace the policies that would attract the world’s best companies and biggest investors to Britain.And – if we were excluded from accessing the Single Market – we would be free to change the basis of Britain’s economic model.But for the EU, it would mean new barriers to trade with one of the biggest economies in the world.It would jeopardise investments in Britain by EU companies worth more than half a trillion pounds. It would mean a loss of access for European firms to the financial services of the City of London.It would risk exports from the EU to Britain worth around £290 billion every year. And it would disrupt the sophisticated and integrated supply chains upon which many EU companies rely.Important sectors of the EU economy would also suffer. We are a crucial – profitable – export market for Europe’s automotive industry, as well as sectors including energy, food and drink, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture. These sectors employ millions of people around Europe.And I do not believe that the EU’s leaders will seriously tell German exporters, French farmers, Spanish fishermen, the young unemployed of the Eurozone, and millions of others, that they want to make them poorer, just to punish Britain and make a political point.For all these reasons – and because of our shared values and the spirit of goodwill that exists on both sides – I am confident that we will follow a better path. I am confident that a positive agreement can be reached.It is right that the Government should prepare for every eventuality - but to do so in the knowledge that a constructive and optimistic approach to the negotiations to come is in the best interests of Europe and the best interests of Britain.   ConclusionWe do not approach these negotiations expecting failure, but anticipating success.Because we are a great, global nation with so much to offer Europe and so much to offer the world.One of the world’s largest and strongest economies. With the finest intelligence services, the bravest armed forces, the most effective hard and soft power, and friendships, partnerships and alliances in every continent.   And another thing that’s important. The essential ingredient of our success. The strength and support of 65 million people willing us to make it happen.Because after all the division and discord, the country is coming together.The referendum was divisive at times. And those divisions have taken time to heal.But one of the reasons that Britain’s democracy has been such a success for so many years is that the strength of our identity as one nation, the respect we show to one another as fellow citizens, and the importance we attach to our institutions means that when a vote has been held we all respect the result.The victors have the responsibility to act magnanimously. The losers have the responsibility to respect the legitimacy of the outcome. And the country comes together. And that is what we are seeing today. Business isn’t calling to reverse the result, but planning to make a success of it. The House of Commons has voted overwhelmingly for us to get on with it. And the overwhelming majority of people – however they voted – want us to get on with it too.So that is what we will do.Not merely forming a new partnership with Europe, but building a stronger, fairer, more Global Britain too.And let that be the legacy of our time. The prize towards which we work. The destination at which we arrive once the negotiation is done.And let us do it not for ourselves, but for those who follow. For the country’s children and grandchildren too. So that when future generations look back at this time, they will judge us not only by the decision that we made, but by what we made of that decision.They will see that we shaped them a brighter future.They will know that we built them a better Britain."

The growing concern over the impasse and the prospect of another Scottish independence vote has caused the pound to suffer. On Wednesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced plans for a fresh independence poll before May 2021.  Related articles   May sets new deadline with Britons to vote in EU elections – ‘GREAT...   ‘Arrogant and DISHONEST’ - Farage TAUNTS Adonis Chris Turner, head of foreign exchange strategy at ING, said: “Renewed debate about the choice of currency for an independent Scotland will rekindle uncertainty. Sterling risks $1.2800 in the current strong dollar environment.”Sterling edged 0.3 percent higher to $1.2932, its weakest since mid-February, and it traded flat at 86.3 pence against the euro. On a weekly basis, it is set to decline 0.6 percent, which represents its biggest loss in four weeks. The dollar, which rose towards a two-year high on an index of major currencies, also weighed on the pound.  The British pound is heading for its biggest weekly drop in a month as the Brexit deadlock drags on (Image: GETTY )Scots rejected independence in a 2014 referendum and since then support has stuck at around 45 percent, according to opinion polls.On Friday, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage sent shockwaves through Westminster after he confirmed his Brexit Party will stand at the next general election.Mr Farage has pledged to replace MPs who fail to deliver upon the will of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the bloc.He has stated his intentions to use the upcoming European Parliament elections as a “springboard” to deliver “massive change” in British politics.

Mr Starmer said the New IRA's apology was 'completely despicable' (Image: GETTY)8.17pm update: Gavin Esler says if government delivers Brexit Britain will become ‘Trumpland’Ex-BBC presenter Gavin Esler who is standing as an MEP for the Remain-backing party Change UK said if the government delivers Brexit it would turn Britain into “a kind of Trumpland’. The former journalist who spent 40 years working for the BBC joins Rachel Johnson, the sister of future Tory leadership hopeful Boris, on the field of candidates put forward by Change UK, just two months after the group was set up. The party which has dubbed itself the “Remain Alliance” is contesting all 70 seats in Britain. Mr Esler, 66, is determined to help his new party prevent the UK from leaving the EU. In an interview with the Evening Standard, Mr Esler, said: “If you let people who have proved to be not telling the truth and (who are) incompetent get away with Brexit, then we are entering a kind of Trumpland.”Change UK was set up in February by seven MPs who defected from the Labour Party. They were later joined by another Labour MP and three Tory MPs. One of the group’s main aims is to “stop Brexit”.   Mr Esler, 66, delivers a speech at Change UK's launch of its European election campaign (Image: GETTY)4.10pm update: Brexit will not give rise to white supremacy in UK, says pro-diversity groupBritain’s departure from the EU will not give rise to white supremacy, a pro-diverse group of writers have said. All in Britain, which comprises people from different ethnic and social backgrounds, said in a statement it is high time the UK woke up to the fact that many BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) voters want to sever ties with Brussels. The group seized on Channel 4’s presenter Jon Snow’s comments when he said “I have never seen so many white people in one place” while covering a Leave Means Leave rally. All in Britain said: “He was signalling to his audience that there is an inherent racism in the Leave vote, and by implication, the direction that Britain is heading in.” The group called for people to acknowledge and admit the presence of BAME voters among the 17.1 million who voted to divorce from the EU. The group also praised Nigel Farage for fielding a diverse array of candidates in next month’s EU elections. In a statement released on Friday it said: “The Brexit Party list looks remarkably ethnically diverse, especially when compared to that of the Remain-oriented, Change UK. “Whatever you think of Brexit as a policy decision for the country, surely the sight of so many articulate and committed BME Brexiteers is enough to shake the certainty that leaving the EU represents the rise of white supremacy in Britain.”  All in Britain said Leave voters were not only white but many BAME voters wanted Brexit also (Image: GETTY)3.45pm update: Economist warns UK must be far away from EU when ‘bomb explodes’A German economist has warned Britain should be far away from the EU when an economic “bomb” explodes which he predicts will happen in the future. In an interview with RT Deutsch, Dr Markus Krall said if he was British he would have voted for Brexit as it is the most “logical” decision. Dr Krall blamed the European Central Bank for creating a “big and pretty powerful monetary bomb” by its policies. He said: “One should be far, far away when the bomb explodes, which is what the Brits are doing at the moment.“The monetary bomb the ECB has created for us is unfortunately pretty big and pretty powerful, also because they have been working on it for a long time.”  Dr Krall said if he was British he would have voted for Brexit (Image: NC)3.20pm update: Nearly 600 candidates running in EU elections The number of candidates standing in the EU elections is 31 percent higher than the last time Great Britain took part in the polls in 2014. A total of 580 people are running as MEPs in the May 23 European parliament elections - up from 442 five years ago. All 70 seats across Britain are being contested by the country’s newest parties - Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party and Change UK - as well as the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and UKIP. The SNP are fielding candidates for all Scottish seats while Plaid Cymru is contesting all seats in Wales. The Women's Equality Party, which did not take part in the 2014 EU polls, has put forward candidates for the eight seats in London.The Yorkshire Party, which also did not stand in 2014, is contesting the six seats in Yorkshire & the Humber.But the English Democrats Party has significantly reduced the amount of candidates it is fielding this year, having put forward just 12 people, down from 60 which it fielded in the elections five years ago. The seats are divided between 11 regions which vary in size from three seats to 10.   Nearly 600 candidates are running for seats across Britain in the EU elections (Image: GETTY)1.00pm update: Gibraltar glee at Brexit chaos: Rock's chief vows to get 'WASTED' if EU exit blockedGibraltar’s chief minister has vowed to celebrate with his Spanish allies if Brexit is blocked as he called for a “second chance” for Britain to remain in the EU.The Rock’s chief minister Fabian Picardo said Brexit “is more stalled than we could imagine” as he predicted Britain’s exit from the Brussels club could be stopped altogether.Describing his relief if Britain remained in the EU, he joked: “If there is no Brexit I will get so wasted and I will invite the mayor of La Línea and my friends from here and from Gibraltar to celebrate with me.”12.15pm: Cable slaps down Change UK party -

But if this occurs for any reason, it would be likely that no UK operators would be able to take coach services into the EU at least in the short term.""UK operators who are taking travel bookings which involve coach travel in Europe after 29 March 2019 may wish to consider contractual terms with their customers that allow them to subcontract all or part of the coach travel to EU-based operators if necessary.""The notice adds the UK will allow EU buses and coaches to continue brigning passengers into and out of the UK to minimise any disruption to them.Operators have also been warned there could be new requirements at borders with the EU, as well as impacts for coaches using EU ports. The notice says: ""In the event of delays, caused by increased checks at EU ports, the UK Government would implement contingency arrangements to manage the flow of traffic.""5.35pm update: Pet owners could face months of preparation for travel under no-dealPet owners wanting to travel with their pets around Europe could face months of preparation before their trip. If the UK did become a ""listed"" third country, there would be little change in pet travel arrangements but if it becomes an ""unlisted"" country, there could be a four month wait to secure a health certificate to prove pets are vaccinated for rabies. Pets that have a blood titre test, which showas they have enough of the rabies antibody, as well as those with the latest vaccinations would not have to have another test beforew traveling. But those without this would need to be vaccinated and then wait 30 days before having the blood test, with a further three-month wait before they can travel to the EU. Pet owners would then have to get a health certificate issued by their vet for every trip to the EU, within 10 days before travel.    Theresa May insists she has ""put forward a credible proposal"" to exit the EU (Image: GETTY)5.25pm update: Business leaders reiterate damage no-deal Brexit would haveBusiness leaders have again outlined the potential damages Britain leaving the EU without a Brexit deal could have on several industry sectors. Food and Drink Federeation chief executive Ian Wright claimed his industry would be hit by ""ever more"" administrative burdens. He said: ""Our politicians act as if they have six more months to conclude a withdrawal agreement.""In fact, today's official confirmation of just how bad this scenario would be is bound to encourage businesses and shoppers to consider - now - stockpiling, buying ahead, hedging currency risk, procuring additional warehousing, relocating production to the EU, and other practical measures to secure supply.""These actions in turn will increase prices and begin to distort markets immediately.""The consequences of a no-deal Brexit for UK food and drink are starting to be felt already. The impacts will snowball as we get closer to March 2019.""Instead of lecturing the EU, the Government must secure a withdrawal agreement imminently or begin the arrangements to extend the Article 50 deadline so that they can do so in an orderly fashion.""Mike Spicer of the British Chambers of Commerce said: ""While some businesses will be reassured by some of the details in these notices, such as around IP protection and geographical indications, the admission that loss of market access is a possibility for others will be deeply unsettling to those affected.""There will be major concerns in industries like aviation and road haulage, that operate routinely across borders at European scale, that their markets will be fragmented by new licensing or regulatory frameworks.""Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said: ""Last week's summit in Salzburg laid bare the volatility of the current Brexit negotiations and has heightened concerns among our small businesses whose confidence has already dipped into negative territory.""These worries would have only intensified after studying the latest Government no-deal technical notes. So far, the Government has released three tranches of information that have really made clear that a chaotic no-deal Brexit will be damaging and dangerous for our small firms.""Many smaller firms rely on hauliers for delivering goods across the EU and for bringing goods in. A no-deal Brexit could pose a real threat to these businesses as EU community licences issued by the UK might not be automatically recognised by the EU.""5.15pm update: Britain won't flinch in impasse with EU, warns Raab Dominic Raab warned the EU that Britain will not flinch in an impasse with it over a Brexit deal. Speaking to the BBC after a Cabinet meeting, he said: “We had a good healthy discussion.“The Prime Minister made clear we're going to keep our calm, hold our nerve and press the EU on some of the criticisms that they've made, but also to be clear that there are no credible alternatives that the EU has come up with.”   5pm update: Pound bounces back following Raab's Brexit deal commentsThe pound has staged a recovery after huge falls last week, rising 0.7 percent to reach $1.3167 and 0.3 percent against the euro to 89.37 pence. On Friday, the British currency tumbled two cents against the US dollar - its biggest daily drop this year - after Theresa May said Brexit talks had reached an impasse. Earlier today, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said he was still confident Britain can still react a deal with the EU. But analysts warned those comments were unlikely to support the currency for long, with the Prime Minister's leadership under increasing pressure ahead of the Conservative Party Conference this week.Deutsche Bank currency strategist George Saravelos wrote in a note to clients: ""An aggressive stance from the EU and the subsequent backlash from Theresa May increases the probability that a confrontation builds through the conference.""4.50pm update: Government stands firm on Common Travel Area (CTA)One of the Government's technical no-deal notices has outlined that British and Irish citizens will be able to continue traveling freely within the CTA without seeking immigration permission. It says: ""The CTA holds special importance to people in their daily lives, it goes to the heart of the relationship between these islands.""The UK Government is firmly committed to maintaining the CTA arrangements after the UK leaves the EU, an objective shared by the Crown Dependencies.""The Irish Government has been clear also in its commitment to the continuation of the CTA.

This is where the Brexit prize lies.""Moving forward on the unilateral, bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral pillars at the same time will maximise the UK's gains, and also maximise it chances of a good agreement with the EU.""We have looked at Brexit in the wrong way, and in so doing we have hampered our ability to get a good deal with the EU.

The European Union wants Northern Ireland to remain under the same rules as the Republic of Ireland, which the UK says is unworkable as it would put a border in the Irish Sea.Theresa May’s proposals would see the UK sign a treaty to guarantee harmonisation with EU rules.The UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods coming in to the UK but destined for the EU.  The Labour Party Conference is being held in Liverpool this week (Image: GETTY)9.15am update: Alternative Brexit plan orders UK to start negotiating trade deals with the USThe Institute of Economic Affairs urges ministers to break the deadlock in negotiations with Brussels by seeking a ""basic"" free trade agreement for goods.At the same time, it says the Government should open simultaneous discussions on securing new long-term free trade deals with countries such as the United States, China and India.The full plan will be launched later today with former Brexit Secretary David Davis, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group speaking.9am update: Alternative Brexit plan has been released - what does it say?The free market think tank Institute of Economic Affairs believes that the UK will not be able to reap the full awards of leaving the EU unless it abandons Theresa May’s Chequers plan.The report, which has been backed by prominent Tory Brexiteers, advises ministers to break the deadlock in negotiations with Brussels by seeking a “basic” free trade agreement for goods.The report said: “The UK running its own economy will not render a deal with the EU impossible.“It will bring back real growth, let the UK do other trade deals, and create leverage to get positive results from EU negotiations.""Political, trade, and regulatory independence is therefore not just an ideological position, but what makes the gains possible.9am update: Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says he was likely to vote against any Brexit secured by Theresa MayMr McDonnell told LBC: ""On the deal that is likely to come out of Brussels under Theresa May at the moment, I can't see what she has proposed so far would protect jobs and the economy and I would vote against it and I'll vote against it in Parliament as well.""But we'll see what she comes back with. Things might change, I can't see it though at the moment.""It doesn't look good in terms of the proposals that she put forward, I just don't think they are workable.""Mr McDonell has suggested that the second referendum that the Labour Party want would not include an option to remain in the EU.

Military experts give their viewsFormer head of the British Army Lord Dannatt said it was ""wholly right"" that Syria was subject to sanctions from the UK, US and France following the ""appalling"" use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime.He added inaction would have made the West look weak.Lord West, former head of the Royal Navy, also praised the West’s decision saying military action “had to be taken” and further action would be a “great big hammer” instead of a “pinprick”.But Professor Michael Clarke, counter-terrorism and defence expert, warns that retaliation could come in the form of “cyber warfare” - within the next two to three weeks.He said: ”I suspect Russia will choose not to respond in military terms. But cyber warfare is highly likely.""""It will be an attack on national infrastructure, not just upsetting city firms, but getting inside the transport system, or the health system, or air traffic control.

His anger should be a cause for celebration across this House.”5pm update: HUGE time May has spent in Commons debating and answering questions REVEALEDTheresa May has spent more than 18 hours in the chamber debating and answering questions from MPs since the Commons returned last month following the party conference season. A Downing Street spokewoman said it was ""more than the equivalent"" of taking a session of Prime Minister's Questions every day the House was sitting. In the past two weeks along, Mrs May has spent more than nine-and-a-half hours at the Commons despatch box.    4.30pm update: Sturgeon rages TV debate without other political leaders would be 'TRAVESTY OF DEMOCRACY'The BBC has annoucned Theresa May has agreed to a live debate with Jeremy Corbyn on December 11. The Labour leader is yet to agree to the event taking place on the BBC, indicating a preference for ITV's debate proposal. Mrs May has previously rejected calls for other political parties to take part in the debate, but the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have all said they should be included. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ""If this or any TV debate goes ahead without all options - including that of remaining in the EU - being included and given a voice, it will be an absolute travesty of democracy.""4pm update: Pound falls to two-week low amid concerns around Parliament vote on BrexitThe pound fell to a two-week low on Thursday as concerns grow about Parliament's vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal and the Bank of England's warning of severe risks to the currency if Britain leaves the EU in a disorderly manner. Sterling was trading down 0.5 percent against the US dollar at $1.2760 and by the same margin against the euro at 89.14 pence.Fears around a no-deal Brexit had sent the pound falling to a two-week low earlier this week before it regained some losses. Currency analysts have warned a recovery is unlikely before the parliamentary vote on December 11, which will be a key risk event.Lee Hardman, an FX strategist at MUFG in London, said: ""It looks on paper like parliament is going to vote against the deal, which will lead us into heightened uncertainty.”3.30pm update: Brexit is single 'biggest risk factor' to tourism in Northern Ireland Tourism in Northern Ireland is more vulnerable to Brexit that any other region because it relies so much on the British market for most of its income from the sector, it has been claimed.Tourism Ireland chief executive Niall Gibbons warned the UK leaving the EU was the single ""biggest risk factor"" for the tourism sector. Northern Ireland is expecting to welcome more than 2.2 million visitors by the end of this year - British visitors are expected to account for more than 60 percent of that figure. Mr Gibbons said: “It's an extremely important industry.""Northern Ireland is more vulnerable than other areas because of its high dependency on the number of British tourists.""We know from our research that if more people in Britain decide to stay at home it's more likely that Devon and Cornwall, the Lake District and Scotland would be the winners than Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and Channel Islands because it involves getting a plane or a boat.""""It is more vulnerable because it does rely on the GB market for about nearly 70 percent of all its business.""He warned a Brexit deal is needed to ensure economic certainty and stability within the industry.Mr Gibbons said: ""When people are feeling uncertain, and if their pocket is going to get hit, the first thing that gets hit is discretionary spending which often is tourism.""It's important that a deal gets done, because ultimately consumers require certainty in their lives, that's what keeps them travelling.""

The next few weeks are highly unlikely to inject any festive cheer, especially if Theresa May's Brexit deal doesn't win backing from MPs.""The denouement to more than two years of bewildering Brexit wheeler-dealing looks like it will be enacted precisely when many consumers would prefer to be thinking of a well-earned Christmas break, filled with family get-togethers, warmth and festivity.""Brexit appears to be turning this year's season of goodwill into the season of uncertainty.""3pm update: Eurozone bank sector prepared for hard Brexit - backs Bank of England's recession warningThe European Central Bank has revealed the eurozone banking sector is prepared for a hard Brexit, and said the Bank of England (BoE) was right to warn of a deep recession if Britain leaves the bloc without a deal. On Wednesday, the BoE warned the British economy could shrink by eight percent in a year in the event of a no-deal Brexit. European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos told a news conference: ""Yesterday we had these reports from the UK Treasury and the Bank of England that I think made the correct point.""The most important point made by yesterday's report is that in case of a disorderly Brexit, the UK economy would enter into a period of very, very big recession, GDP would drop in the area of eight percent.“We can't lose sight that the most relevant issue is that a disorderly Brexit would have a very big, major recessionary impact on the UK.”  Ford boss has warned a no-deal Brexit would be a ""catastrophe"" (Image: Getty)Paul Withers taking over live reporting from Joe Duggan.2.43pm update: Jo Johnson believes Theresa May’s Brexit deal risks ripping the union apartJo Johnson believes Theresa May’s Brexit deal risks ripping the union apart.The Ex-Transport minister, who resigned over Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement, fears the agreement could spell “political armageddon” for the Conservative Party.Mrs May’s deal would “roll out the red carpet for Jeremy Corbyn”.Mr Johnson said: “The “worst of all worlds Tory Brexit” label will become an albatross around our necks for years to come.""In fact, as colleagues in Parliament have been warning in recent days, this deal pleases so few people that it could lead to electoral defeat on the scale of 1997 or worse, rolling out the red carpet to Corbyn. That is the double whammy.""Our country will have suffered a right hook from a PM’s botched Brexit and then a left hook from the arrival of Communist ideologues.""He added: ""The PM’s deal will also of course weaken our union.""1.58pm update: Remainer Greening urges second referendum ‘within 22 weeks’ of December voteTory former education secretary Justine Greening is adamant a new Brexit referendum could be organised and held in 22 weeks.Ms Greening, who backs a second EU vote, told an event in London: ""I've worked out that you could plan and hold a referendum in 22 weeks.""We could do that in 22 weeks. We could actually, after this vote on December 11, hold a referendum, potentially, on May 30 next year.""We could, alongside that, choose to extend Article 50, I've suggested, by four months to July 29.""

It's important that we get the agreement ratified that's on the table at the moment.“I keep pushing the point that we need frictionless trade at the borders as well.""That's not quite crystal clear in the withdrawal agreement.""1.30pm update: Brexiteers get last-ditch chance to change May's deal  MPs will debate Mrs May’s deal during five all-day sessions in Parliament ahead of the December 11 vote.During the five eight-hour debates, they will be able to table six amendments to the government’s motion before it goes to the Commons vote next month.The mammoth debating sessions will see Mrs May try to convince Conservative rebels to back her deal.A Labour amendment to the government motion aims to halt a “botched Brexit”.

Let us now be confident in the enormous opportunity which presents itself.It has been calculated that a WTO Brexit would produce a GDP boost of seven per cent to the UK economy over the next 15 years which would be worth about £140 billion.“Furthermore countries outside of the Single Market have increased their exports faster than Britain has to the EU over the last 30 years.

There are practical issues.""I think that support for an extension is an over-simplification because there are many in the European Parliament and elsewhere that are concerned about an extension in terms of the impact.""He added: ""There are many in Brussels that are concerned about the prospect of an extension in terms of the interplay with the European parliamentary elections, because you couldn't pass the legislation in the UK for a referendum in the time before the end of May.""""But also from the EU point of view, they have been very clear that they don't want an extension with no purpose and so we come back to the issue as to what it is MPs are for and just what they are against.""

GETTYApple CEO Tim Cook shows off his Apple Watch Sport to customers within the Apple StoreThe news comes days after a technology research firm revealed Apple Watch owners were more satisfied with the device than those who bought a first-generation iPhone and iPad.Speaking during the Q&A session at the end of the third quarter results, CEO Tim Cook told analysts: ""Sales of the Watch did exceed our expectations and they did so despite supply still trailing demand at the end of the quarter.""To give you a little additional insight, through the end of the quarter, in fact, the Apple Watch sell-through was higher than the comparable launch periods of the original iPhone or the original iPad.""Now, our objective of the quarter wasn’t primarily sales but also how we position the product in the long term because we are starting a new product category. ""And as I back up and look at this, with 8,500 apps, we’ve already announced the next watchOS 2 — It will bring native apps, which will be killer. ""Even though the store layout was delayed, we’ve learned a lot about the buying experience. ""We plan to expand channel before the holiday because we’re convinced that the watch will be one of the top gifts of the holiday.""I know I never go anywhere without the Watch. And it’s not because I’m the CEO of Apple, I’m that attached to it. ""I get a lot of notes from a lot of people that feel the same way. And so that’s how I look at the Watch.""  APPLEhose who want to replace their credit card with an Apple device need an iPhone 6, 6 Plus or Watch Apple is not planning to break out individual Apple Watch figures any time soon, however Tim Cook's comments seem to hint that earlier reports of Apple Watch orders dropping 90 per cent were inaccurate. Instead the firm's first wearable is being included in the Other category in its report.This category also includes sales of the Apple TV, iPod, Beats Electronics, Apple accessories and cases and Apple Watch.During its latest quarter, the Cupertino company reported an increase of revenue to $2.6 billion – up some 56 per cent sequentially.However this growth cannot be solely attributed to the Apple Watch, since other products within the category could have grown or dropped within the same three-month period.CEO Tim Cook himself hinted that the Apple Watch generated more revenue than the 56 per cent – or $1billion – increase.""If you look at Other products category, and look at the revenue in here, it would not be an accurate thing to just look at the sequential change, or the year over year change and assume that was just Watch revenue,"" he told analysts yesterday.""Because the aggregate balance of that category, both sequentially and year-over-year, is shrinking. ""Obviously the iPod is part of that but there are other things in there, accessories and so forth, that are shrinking.""Read MoreBritons' DIRTIEST secrets EXPOSED: Hackers threaten to LEAK Ashley Madison cheaters onlineHacking organisation The Impact Team has threatened to expose private data from cheating spouses website AshleyMadison.com including the names, credit card information, nude photographs and adulterous sexual fantasies of its 37 MILLION users.AshleyMadison – an online dating service for people seeking extramarital affairs – boasts more than 1.2 million British users.The salacious social network, which sells itself with the tagline “Life Is Short.

GETTYThe contactless payment card limit is set to increase from £20 to £30All ten credit and debit cards tested revealed some data using the hack.But while none gave up the three-digit CVV security code on the back of the card, one online store allowed the team to order a £3,000 TV with the incomplete data gathered. Contactless cards are supposed to mask personal data during a purchase – however, the technology clearly has flaws, a Which? spokesperson added.The news comes weeks after Apple launched its contactless payment solution Apple Pay across the UK.Apple Pay allows iPhone and Apple Watch owners to use their Apple-branded gadgets to pay at checkout instead of using a contactless payment card.The iPhone manufacturer has claimed its Apple Pay solution is more secure than contactless cards, since all transactions made in-store with the iPhone are secured by a fingerprint.Apple Pay will never reveal your card number or details to the merchant when you pay – making it more privacy-focused than current payment systems, Apple has claimed.  APPLEApple believes its the fingerprint sensor in its Apple Pay system is MORE secure than contactless Instead of the details on your credit or debit card, which are revealed when using contactless or chip-and-pin, Apple creates an entirely new “Unique Device Account Number”.In theory, the ""transaction-specific dynamic security code"" should prevent card details being cloned.Contactless payment continues to grow rapidly in popularity, with more than 2 billion spent through the system last year, according to the UK Cards Association.Speaking about the Which? experiment, a spokesperson said: ""Contactless cards are coded to 'mask' personal data, but using an easily obtainable reader and free software to decode data, we were able to read the card number and expiry date from all 10 cards.""We were also able to read limited details of the last 10 transactions, although no cards revealed the CVV security code (the number on the back).""We doubted we'd be able to make purchases without the cardholder's name or CVV code - but we were wrong.""We ordered two items - one a £3,000 TV - from a mainstream online shop using 'stolen' card details, combined with a false name and address.""Read More Apple iPhone 6S to drop 16GB storage optionThe iPhone 6S could be the first Apple smartphone to drop the 16GB internal storage configuration, according to a leak from the Cupertino firm's supply chain.Apple is reportedly dropping the 16GB internal storage configuration for its next iPhone model.The next-generation smartphone – which is expected to be named either iPhone 6S or iPhone 7 – will replace the current 16GB base model with 32GB of internal storage.  FUTURE SUPPLIER • IGThe ""smoother"" and ""stronger"" iPhone 6 Plus case leaked by Future Supplier Apple has been working hard to ensure those with limited internal storage will be able to update to the latest version of its mobile operating system, iOS.Sources within Apple’s Taiwan-based manufacturing partner Foxconn claim the packaging being prepared for the new iPhone does not include boxes for a 16GB model.iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus will reportedly only ship in 32GB, 64GB and 128GB configurations.""We can’t tell you [what Foxconn] department we received information [from], but we can [say] that the packaging of the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus [do not] have [stickers] with ’16GB capacity,"" wrote Chan Zhuang of Made In China Gadget.Apple has reportedly dropped Samsung as a supplier for its internal storage after the Korean firm increased its prices.This price hike is rumoured to be why Apple did not drop the 16GB configuration before the launch of the iPhone 6, back in September 2014.  APPLEApple debuted its pressure sensitive ForceTouch display technology in the Apple Watch However Apple Senior Vice President of Marketing Phil Schiller defended the Cupertino firm's decision to launch a 16GB base model, stating that iCloud makes up for the lack of on-board storage.""The belief is more and more as we use iCloud services for documents and our photos and videos and music, that perhaps the most price-conscious customers are able to live in an environment where they don’t need lots of local storage because these services are lightening the load,"" Mr Schiller said in an interview with John Gruber, of Daring Fireball.Apple is also rumoured to be using a stronger case for the iPhone 6S in an effort to avoid the same bendgate controversy that hit the iPhone 6 Plus last year.The successor to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will hit UK stores on September 24th – a date confirmed by a recent Vodafone leak.Apple is expected to include the Force Touch technology it debuted in the Apple Watch earlier this year.Force Touch would allow the iPhone to distinguish between a light tap and a harder press on the display.The subtle feature is used on the Apple Watch to hide menu items.Industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, of KGI Securities, believes Force Touch will be the single biggest selling point for the new Apple smartphone, which is also rumoured to sport an updated camera and 2GB of RAM.“Force Touch can enrich user experience due to more input methods and support of handwritten signatures, which is beneficial for expanding the commercial market,” Mr Kuo has claimed.

Maybe it is a bit daring to say so. But it seems obvious that something strong needs to be behind the idea to tinker with Article 50.Luxembourg's Prime Minister Prime Minister Xavier Bettel added: ""The ball is in London. They have to tell us what they want.“We are currently in a situation where we still don't know which direction things are moving in, if there will be an agreement or not.

I tried very, very hard to get the right vision of leaving the EU.""He added: ""The route the Government chose, the route the Prime Minister chose, which was to say let's stay in the customs union, let's stay locked in to the single market, let's have a situation in which the UK is basically governed by the EU even though we're outside the EU – that approach has been rejected by Parliament.""3.48pm ""Tremendous uncertainty""Borrowing one of Mr Trump's favourite words, Mr Winfree said: ""There is a tremendous amount of political uncertainty out there.""Such lack of clarity, he added, was a large reason for the reluctance of businesses to invest.He said: ""They are just sitting on their money.""Whenever that is settled and the political stuff gets worked out we will ultimately see investment go up.""3.45pm ""Businesses will bounce back after Brexit uncertainty is resolved,"" says ex-Trump advisorBusiness investment in the UK is poised to bounce back once uncertainty over Brexit has been resolved a former senior economic advisor to US President Donald Trump has said.Paul Winfree, an economist at the Heritage Foundation and former director of budget policy for the Trump administration, said the financial reserves are ""a lot higher"" than they have been historically.He said: ""So it would seem to me that when the political winds stop moving from here to there and there is some certainty in what is going on in the UK, some of that will be freed up and you will see investment start again and the pound come up.""The banks are sitting on assets and that is in part a derivative of Brexit.""3.42pm update: Corbyn's refusal ""deeply disappointing""Mr Williamson said of Mr Corbyn's refusal: ""This is deeply disappointing.""The Prime Minister reached out across the House of Commons, giving the Labour leader the option to talk and discuss how best to take things forward, and he's just turned round and refused to do this, despite the fact that so often he's talked to so many other organisations and groups.""The 42-year-old, who last year said Russia should ""go away and shut up"" in the wake of the Novichok attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and daughter Yulia in Salisbury – added: ""I very much hope that he will rethink his position and take a more mature and considered attitude.""It's always been clear that Britain can survive and it will thrive and it will prosper whether there is a deal or whether there is no deal, and it is absolutely right to ensure that no-deal is on the table.""We have a fantastic opportunity, an amazing deal that the Prime Minister has negotiated with the European Union, and that's the deal that Labour and all parties should be getting behind and backing.""

That is mad – that won't work.""However a month earlier, he had acknowledged, in an interview with LBC radio that ""the chances of the Turks readily acceding to the European Union are between nil and 20 percent – probably lower than that"".Vote Leave produced adverts posted widely on social media during the campaign which stated that ""Turkey (population 76 million) is joining the EU"" and ""Britain's new border is with Syria and Iraq"".

Since I made no remarks, I can't disown them.""However, Mr Johnson was a signatory to an open letter to then-prime minister David Cameron a week before the referendum vote in June 2016 stating that it was EU policy that Turkey should join, and demanding to know if Britain will veto its accession and block plans for visa-free travel for its citizens.""If the Government cannot give this guarantee, the public will draw the reasonable conclusion that the only way to avoid having common borders with Turkey is to Vote Leave and take back control on 23 June,"" said the letter, signed by Mr Johnson and fellow-Brexiters Michael Gove and Gisela Stuart.2.40pm update: Youth group sends People’s Vote message to CorbynJeremy Corbyn has been targeted in his own back yard by a campaign urging him to back a second referendum and avoid ""colluding"" with Theresa May.Youth group Our Future Our Choice (OFOC), led by Labour and Momentum member Cathleen Clarke, have paid for a wraparound advert on one of Mr Corbyn's local papers in north London.The cover of Friday's Islington Tribune features the faces of 130 young supporters, activists and members of the Labour Party calling for a public vote on Brexit.In an open letter to Mr Corbyn on the inside of the cover, they warn the Labour leader he cannot get the general election he wants.This, it says, leaves a choice: ""Either collude with the Tories to pass a second-rate deal that saves Theresa May's premiership, or we can support a public vote on Brexit.""2.09pm update: Rees-Mogg to host weekly radio showTory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has been given his own weekly radio show in the run-up to Brexit.Mr Rees-Mogg will host an hour-long programme on LBC, the first at 6pm today, with the radio station saying it would be ""packed with callers, opinion and debate"".Mr Rees-Mogg said: ""With Brexit at the top of the agenda and opinions running high, I look forward to finding out what the public really thinks over the next couple of months and to continuing the national debate on LBC.""The chairman of the European Research Group (ERG) of Eurosceptic Conservatives has previously been a regular guest at LBC, taking part in a fortnightly half-hour phone-in during Nick Ferrari's breakfast show.London Mayor Sadiq Khan and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson have regular phone-in slots on the radio station, while former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has an evening slot from Monday to Thursday.LBC's managing editor James Rea said: ""With the country in a state of political confusion, Jacob Rees-Mogg joins the LBC line-up during an extraordinary period.""

We have been consistent that for us it is the backstop which needs to be dealt with.“For the future we want an agreement which returns control of our money, our laws and our borders through a UK wide free trade arrangement with the EU.“The story in the Times is an attempt to cause division.

The First Minister said she will pursue the referendum “regardless” of what happens with the Brexit process.It comes as British Prime Minister Theresa May battles to set out a “Plan B” for her Withdrawal Agreement, to present to the Commons on January 29.Ms Sturgeon made the case to MSPs at Holyrood on Thursday, saying: “I think the Prime Minister is very well aware of my views on independence, I support independence and I think the sooner Scotland is independent the better for all of us.”9.44am update: Majority thinks Corbyn wrong to snub May invitationThe majority of the public think Jeremy Corbyn is wrong to snub Theresa May’s offer of Brexit talks unless she rules out leaving the EU without a deal, according to a Sky Data poll.The poll found 51 percent said the Labour leader was wrong not to negotiate with the Prime Minister with 25 percent saying he is right and 25 percent unsure.Mr Corbyn has urged Labour MPs not to engage with the Government until the threat of no deal is removed, with Mrs May responding that the demand is an ""impossible condition"".The Sky Data poll found although Labour voters back Mr Corbyn, they are divided on the issue - with 45 percent saying he is right, 35 percent wrong, and 20 percent don't know.   9.30am update: Sterling soars to two-month high agains the euroThe pound reached a two-month high against the euro today as Sterling continues to remain firm in the face of ongoing Brexit uncertainty.Sterling smashed through the €1.140-barrier during the early hours of trade before slipping down again briefly, but still holding well above €1.130.The last time the pound soared through €1.140 was back in November 2018.The pound is trading at €1.1377 against the euro early doors and was at $1.2966 against the dollar after earlier getting tantalisingly close to breaching $1.30.

There could be another referendum.""""The Remain side is well-funded, well-organised. They are getting ready for another referendum.

The figure is up from 45 in October.Pharmacists said they were struggling to obtain some common medicines and are paying higher prices as a result.While some experts said uncertainty over Brexit was making the situation worse, others said this was not the case.Other reasons for the shortage may include increased global demand, cost of raw materials, new regulatory requirements driving up costs and fluctuations in exchange rates.Another explanation is that the NHS has driven down the prices it will pay for drugs, which makes the UK less attractive to manufacturers.Gareth Jones, from the National Pharmacy Association, told the BBC: ""Uncertainty over Brexit appears to be a significant factor.""Martin Sawer, executive director of the Healthcare Distribution Association, said people might be stockpiling medicines.He said: ”Some businesses could be speculating on Brexit.

Of course, when you are as well-travelled as the Queen, things are bound to go wrong, despite the months of planning that go into state visits.She may have overtaken Queen Victoria as the longest-serving monarch in British history last September – but her reign has been truly record-breaking when it comes to the countries she has visited: a staggering 128 and counting. Quite a feat for someone who has never owned a passport.From the Cocos Island (with a population of 596) to the vast People’s Republic of China, the Queen is certainly the most well-travelled monarch in history, full stop. She has visited Canada over 22 times – more than the total of all her great-great grandmother Victoria’s official foreign excursions combined. Although travel is obviously much easier now.Transatlantic trips have often been somewhat gaffe-prone. It was during a state visit to the US in 1991 when the American nation found itself being addressed by the Queen’s hat.No one thought to adjust the microphone after George Bush Senior finished speaking – all 6ft 2in of him. It later emerged that the 5ft 4in Queen was supposed to stand on a red carpeted box that was hidden inside the lectern, but the Chief of Protocol was too busy chatting to the First Lady to instruct someone to get it out.   S MAGThe Princess on a Royal tour of South Africa in 1947The Washington Post had a field day with the President the next morning but the Queen took it all in her diminutive stride. Addressing a joint meeting of Congress the following day, she puckishly asked members if they could see her now.When President Gerald Ford asked the Queen to dance at a White House dinner in 1976, she kept her cool and smiled serenely when the United States Marine Band launched into a loud rendition of The Lady Is A Tramp.Thirty one years later, George W Bush attempted to reference that visit when welcoming the Queen once again to the White House in 2007.“Her Majesty helped our nation celebrate its bicentennial in seventeen-seven…,” he proudly announced, before trailing off, realising he’d just made the monarch a good 200 years old. “In 1976,” he finished, with a sheepish pause. The Queen just smiled. When she heard that former American President and peanut farmer Jimmy Carter had once affronted the Queen Mother by kissing her full on the lips, she reportedly laughed out loud.  Queen Elizabeth II: 90 of her most candid snaps Sun, June 12, 2016To help celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's 90th birthday we have collated 90 of her most candid pictures.

(Perhaps it’s a girl thing. When Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating put his arm around the Queen during her 1992 tour of Australia he was dubbed “the Lizard of Oz”. Eight years later, his successor John Howard was accused of the same after being photographed with what appeared to be his arm around her, although he strenuously denied contact was made.)Acutely aware of the importance of Anglo-American relations, it’s no wonder the Queen glossed over “Toastgate”, telling President Obama and VIP guests including Kevin Spacey and Tom Hanks: “Our relationship goes far beyond our military and diplomatic ties. We are here to celebrate the tried, tested and – yes – special relationship between our two countries.”Suffice to say, the state banquet proved a success – as did the Obamas’ three-day visit. The President even gave the Queen a leather-bound album of her father George VI’s 1939 visit to the US with the Queen Mother (when they first met in 2009, he gave her an iPod loaded with Broadway hits and video footage of her state visit to the US in 2007).For former ambassador Charles Crawford, the Queen’s handling of the faux pas was emblematic of her entire reign. He said: “A brilliant example of Her Majesty’s diplomacy was that state banquet at Buckingham Palace in 2011. “The American President suffered an awkward moment when he broke royal protocol by speaking over the UK national anthem.“If you watch closely at what’s happening, you can see the Queen looking down at the notes in front of them, trying to work out what’s gone wrong. She calmly respects the anthem, then smiles sweetly to President Obama afterwards. “As far as I know, she has never made any protocol slip at all, in 64 years on the throne, which is technically astonishing. Not one. She is practically perfect in that respect – if anything’s innate then it’s this sense of how to perform the role.That sense of just the right way to behave is consistently maintained. It gives people a reassurance, and that’s important. Of course, mistakes happen – but they are not the Queen’s mistakes.”  S MAGThe Queen smiles as she and the Duchess of Cambridge enjoy a children’s sports event in 2012The former British diplomat, who worked for the Foreign Office for 28 years, helped to oversee the Queen’s state visit to Moscow in 1994, the first time a British monarch had visited Russia since the Revolution. He recalled a British blunder when the Queen visited Warsaw two years later.An error with the invitations led to several Polish VIPs arriving at the state banquet only to find they were not on the final guest list. “There they were, ready for perhaps the greatest night of their lives, and because we made a ghastly mistake they had to return home,” he said.The Queen made up for it by inviting the snubbed diners to a private audience the next day.“She made sure they had quality time with her the following morning. This attentiveness when things go wrong is so impressive.” As Andrew Marr pointed out in his 2012 book The Diamond Queen: “She has never seen herself as just, or perhaps even, mainly, the British Queen.”The woman who Nelson Mandela used to call “my dear friend Elizabeth” inherited a disintegrating Empire when she acceded the throne on February 6, 1952.Only five years earlier, on her 21st birthday, she had famously pledged to dedicate her life to the service of the Commonwealth.During a tour of South Africa, she gave a radio broadcast in Cape Town that has gone on to become one of her most seminal speeches. She said: “I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.” True to her word, a few months after her Coronation in 1953, she left for a six-month tour of the Commonwealth, visiting 13 countries in the West Indies, Australasia, Asia and Africa, covering 43,618 miles by land, air and sea.Thousands flocked to the banks of the River Thames to see her arriving home on the Royal Yacht Britannia. She had circumnavigated the globe, opened seven parliaments, made 157 speeches and four broadcasts – and she was only 28 years old.    In the intervening years, a great many of the nations of which the Queen was once head of state have become republics. Of the 53 members of the Commonwealth, only 16 retain the sovereign. Throughout troubled and often turbulent times, she has strived to remain neutral in a bid to transcend party politics – occasionally against the advice of her own Government. She insisted on travelling to Ghana in 1961, four years after she was removed as the country’s head of state and despite recent bombings in Accra, prompting Prime Minister Harold Macmillan to note: “She means to be a Queen and not a puppet.”Then she shunned risks for her own safety again by attending the 1979 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Lusaka, Zambia.She was said to be furious when Margaret Thatcher tried to stop her. The Prime Minister feared the monarch might become embroiled in a Commonwealth row, which had plagued the organisation since Ian Smith’s Unilateral Declaration of Independence of 1965. There were even concerns surface-to-air missiles might be used to attack the Queen’s plane. Once inside the Zambian capital she used her royal clout to persuade then President Kenneth Kaunda and his main political adviser Mark Chona to drop parts of a planned speech that would have offended people who didn’t want to hear men like Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo being described as “freedom fighters”. Her private secretary Philip Moore later wrote: “The Queen intervened personally with the President.This the Queen did in the motor car and later that evening, Mark Chona came to see me to say that the President had agreed to make all the amendments for which we’d asked.”The Lusaka summit paved the way for a final settlement to the problem of Rhodesia, a ceasefire by the (short-lived) Patriotic Front and elections involving all parties in February 1980, which were won by Robert Mugabe’s Zanu PF. (The Queen would later strip the evil dictator of the honorary knighthood he was awarded in 1994 after the Foreign Office cited his “consistent campaign of human rights violations and disregard for the democratic process.”)Then Foreign Secretary Dr David Owen later wrote about how steady the Queen had remained during the difficult talks about Rhodesia: “It would have been awfully easy for the Queen to come down on the side of those right-wing critics of Rhodesia, who were calling me a terrorist for getting involved with Nkomo and Mugabe.” No wonder Prince Philip once described her as “the Commonwealth’s physiotherapist”.   S MAGThe Queen, Prince Charles and Camilla, enjoy a laugh during the Braemar Gathering in September, 2006In his book The English Constitution, 19th- century journalist Sir Walter Bagehot wrote a monarch’s role was: “The right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.”As Ann Morrow put it in her 1983 book, The Queen, Her Majesty understood that it was “important that her role was seen not as that of an old-fashioned Queen Empress, but more as a high-powered influential friend who understood their affection for the Club, even if it had become temporarily unfashionable”. Her role as healer, comforter, consoler and counsellor at every CHOGM since Ottawa in 1973 has been integral to her reign. One Australian paid tribute to her skill during a past summit when he described her as “a grandmother cooling the family squabbles”. The Queen knows most of the leaders more than they know each other, meaning that she can act as independent arbiter of their affairs.But that’s not to say her Commonwealth subjects have always warmed to her.She was pelted with eggs in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1986 – prompting her to joke afterwards, “I myself prefer my New Zealand eggs for breakfast.”And there was an apparent assassination attempt near Sydney in 1970 when suspected republicans allegedly tried to derail the royal train by placing a large log on the tracks. But the driver was going so slowly that it did no damage and the Queen and Prince Philip remained blissfully unaware of the incident.It was during that trip Down Under that the Queen undertook her first royal “walkabout” – a feature of every foreign tour since.Being of the opinion that monarchy “should be seen to be believed”, the Queen wears bright colours precisely so people can pick her out of a large crowd.

She has a phenomenal memory and is impeccably well briefed. “She’s also very good at asking open questions to get people chatting, which is the mark of a skilled diplomat. Of course, her experience on the international stage is unparalleled, and that counts for a great deal. “She’s been doing this role for a very long time, seen leaders come and go, even countries come and go. But what’s really unusual about the Queen is that she is above politics. She is unlike any other leader in that she recognises it isn’t all about her but her relationship and interaction with her people.”Charles Crawford added: “In foreign countries there is often endless elaborate protocol around leaders. The Queen, however, doesn’t want that. She wants to get down to business. There is a steely practicality about her. She sets a unique tone of informal formality – light touch. It’s all very subtle.“For instance, politicians often have massive motorcades stopping traffic. They don’t care who they inconvenience. But not the Queen – she doesn’t want to intrude into people’s lives. She insists on the least disruption possible. It’s very unusual – a leader who actually respects the public. It’s supremely effective and impressive, and it shows why her visits advance British diplomatic interests.“I remember walking around Westminster one day and suddenly I looked up to see the Queen’s car waiting near the Houses of Parliament. There she was, just sitting there in the back, waiting without a fuss. Obviously the car had arrived early to an engagement. She wanted to walk through the door at the exact second she was supposed to. There was no obvious heavy security. No flimflam, all very understated – it’s incredibly professional.”   S MAGThe Queen and Prince Philip  wave on her Golden Jubilee in June 2002 While the Queen’s globetrotting has played an enormous part in strengthening friendships and economic ties between the UK and other countries – there have also been hugely significant historical visits. The Queen made the first state visit by a reigning monarch to China in 1986, visiting the Great Wall, Russia in October 1994, Brunei in 1998 and South Korea in 1999.In March 1995, she spent six days in South Africa after the end of apartheid.Even though Buckingham Palace announced that she would not be travelling long-haul after her 2011 visit to Australia, the Queen continues to make an impact wherever she goes and some of her most important overseas trips have only happened in recent years and on our doorstep. Her 2014 visit to the Vatican City to meet Pope Francis, then 77, was a particular highlight, having previously met Pius XII in 1951, John XXIII in 1961, John Paul II in 1980, 1982 and 2000, and Benedict XVI during his visit to the UK in 2010. On giving the current Pontiff a set of framed, signed photographs of herself and Prince Philip, the Queen joked: “I’m afraid you have to have a signed photograph, it’s inevitable.”During a tour of Germany last June, she visited the site of the Second World War concentration camp, Bergen-Belsen, before laying a wreath in memory of the thousands of Jews who died there, including teenage diarist Anne Frank. It was the first time the Queen had visited a concentration camp and aides said she had specifically requested the trip with Prince Philip. There was no pomp and ceremony, just a couple from the wartime generation taking their time to pay their respects.After survivors and liberators told them about their shared experience of horror, the Queen said to one person: “It’s difficult to imagine, isn’t it? It must have been horrific.” In her state banquet speech in Berlin she reflected on her first visit to Germany since 1965, saying, “In the 50 years since our first visit, our countries have lived through many profound changes.”   But it was Her Majesty’s state visit to Ireland five years ago that will be forever hailed as one of the most significant events in her six-decade reign.Dubbed an “extraordinary moment in history”, the four-day tour was the first time a British king or queen had visited the Emerald Isle since 1911.Emblematic of the progress that has been made between the two countries, the Queen’s speech at Dublin Castle made her an unlikely star.After laying a wreath at the Croke Park stadium where 14 people were killed by British forces 91 years earlier, she said, “To all those who have suffered as a consequence of our troubled pastI extend my sincere thoughts and deep sympathy.“With the benefit of historical hindsight we can all see things which we would wish had been done differently or not at all.”Of all the handshakes over the years, arguably the most symbolic was when she took Martin McGuinness’s hand in hers during a visit to Northern Ireland the following year. The conciliatory gesture towards the Deputy First Minister spoke volumes not only of how far the Peace Process had come, but also the vital part Her Majesty had played in it.Here was the Head of the Monarchy, long vilified by Nationalists, offering the hand of friendship to a former commander of the IRA that in 1979 had blown up Lord Mountbatten, Prince Philip’s uncle and Prince Charles’s beloved “mentor”.McGuinness later paid tribute to the Queen for being “miles ahead” of political leaders in Ireland and Britain in terms of achieving real progress in the Peace Process. “I think she sets an example that others should follow,” he said.Peter Hain, who was Secretary of State for Northern Ireland from 2005 to 2007 during the signing of the St Andrews Agreement, which built on the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in devolving power to Northern Ireland, believes the Queen helped to create a “metamorphosis” in the once divided country.“Previously the Royal Family was seen as the embodiment of an alien British state by the Nationalist community,” said the former Labour MP. “Now she is welcomed. The handshake was a very important symbol of the healing within Northern Ireland.” Related articles   Queen relaxes after hectic visit of Chinese premier with serene ride around Windsor Castle  Windsor Castle – a look inside the Queen's home  Prince Harry views the Queen as his boss  Elizabeth at 90: Happy Birthday, Your MajestyLaurence Robertson, chairman of the Northern Ireland select committee, accompanied the Queen on some engagements during her 2011 visit to the Republic.“People were a bit surprised by how well it went. I think that’s largely because of the Queen’s experience and that of her advisers but also Ireland put a great deal into it,” said the Conservative MP.“When she first got there she was wearing an emerald green outfit and spoke a few words in Irish. She went to the Garden of Remembranceand Croke Park, scene of the 1920 Bloody Sunday massacre, and was prepared to remember the past, saying, ‘We can’t forget what has happened,’ and I think people were very pleased she was strong enough to do that and that paved the way towards a better future together. “The division along religious grounds has only ever been exploited by a few people. The Queen has always been above all that. She has always represented the sensible approach.”Not only the sensible approach – but the subtle one. Charles Crawford has written speeches for members of the Royal Family and said the Queen’s words are “always controlled, yet say a lot”.He added: “The Royal Family in its gracious understated way can convey subtle messages. They express a great deal between the lines. “The people close to the Queen are very good at framing the message she has to convey. Take Ireland – that speech was not something an elected head of state would have delivered. The subtle substance, tone and warmth of the Queen’s words always speak for themselves.”  S MAGWelcoming former South African president Nelson Mandela to Buckingham Palace in 2003Having never granted any interviews, we have often had to glean the Queen’s thoughts from her speeches and Christmas broadcasts (something she pioneered back in 1952, the first of which was televised five years later).She famously described 1992 as her “annus horribilis” after three of her four children separated and Windsor Castle was partially destroyed by fire.In 1997, she gave an unprecedented televised address to the nation amid an unprecedented outpouring of grief for Princess Diana, when the Royal Family was criticised for its “cold” reaction to her death in a Paris car crash.By speaking to her subjects “from the heart”, as “Queen and as a grandmother”, she managed to win back the support of a public who realised that she wasn’t lacking in feeling, just bound by tradition.Later that year, the monarch paid tribute to her husband as they marked their Golden Wedding anniversary, describing Prince Philip as “my strength and stay all these years”. For every step of her journey as Queen, the 94-year-old Duke has been by her side (or more accurately, several paces behind). When she became queen at 25 with two small children, she is reported to have commented, “In a way I didn’t have an apprenticeship. My father died much too young and so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can.” It was simply a case of getting on with it.  S MAGWith Pope Francis at The Vatican in 2014Both a stickler for tradition and a forward-thinking moderniser, arguably the secret to the Queen’s success has been her willingness to embrace change. As she said in an address to both Houses of Parliament back on her Golden Jubilee in 2002, “For if a Jubilee becomes a moment to define an age, then for me we must speak of change. “Change has become a constant, managing it has become an expanding discipline. The way we embrace it defines our future.”Prime Minister David Cameron once described her as leading “a gentle evolution of our monarchy, bringing it close to the people while maintaining its dignity”. When she became Britain’s longest- serving monarch last September, the Queen admitted, “It is not a record to which I have ever aspired.”She was about to open a new railway in Scotland when she paid fleeting reference to the historic milestone in her short speech.“Inevitably, a long life can pass by many milestones. My own is no exception,” she said with typical understatement. “But I thank you all and the many others at home and overseas for your touching messages of great kindness.”With characteristic pragmatism, she added, “So now to the business in hand…”Even at 90, there is no question that the Queen will continue to put duty first, as she vowed to her Commonwealth subjects on her 21st birthday.It was one thing for a young Princess to utter those inspiring words – but quite another to have lived by them for more than 60 years. "

And we will then make a judgement.""One option is still the intensively negotiated documents, plus the addition in Strasbourg, which I believe is very good and important, that this will get a majority in the British Parliament, but we also have to be prepared that this might not happen and therefore we will decide every day even after this summit about what we can still do and this doesn’t just depend on us but also on Great Britain. ""But I would also like to emphasise, the agreement was well negotiated and therefore our scope is limited but we are full of good intensions to find a solution and we believe and hope, which would also be good for Britain and the entire Irish questions.""Because if there is an unregulated Brexit then there will be a border of the single market between Northern Ireland and Ireland and these are things we want to avoid.""   1.34pm update: Pedro Sanchez asks UK whether it wants to take part in EU elections or not Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez said the UK must clarify whether they want to take part in the EU elections, as it would open different Brexit scenarios. He also said the extension to Article 50 is not the only issue to debate at this summit. Speaking to reporters, the Spanish prime minister said: ""This is a very important European council for the future of Europe and the future of Spain.""We will talk about Brexit and we will hear the opinion of May, which is essential to decide if we extend it or not.""But there are also other issues: industrial policy and competition policy.""We want competition policy to adapt to the new era.""Thirdly, there will be a debate on whether commercial negotiations with the United Kingdom will be initiated.""Finally, the relationship of the EU with China is another topic.""First of all, I think it's good to know for sure what the British government's request is.

And some conditions also will be discussed. ""We will do everything we can from our side but UK needs to take serious and final decision.

Other nations hit would be France at £6.90bn (€8bn) and Italy at £3.47bn (€4bn).The authors said an approved withdrawal agreement would significanty mitigate these figures.11.45am update: Jeremy Corbyn MOCKED by HIS OWN MP after walking out from Brexit crisis talks Labour MP Ian Murray tweeted an ironic attack on Jeremy Corbyn's walk-out from Brexit crisis talks, highlighting how Mr Corbyn is failing to champion a second referendum campaign like Chuka Umunna is, despite it being Labour Party policy.He said: ""As for Jeremy Corbyn. He was right to walk out of talks with the PM tonight because @ChukaUmunna was attending.""Chuka would have championed what is Labour Party policy in a public vote.""How dare Chuka champion the policy of Labour members.

We will however continue to talk to the prime minister because we think it is our duty to try and undo some of the damage included in the withdrawal agreement. ""But we have made it quite clear that unless there is a legal means by which Northern Ireland would not be treated differently from the United Kingdom, not just assurances or promises but acting legislation, we will not be supporting the withdrawal agreement.""10.50pm update: Barclays' chairman says the EU would be harmed 'very significantly' by a no deal Brexit John Thomas McFarlane OBE, Barclays’ chairman, said a no deal Brexit would hurt the EU “very significantly”.Speaking at a Brexit conference, he said: ""In the event of a no-deal Brexit, it would hurt the EU very significantly."" And in a bid to quash the worries of the financial sector in London, which has historically spoken out against leaving the bloc without an agreement securing the future relationship between Brussels and the UK, the Barclays’ boss added the EU is likely whatever form Brexit takes.     John Thomas McFarlane OBE issued a stark warning addressed to the EU (Image: GETTY)10.25am update: Former European Commission president believes the EU27 may agree on a long extensionFormer president of the European Commission Romano Prodi believes EU leaders could back a long extension to Article 50. The Italian politician and economist told Today: ""I still think that there will be more time, there will be some compromise in order to get more time because really the common will against a hard Brexit is real."" 10am update: Theresa May's deal could be backed next week, says junior Brexit ministerKwasi Kwarteng believes there is a good chance the withdrawal agreeement will be backed by a majority at the third meaningful vote next week. The junior Brexit minister told Sky News: ""We have a good shot at actually landing the deal next week. ""People are coming over already because people's minds are focusing on the deal and the ability to leave the EU in a timely and orderly way.""9.40am update: Britain's financial services have been 'thrown under a bus' City of London financial district chief Catherine McGuinness heavily criticised how the Government has handled Brexit. She claimed that financial services have been ""thrown under a bus"" in terms of Britain's efforts to secure a divorce settlement with the bloc. She said: ""It's imperative we avoid a no-deal Brexit. An extension would be welcome and let's hope our EU partners agree to that.""But it would only be a sticking plaster unless the deep underlying issues are resolved and we actually make progress.

We can fulfil this wish in principle if there will be a positive vote about the exit deal next week in the British Parliament.""However, regarding the concrete date we have to be mindful that we have the European elections in May, which means the future and the legality of the European elections need to be preserved.

When that is done, it's impeachment on Tuesday.”In his first public appearance since this week's coup, Mr Mugabe travelled to a graduation ceremony at a university in Harare today where he is the chancellor.Wearing a blue and yellow gown, he was met by cheers from the crowd in what looked like a show of defiance.Zimbabwe's influential war veterans leader Christopher Mutsvangwa, issued a “stark warning” today, warning Mugabe and his wife to step aside, saying: “It is done.”He said Mugabe would not be able to resist the military and stay in power.Botswana’s President Ian Khuma also added his voice to the calls for a change at the top, saying it was an opportunity for “peace and prosperity”. He said: ”I don't think anyone should be president for that amount of time. “We are presidents, we are not monarchs.

A managed election process would in all likelihood lead to the victory of former vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa, the army's favoured candidate.

People are just waiting to see what will happen next.""As a lawyer, some cases which were to be heart at Mag Court today have been postponed coz Magistrates were cautious of the situation.""But Zimbabwe police commissioner Augustine Chihuri has also been detained and arrested by army officials today.Tapfuma Mavhuranzira told Express.co.uk: “Army has had their leave cancelled, not police. They are sitting in a line because their leader Chihuri is on of those targeted by army.”Harare resident Denissa Moyannahas said she saw police being beaten by soldiers she travelled into the city centre, known as the central business district (CBD), from her home in the upmarket suburb of Borrowdale this morning.   However social media users say there is an “uneasy calm” on the streets of the capital today following the unrest.One Twitter user said: “Family friend had to drop someone at the airport in Harare. Said he was searched by the army on the way, but ""it was all very pleasant”.”Another tweeted: “In Harare i havent witnessed any violence this morning. There's an uneasy calm. Not many cars out here; most people have stayed indoors. Soldiers are conducting stop-and-searches on major roads.”A third added: “Soldiers closed off N.Mandela St & part of S. Machel. Tanks at Reserve Bank and High Court. But I walked past them. Not bothering anyone. No gunshots. No abuse of civilians. We're all busy at work.”While it remained calm on the streets, a source told the Guardian that people in Zimbabwe are “excited because they are ready for change”.The official added: “I don’t think will get violent because they are doing this for the people - if they start shedding blood can’t do that any more. That is why they told people to stay away from centre of town unless they have business, so trouble-makers cannot stir things up”Police made to sit down in a line by Army #Parliament #Zimbabwe pic.twitter.com/7Ju2QPofB8— Fred Matsheza (@Iam_FredrelZW) November 15, 2017  The developing national crisis began after military bosses stormed a state television station, where soldiers made a statement claiming they have intervened to target criminals around Mugabe.Zimbabwe’s military chief said the army wanted to deal with people who ""were committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country”.He added: ”As soon as we have accomplished our mission, we expect that the situation will return to normal.""Since the takeover, state broadcasters played patriotic struggle songs from the independence period of the 1980s throughout the day - broadcasting no other news other than to repeat Major-General Sibusiso Moyo’s statement.From just after midday local time (10:00 GMT) ZBC returned to its regular schedule, which included a drama programme, cartoons and the lunchtime news.READ MORE: Robert Mugabe dead? Is the Zimbabwe leader alive and safe?   AFPThe national police force has recalled all officers on leaveThe military broadcast also instructed all members of the defence forces to regroup as “all leave is cancelled”, adding: “We call upon all the war veterans to play a positive role in ensuring peace, stability and unity in the country.“To members of the Zimbabwe defence forces, all leave is cancelled and you are all to return to your barracks with immediate effect.“To the other security forces we urge you to cooperate for the good of our country.“Let it be clear we intend to address the human security threats in our country. Therefore any provocation will be met with an appropriate response.”Since the broadcast, military chiefs have acted fast to detain those closest to the Zimbabwean president.Finance minister Ignatius Chombo is among those detained by the army, according to Government sources.There was allegedly a brief gunfight outside Mr Chombo’s house, with images showing the front gates to his home having been smashed in and bullet holes in kitchen appliances.And sources say Chombo had $10,000,000 at his house when arrested which has been seized by military police.A number of other Zimbabwean cabinet ministers have been arrested‚ sources say, including higher education minister Jonathan Moyo and local government minister Saviour Kasukuwere.Zanu PF youth secretary Cde Kudzanai Chipanga, a loyal supporter of Mugabe, has also been detained a day after saying his youth win was ready to die for Mugabe.Last night, he issued an apology - saying he was just a young man, still learning and had learnt a lot from the incident.And on Thursday, Masvingo resident minister Paul Chimedza was also arrested.   REUTERSZimbabwe citizens have been seen queuing at banks  AFPZimbabwe's military used state television to vow to target ""criminals"" close to MugabeArmed forces have promised that they will protect the civil service against planned purges.However, soldiers and armoured vehicles continue to block roads to the main government offices, parliament and the courts in central Harare, witnesses have reported.Worried locals have started queuing for cash outside banks, which could have a knock-on economic effect if anxious investors pull out. This is not an unusual sight in Zimbabwe, however.The country replaced its own currency with US dollars in 2009 after a financial crash caused by hyperinflation.And in the last year, a shortage of hard cash has left people queuing for hours in order to withdraw their money.The crisis has also seen the Bitcoin price double to £10,000 on Zimbabwe’s Golix exchange on Wednesday after the political turmoil ensued.The price of the cryptocurrency in the Southern African nation jumped as high as $13,499, almost double the rate at which it trades in international markets.And demand for the online currency in Zimbabwe also surged amid a shortage of hard currency.

The authorities have sometimes used force to suppress demonstrations.”UK Prime Minister Theresa also urged Brits in Zimbabwe to remain indoors as the situation “remains fluid”. Speaking at in the House of Commons earlier, Mrs May said: “We are monitoring those developments very carefully, the situation is still fluid and we urge restraint on all sides.”And British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it was still unclear whether the seizure of power by the military in Harare marked the downfall of President Robert Mugabe.""We cannot tell how developments in Zimbabwe will play out in the days ahead and we do not know whether this marks the downfall of Mugabe or not,"" Johnson told the British parliament.He added Britain always wanted Zimbabwe's citizens to be masters of their fate, adding the UK would do all it could to ensure that elections next year were free and fair.Emily Thornberry, Labour's shadow foreign secretary, has urged the UK government to continue to provide ""every assistance necessary"" to all British citizens in Zimbabwe.
