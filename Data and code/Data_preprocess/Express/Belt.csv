The programme, aimed at stimulating global economic growth through the creation of an international corridor of land and naval trading routes, could cost a mind-boggling $1 trillion (£774.9 billion). The BRI is forecast to account for one third of the world’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the future, according to the EU-owned European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).

He said: ”It builds on three pillars - a significant amount of aid or very low-interest rate loans provided by China to the recipient country to build and develop its infrastructure. An assumption that the key contractors undertaking these infrastructure projects will be Chinese companies, in their vast majority state-owned enterprises. “Finally, a commitment of non-interference to the recipient country’s internal politics on behalf of the Chinese government.“The combination of these three factors make the scheme very attractive to any country, especially those with non-democratic regimes as it offers an alternative to World Bank’s development model that has usually attached democratisation conditions.”So why the concern? Dr Filippaios says that it is not PM May that is wary but the vast majority of developed countries’ political leaders.He said: “This initiative has the potential to significantly expand China’s economic and political influence in an area that is bordering with Europe.“China has already successfully penetrated a large number of African countries, rich in natural resources, and is not building stronger economic links with countries in Asia and Eastern Europe creating a trade route that will give Chinese companies access to a large number of markets.”"

The BRI, also known as Silk Road Economic Belt, is a development plan adopted by the Chinese government to tighten cooperation with foreign countries. The decision has upset both the US, currently entwined in difficult negotiations with Beijing to end their bitter trade war, and the EU, which is concerned about the amount of access state-backed companies in China are gaining into European technologies and infrastructure.  Related articles   Beijing BANS Canadian imports as diplomatic spat INTENSIFIES   EU to launch bid to please countries furious over anti-China stance But Italy, which has been increasingly stepping out of the line dictated by the EU more than once since its eurosceptic coalition sworn in on June 1 last year, hopes an endorsement to the BRI will make Rome a “more attractive and easier” market for investors in Beijing, according to analysts.Agatha Kratz, at consultancy company Rhodium Group, said: “Italian leaders hope that the memorandum will increase the visibility of Italy as an investment destination, making it more attractive and easier for Chinese investors to invest under the BRI banner.”Italy’s new relationship with China within the BRI’s frame is considered unusual by experts.   Italy is to become the first G7 country to endorse China's globalisation strategy (Image: GETTY)Until now, the BRI has seen Beijing collaborating with less developed nations than Italy, according to Jonathan Hillman, director of the Reconnecting Asia Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.He said: “Italy is an unusual candidate for China’s BRI, economically and politically.“As a member of the G7, it would be the largest economy to endorse the BRI. “It may be looking to position itself as an alternative to the EU’s larger economies, where scrutiny of Chinese investments has been increasing.”   Related articles   China warns of PROFOUND change as US trade war slows economic growth    EU has ‘overestimated Russia and UNDERESTIMATED China’s sway over EU   Xi Jinping and Donald Trump's negotiating teams are trying to put an end to their trade war (Image: GETTY)  Rome has been in open defiance with many of the EU's positions in the past year (Image: GETTY)Launched in 2013, the BRI has seen more than 2,200 deals announced, but not all of them have gone ahead.Rome’s decision to try to attract Chinese assets comes after the Chinese foreign direct investment in Europe fell by 40 percent in 2018 and more than 50 percent in 2017, marking the lowest level in four years, as shown in a survey by Germany’s Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) and the New York research firm Rhodium Group (RHG).The plunge has been caused both by tightened investment rules for Chinese state firms, introduced in a bid to prevent capitals moving out of the country, and European fears China is gaining too much access into sensitive information via state-backed companies such as tech giant Huawei.The researchers said in their study: “This decline is very much in line with a further drop in China’s global outbound FDI, a trend that can be attributed to continued capital controls and tightening of liquidity in China as well as growing regulatory scrutiny in host economies.”    "

Later this week, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is due to deepen the EU’s China crisis by signing a memorandum of understanding with Mr Xi on Beijing’s $1.2 trillion Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) plan which he hopes will be a magic pot of gold to paying off Rome’s staggering debt. Related articles   EU CRISIS: France and Italy row ESCALATES – ‘Alps just got HIGHER’   EU: Italy ignores France and Germany opposition to seek China deal Italy has invoked the spirit of Marco Polo and the booming Venetian Republic by hailing the BRI as a new ‘Silk Road’, harking back to centuries of trading traditions between the two countries when Venice was final stop on the famous merchant route.However Brussels is increasingly wary of sinister undertones in China’s economic scheme which it says distracts recruited countries with promises of mega-investment and throws the door open to Beijing’s strategic and military ambitions.Italy would become the world’s biggest economy to sign up to the BRI, which has so far targeted developing countries in Africa and Asia and commits participants to strengthening their political relations, commercial ties, and promoting regional peace.The plan promises deeper integration in transport, logistics and infrastructure projects including dual investment in the building of roads, railways, bridges, civil aviation, ports, energy and telecommunications as well as bilateral coordination on fiscal, financial and structural reform policies by developing partnerships between Italian and Chinese financial institutions.  Italy's leaders are risking the wrath of the EU by signing up to Xi Jinping's globalisation strategy (Image: GETTY)   The leap away from the EU’s arms into the Chinese embrace has raised major red flags in Brussels which has begged Italy not to go ahead with the memorandum.But officials in Rome are preparing to put pen to paper on the deal when Mr Xi visits the Palazzo Chigi on March 22, making Italy the first G7 country to endorse China’s ploy.Washington has also warned Italy against closer ties with Beijing, saying it risks exposing sensitive technologies to China.In a rare rebuke of an ally, a White House national security spokesman said there is “no need for Italian government to lend legitimacy to China's infrastructure vanity project.”However Matteo Salvini, Italian deputy prime minister and leader of the eurosceptic Lega party, has denied such a risk.

Chancellor Hammond is in China for talks (Image: GETTY)Mr Hammond last visited China in December, when both countries vowed to continue and strengthen cooperation on a wide range of economic, financial and trade issues, including speeding the introduction of a London-Shanghai stock connect program.The UK’s trade relationship with China is considered unremarkable with Britain, the world's sixth largest economy, sending just 3 percent of its exports of goods and services to China while just 7 percent of its imports are from China.UK-China trade currently stands at £63.56 billion ($84 billion), far below the £159.66 billion ($211 billion) in trade between Germany and China.Prime Minister May said during her trip to China last January “there are huge trade opportunities in China that we want to help British businesses take advantage of”.   Ahead of the trip she said she would “intensify the 'Golden Era' in UK-China relations”.However there remains plenty of work to be done and Mr Hammond will look to the progress made during his visit to last year’s Beijing summit celebrating President Xi Jinping’s landmark Belt and Road infrastructure program to build a new Silk Road, which has aroused suspicion in some Western capitals that it is more about expanding China’s influence than anything else.Mr Hammond said: “Britain is an ideal cooperation partner to turn Belt and Road into a globally recognised asset class via London’s position as a global financial hub.“We hope that Britain can grasp the unlimited opportunities brought by the Belt and Road initiative, and take a lead in its financing work.”  Chancellor Hammond is looking for a Brexit boost from China (Image: GETTY)"

But in China’s case, it will still overtake the US in 13 years, the study has predicted. The consultancy's 2019 World Economic League Table was more downbeat on the global economy in comparison with last year's outlook.The report, which forecast the fortunes of 193 countries to 2033, states: ""For the medium term, we are roughly as optimistic as we were a year ago, but suspect the route to growth will be more bumpy than we had assumed 12 months ago.”US President Mr Trump threw down the gauntlet earlier this year after slapping tariffs on imports of 25 percent and ten percent on imports of Chinese steel and aluminium, triggering a series of tit-for-tat measures which some analysts will lead to a trade dispute which could last two decades.China is hit top spot in its ”league table” in 2032, two years later than previously expected, due to a more lax monetary policy and lower exchange rate, the CEBR said.The effects of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies have made themselves felt across global markets this year, and dented world trade growth.  Mr Trump holds up a Presidential memorandum against ""Chinese economic aggression"" earlier this year (Image: GETTY)The volume of world trade growth is likely to be up 2.99 percent this year, less than two-thirds of the increase in 2017, the CEBR estimates.Markets have suffered this year as investors fled risky assets, afraid monetary tightening from the world's central banks is removing too much support from the economy as a trade war weighs on growth.The report states: ”With debt high and many of the structural problems that caused the great recession still in existence, a global recession could be more difficult to resolve than its predecessors.”Douglas McWilliams, deputy chairman of the CEBR, said: ""We're in a world now where there's a sense that a certain degree of fiscal action will have to be applied in order to avoid the world falling flat on its face. Related articles   US rages at China: 'This is NOT ACCEPTABLE' - Trade war ESCALATING   ‘Slanderous!’ Furious China demands US and UK retract spying claims Government spending is likely to rise, both from fiscal easing and from discretionary spending, he added, saying he saw governments delivering more support than central banks.With many economies facing an infrastructure backlog and mega-projects such as China's Belt and Road ongoing, the CEBR forecasts global construction spending will rise from $11.5 billion to $27.4 billion or 15.5 percent of world GDP by 2033.Mr McWilliams expected the average fiscal deficit for the OECD area to come in at 5 percent of GDP in 2020, higher than the OECD's forecast of 3.2 percent.He added: ""A five percent spend is risking it a bit, but the developed economies are in a better position to take that risk than emerging economies.” Related articles   Global intelligence group Five Eyes STEPS UP to confront China   USA VS CHINA: New trade war warning as US hits out at China's 'unfa...

The move to support BRI has sparked concern in the EU, at a time when Italy’s populist coalition government has repeatedly clashed with Brussels. Brussels has recently labelled Beijing “a systemic rival” and Italy’s choice to forge ahead with the endorsement casts doubt on the unification of the EU.

In a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, Mr Xi stressed “cooperation is greater than competition” in an effort to reassure his EU partners.He said: “We shouldn’t be always worried about watching our back with suspicion while moving forward.“We want our development to benefit others and that’s the case with the BRI.” Mr Macron, for his part, called for the EU to forge a united front to confront Chinese advances in trade and technology.   The French centrist added that European firms needed better access to China (Image: Getty Images)Mr Macron aid: “Europe must be united and have a coherent message.

He also stressed that the BRI had to meet international norms.Mr Macron told a separate news conference on Tuesday: “We must… accelerate work underway between China and the European Union on modernising the WTO to better respond to issues around transparency, overcapacity, state subsidies and dispute settlement.”France and China signed deals worth billions of euros during Mr Xi’s visit, including a huge Airbus plane order, despite Paris’s hesitance to embrace the BRI project.

Islamabad denies harbouring militants, who move across the porous border with Afghanistan. China and Pakistan consider each other “all-weather friends” and have close diplomatic, economic and security ties.   GETTYMr Trump also committed the United States to an open-ended conflict in AfghanistanBeijing has its own security concerns in the region, in particular any links between militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan and Islamist groups China blames for violence in its far western region of Xinjiang. Foreign Minister Wang Yi met Pakistani Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua in Beijing on Tuesday, according to a statement today. He praised Pakistan's efforts to combat extremism and to secure the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a development initiative central to President Xi Jinping's global Belt and Road development plan. “Given the current complicated and changing international and regional situation, the strategic significance of China-Pakistan relations is even more prominent,” Foreign Minister Wang said. "

Related articles   The South China Sea dispute could be reignited in 2018   China will not take Trump seriously without REAL threat of FORCE  Xi’s ambition, to become the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong reflects a similar message to Mr Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ campaign message, but the US President can expect the frustrating barriers to his bold pledges to continue hampering his agenda this year.While Xi has very little domestic opposition to contend with, the Democrats and an increasing number of disillusioned Republicans look set to hamper even more of Mr Trump’s initiatives are a difficult first year for the Republican firebrand.If Mr Trump sees his Chinese counterpart sailing towards cementing his legacy while he struggles to enact his plans in the US, the leader is expected to lash out at Xi.There are also foreign affairs to deal with. President Trump is of the opinion that Beijing can single-handedly disarm the increasingly erratic North Korea, on behalf of Washington – something most of the rest of the world recognises is impossible.   Trump has swerved between praising China’s involvement in the North Korean crisis and condemning Beijing for not doing enough during his first year in office, but the President’s early 2018 tweets suggest a considerably more volatile foreign policy.He told the New York Times shortly after Christmas: “If they [China] don’t help us with North Korea, then I do what I’ve always said I want to do.”Mr Trump’s first tweet of the new year was an attack on Pakistan, accusing the country of lying and deceiving the United States and threatening to withdraw billions of dollars of aid.While India and Afghanistan praised the President’s condemnation of Pakistan, China rushed to defend the “great sacrifices” the country has made to combat terrorism.  GETTYXi welcomes Trump to Beijing during the President's Asia tour in NovemberChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said: “It has made a prominent contribution to global anti-terror efforts.""The international community should fully recognise this.""The thorny issue of trade remains unresolved too. Mr Trump had been expected to raise his concerns when he visited Asia at the end of last year but the lavish banquet laid on by President Xi appeared to cause Trump to drop the issue.However, the US President has repeatedly vowed to rectify what he sees as huge trade discrepancies between the US and China, and should Xi put nursing his own ego ahead of flattering Mr Trump, 2018 could prove rocky for Sino-US relations."

""We, as Europeans, want to play an active part (in the Belt and Road project),"" Merkel said after the talks. ""That must lead to certain reciprocity, and we are still wrangling over that a bit.""Juncker, who will host an EU-China summit in Brussels next month, reinforced EU calls for better trade reciprocity so that ""European businesses could have the same degree of access to the Chinese market as Chinese businesses have in Europe.""The Belt and Road Initiative, championed by Xi, aims to link China by sea and land with Southeast and Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa, through an infrastructure network along the lines of the old Silk Road.France says any Silk Road-style cooperation must work in both directions. Even as he presided over the signing of trade deals with China worth tens of billions of dollars this week, including an Airbus deal to sell 300 aircraft to China's state buying agency, Macron pushed back against Beijing's rights record and ambitions."

The organisation will be campaigning this year for better careers advice and people under the age of 16 to be given at least four chances of trying their hand at different fields of work.A focus will also be put on technical skills as the group wishes to help provide better technical education, apprenticeships and reselling adults.They will also be working on commercialising research out of UK universities, in an attempt to improve the UK’s poor productivity.Also the CBI in a bid to promote infrastructure is applying pressure to such projects as the expansion of Heathrow and the HS2 rail link."

Related articles   World War 3: Pakistan WORRIED about India ‘PREDATOR DRONE technology'   World War 3: India seeks APACHE HELICOPTERS from Donald Trump “Its deployments must cover areas where it has traditionally maintained a low presence.“It urgently needs to develop its border infrastructure, engaging multiple civil entities through the relevant army commanders, and not only through the Border Roads Organisation.“It also needs to establish a comprehensive surveillance grid, and launch multiple small satellites by the Indian Space Research Organisation to monitor the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China on a 24/7 basis.“This means it also needs to centralise its border control of the LAC and put in place systemic measures to control fault lines of its adversaries.   “This is the biggest strategic challenge the Indian government faces.”Last year, Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat expressed his deep concern for a war on two fronts with China and Pakistan.He stated China had started to “flex its muscles” and had begun “taking over territory in a very gradual manner”.General Rabat continued: “As far as our northern adversary is concerned flexing of muscles has started.“Salami slicing, taking over territory in a very gradual manner, testing our limits of threshold is something we have to be wary of and remain prepared for such situations, which could gradually emerge into conflict.“As far as our western adversary is concerned, we don’t see any scope of reconciliation, because the military, polity and people of that nation have been made to believe that their eastern adversary, which is India, is all out to break the nation into pieces.“Therefore, the kind of propaganda that is prevailing on to our west, makes them believe that India is their long-term adversary and will continue to remain so.”   Mr Katoch explained that Pakistan’s “foreign and defence policies” could be influenced by China following reports Xi Jinping could be planning to add to the tension in the region of Jammu and Kashmir.He went on: “20 rounds of talks on the India-China boundary have yielded little and there is a need to address questions of an escalation by Pakistan at China’s behest.“This also raises questions about whether Pakistan’s foreign and defence policies are influenced by China.“Has Pakistan become a de facto Chinese province with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and Belt and Road Initiative?“Dispassionate analyses would conclude that this is a real possibility.“Reports in the Chinese media threaten that the People’s Liberation Army could enter the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir and China could destabilise India’s northeast and separate it from India.  GettyGeneral Bipin Rawat expressed his deep concern for a war on two fronts with China and Pakistan“In sum, China and Pakistan are one entity threatening India on multiple fronts.”The former lieutenant discussed China’s “adept” skill for taking territory without resorting to “direct conflict”.He remarked: “China is adept at nibbling territory, and going by the experience of the Doklam crisis, it never seeks direct conflict.  GettyMr Katoch explained that Pakistan’s 'foreign and defence policies' could be influenced by China“It calls an area 'disputed,' and then occupies it by proclaiming it as Chinese territory.“That is what China is likely to do with India, particularly its northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which is called 'Southern Tibet' by China.“If there is a confrontation by India, which would be natural, Beijing is likely to blame the escalation on New Delhi.”"

In military terms, the threats we face range from Russia successfully testing a hypersonic nuclear missile to confrontation against China. We will also have to consider tackling Islamic State and its affiliates in Syria, Nigeria and at home. Related articles   World War 3 fears EXPLODE as Russia tests new NUCLEAR bomber   WW3 ALERT: US in SHOCK as Putin moves supersonic bombers in Caribbean  In cyber terms, these players represent a clear and present danger that could trigger a Nato crisis or deliberate attacks on our national infrastructure. That each of them seek to undermine the global order is not news but, in a mark of the extraordinary times we live in, they are being encouraged in part by the US. As long as President Trump continues to pursue his America First doctrine, the US administration mirrors their disrespect to international institutions.   US President Donald Trump (Image: SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)Despite the budget crisis, Britain remains a Tier 1 military power, theoretically able to deploy a sizeable force to any hotspot, either alone or with allies. The post-Iraq “gun shyness” which has seen us focus on training missions is slowly giving way to a new political confidence to take action. But as we embark on a new chapter outside the EU, we will have to carefully balance trade with threat, and pragmatism with principle. Related articles   WW3: Putin’s nuclear-armed drone sub ‘could trigger 300ft tsunami'   Donald Trump: US leader hints at trade deal SUCCESS with China  CHINAIn a year which has seen Russia carry out a nerve attack on British soil, it may surprise some that China should be placed top of our list of threats. But the reason is simple. Russia’s may provide real challenges for the next decade, or however long before it is that before Putin retires from ill health, but China’s threat is institutional, and not reliant on any single individual.China’s belt and road initiative has already seen its global reach grow as it invests heavily in Africa, Europe and Asia, providing  infrastructure at crippling terms of interest. Private and state-owned Chinese firms have acquired stakes in eight major European maritime ports. And where it has an economic presence, its navy acts like a shadow. As it continues to exert an stranglehold in the South China Sea - the worlds’ most important trade route and the most likely flashpoint for military engagement - its PLA Navy now operates naval exercise thousands of miles from its shores.  Chinese firms have acquired stakes in eight major European maritime ports (Image: Li Tang/VCG via Getty Images)China’s drive to modernise its armed forces saw it increase defence spending by 8.1 per cent last year. While, at £146bn, it is still dwarfed by the US, its focus on naval and air power is impressive, with hypersonic missiles that  travel six times faster than the speed of sound. It means the window countries have to assess and defend becomes dangerously small. A subsonic missile launched from China’s eastern seaboard at 0.8 Mach could take 18 minutes to hit Taiwan, while a Mach 10 could hit pay-dirt in just 90 seconds.  China should be placed top of our list of threats (Image: Luo Huibo/VCG via Getty Images)If the likelihood of a nuclear strike is remote, and we file clashes in the South China Sea as tomorrow’s problem, consider that China’s cyber weapons are already being used. According to the National Cyber Security Centre the state-sponsored Apt 10 group is already stealing industrial secrets and IP from Europe, Asia and the US in “one of the most significant and widespread cyber intrusions against the UK and allies uncovered to date”. Add our desire for its 5G technology and need to trade in the mix , and we are left with out most challenging foe. The fact that it will become the world’s largest economy without being a democracy or adhering to human rights norms means we will have to work hard to draw red lines.  Related articles   Putin's 2019 DOMINATION: Russia plots New Year path   World War 3 fears EXPLODE as Russia tests new NUCLEAR bomber RUSSIA Relations with Russia remain at freezing temperature following the Salisbury attacks. Earlier this month General Mark Carleton-Smith, head of the British Army, warned that Vladimir Putin presents a greater threat to UK national interest than Islamic State terrorists.Moscow’s recent confirmation that it has properly joined the hypersonic missile club should worry us all, for the reasons stated above. The  decision of both the US and Russia to pull out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty  means we face a stark challenge.Much more likely, however, is that Vladimir Putin tests the resolve of Nato with an Article 5 challenge, either in Ukraine - where recently it took control of the narrow Kerch Strait, denying access to the Ukrainian port of Mariupol-  or one of its former areas of control such as Estonia, where British troops are based.    Again, cracks in the world order may offer Vladimir Putin a temptation too far - in this case, the US’ commitment to Nato. Up to now, Trumpanian rhetoric was balanced by assurances from able members of his cabinet that he didn't mean it. In fact the US added a new armoured brigade and an extra £1.1bn to the European defence plan. But defence secretary Gen Jim Mattis’ resignation has caused even the Ministry of Defence to consider the once unthinkable prospect of the US quitting Nato.

Europe’s two great military powers, Britain and France, cannot carry the weight of Russian deterrence without US support.Talk of a so-called EU defence force is merely political wallpaper.Meanwhile Russia continues to carry out influence campaigns with impunity, its troll farms operating from St Petersburg and third nations, while its intelligence services carry out nefarious black ops.When it comes to Europe, Putin has another card to play: EU members, particularly Germany, rely on its gas exports.

Most who escaped headed for North Africa, where Libya continues to provide fertile respite to reorganise and plan attacks in Europe. But it is Africa that we must now look to.Flashpoint include Nigeria where Boko Haram now dominates, and the Sahel, that band which links the Sahara to the Savannah and which contains, according to US military experts, “probably the largest card-carrying group” of Islamic State members outside Iraq and Syria.” While French-led forces are already taking steps in Mali, Britain’s contribution is limited to providing helicopters.  This may well change next year.  Related articles   ISIS 2.0 RISING: Interpol sends SHOCK warning of SECOND WAVE of terror   Gatwick: Army sends for equipment that beats IS NORTH AND SOUTH POLESSpecial mention must go to the Arctic and Antarctica, where Russia and China have both ramped up operations to dominate.

Its partnership with Russia, which wants to exploit gas and benefit from the new route, sees the area turning into a flashpoint for conflict.   Britain remains a Tier 1 military power (Image: Lockheed Martin/Ministry of Defence via Getty Images)It is little wonder that Britain, one of the first four observers to the Artic Council, will begin to station RAF fighter jets there for the first time, while sending a Royal Marine contingent for the long winter months. Antarctica is also a magnet for both countries, not only in terms of mineral wealth but also as the perfect launching pad for satellites which will help both countries create GPS systems to match the US.China spends more there than anywhere else, a fact that should hit home."

Having outlasted nearly all of their 1960s contemporaries, the most famous band to be belting out hits well into old age (the four current members have a combined age of more than 288 years) were also the first British band to be actively promoted as bad boys back in the 1960s.  The gimmick stuck as an image (partly because it was true).  With hair longer than any other group and an attitude that made The Beatles look like choir boys, the Stones took full advantage of their image as “the group parents love to hate”.  They were the first band to be seen urinating in public – something that The Beatles would never have done.Their version of the blues standard Little Red Rooster, which had become a British No.1 in 1965, was the first song by a British band to be banned in the US because of its “objectionable lyrics” – something that delighted the Stones’ then-manager Andrew Loog Oldham who had urged them to record it precisely to maintain their bad boy image.In 1978 Stones’ guitarist Keith Richards became the first pop artist in history to be ordered by a judge to play two free concerts in lieu of the usual minimum seven-year prison sentence for importing narcotics into Canada.  The band played Toronto to apologise after 22 grams of heroin was found in his room.   GETTYKeith Richards was once sentenced to play two free gigs after heroin was found in his hotel roomIn February 1986, two days after playing a private tribute show at London’s 100 Club for Ian Stewart – the band’s original pianist and road manager who had died of a heart attack the previous December – they became the first British band to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grammys.  Previous recipients included Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra.  The Beatles did not win the same accolade until January 2014. In November 1994, the band broadcast 20 minutes of live audio and video from a performance in Dallas the week before.  The event was one of the first examples of streaming, and made the Stones the first major rock band to broadcast on the internet.  In December 1998, the Stones became the first rock’n’roll band to perform in RussiaAs pioneers of corporate sponsorship, their 1997 worldwide tour saw the biggest deal ever done when long-distance carrier Sprint paid £2.5 million to print its company logo on tickets and stage banners. In December 1998, they were the first rock’n’roll band to perform in Russia.  They first applied to perform in Moscow in 1967 but were banned after Soviet officials went to watch them play a concert in Warsaw, Poland, and didn’t like what they saw.  Fans came from as far as Siberia to attend the show.   GETTYMick Jagger talking to rock'n'roll pioneer Chuck BerryTheir 2005 A Bigger Bang Tour over 147 dates set a record at £1.15 million in gross receipts in less than four months.  Overall, the tour – which lasted for two years – earned a staggering £395 million, and was the highest-grossing tour of all time until overtaken by U2’s 360 Degrees Tour, which took place from 2009-2011. In 2013, the Stones made their Glastonbury debut in a performance considered by many the best ever by a reigning British rock band and described by organiser Michael Eavis as: “the high spot of 43 years of Glastonbury”. The following year, the band touched down in Tel Aviv aboard their private jet, emblazoned with their tongue logo, and accompanied by 70 staff for a historic visit – the first performance in Israel by one of the two bands that founded modern popular music.  The Beatles’ Paul McCartney performed in September 2008.Related articles   The essential guide for the legend: David Bowie in his own words  Freedom is music to their ears as Brexit beauties take pop at voters  'Hola Habana!'

The plane's fuselage was shown by local media half submerged in the Keelung River.Wu Jun-hong, a Taipei Fire Department official who is coordinating the rescue, told reporters at the scene: ""At the moment, things don't look too optimistic.""Those in the front of the plane are likely to have lost their lives.""The Ministry of National Defence said it had sent 165 people and eight boats to the rescue scene.Taipei's fire crew is also assisting with rescue efforts.Survivors wearing life jackets were seen wading clear of the debris.Injured people have been pictured being loaded into ambulances.  REXPassenger jet carrying 58 people crashes into river, Taipei, TaiwanRescue teams are continuing to search for survivors among the wreckage.Another child, named as Lin Riyao, is now reportedly fighting for his life in intensive care after suffering from too much water entering his lungs.The two-year-old was travelling with his parents, Lin Mingwei and his school teacher wife Jiang Yuying, according to reports in Hong Kong's Apple Daily.The manager of Taiwanese travel agent Flying Tourism told the Guardian that they had 15 mainland Chinese tourists on the plane.The manager, who gave his name as Mr Hsu, said that he had only confirmed one injured passenger, which was one of the two children on board.One volunteer rescue worker said: ""I've never seen anything like this.

We are very sorry.""TransAsia Airways will do its utmost to help our passengers, the injured, as well as the families of the passengers on board.""We will deploy all our resources to help in the rescue efforts as well as in the aftermath of this incident.""  IGA tiny child was pulled safely from the wreckage   A TransAsia media officer declined comment on possible reasons for the crash and deferred to a news conference later today.Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration was also unable to discuss possible causes of the crash.Lin Tyh-ming, the head of Taiwan's civil aviation authority, said the aircraft last underwent maintenance on January 26. The pilot had 4,916 hours of flying hours under his belt and the co-pilot had 6,922 hours, he said.This is not the first time that a TransAsia flight has been involved in such an incident in recent months.A jet operated by the airline crashed in the outlying Taiwan-controlled islands of Penghu last July, killing 48.

99,"Brian G Hutton. Film Director. January 1, 1935 - August 19, 2014. Aged 79",https://www.express.co.uk//news/obituaries/504858/Obituary-Film-Director-Brian-G-Hutton-aged-79," PUBLISHED:  00:01, Sat, Aug 30, 2014 ","Brian G Hutton directed classics such as Where Eagles dare and Kelly's Heroes [GETTY]He was a relatively inexperienced, unknown film director who had only three low-budget movies under his belt at the time but the film’s star Richard Burton had the final say over who would get to direct.As as soon as he knew Hutton’s parents were Welsh he welcomed the rookie director aboard. “He and I used to sing Welsh songs together,” Hutton once recalled.“But he used to laugh because my Welsh was actually very bad.”Despite the film’s enduring appeal and the fact that it was box office gold when it was released Hutton was always surprised at the success the movie had.“I’ve got to tell you, I look at it and I think to myself, ‘Gee, I wonder who did that?’” he once told an ­interviewer.”He added: “After that, of course, I got offers to make 50 other action pictures but I didn’t want to make any. I made two and that was enough.”Born in New York, Hutton started his career as an actor, honing his talent at the famous Actors Studio.Eastwood and Burton in the Second World war classic  [MGM/KOBAL]It wasn’t long before he landed supporting roles in major TV series such as Perry Mason, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Rawhide, where he met Clint Eastwood.He also had small roles in films such as Gunfight At The OK Corral, Last Train From Gun Hill and King Creole starring Elvis Presley.But by 1965, Hutton was keen to try his hand at directing and made the little-seen Wild Seed for Marlon Brando’s Pennebaker Productions.His follow-up, The Pad And How To Use It, based on a play by Peter Shaffer, was a hip, sexually provocative comedy about a swinging bachelor which proved far more successful when it was released a year later.Before Where Eagles Dare he squeezed in The Heroin Gang starring Telly Savalas and David McCallum but it’s the 1968 classic starring Burton and Eastwood for which he will be best remembered.Perhaps even more impressive than the action on screen was the fact that Hutton was able to keep notorious hellraiser Burton in check, something director Martin Ritt had failed to do a couple years earlier on The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, when Burton’s drinking played havoc with the production.In 1969 Hutton started work on Kelly’s Heroes, a light-hearted movie about a group of Second World War soldiers who go Awol to rob a bank behind enemy lines.It meant working again with Eastwood, who became a lifelong friend.

When I finished the second Elizabeth Taylor picture I thought, ‘Well, what am I wasting my life doing this for?Brian G HuttonAlthough the film went on to become a worldwide hit, the post-production period was a nightmare after the studio ordered the movie to be drastically cut.For Hutton it signalled the beginning of the end of his Hollywood career. He made a couple more films with Elizabeth Taylor, including Night Watch in 1973.However by then he’d already lost his enthusiasm for film-making.“It wasn’t something I wanted to do to begin with – not my life’s work,” he later admitted.He added: “When I finished the second Elizabeth Taylor picture I thought, ‘Well, what am I wasting my life doing this for?’“I mean, a gorilla could have made those movies. All I had to do was yell ‘Action’ and ‘Cut-Print’ because ­everybody was doing what they had to do anyway.”After a seven-year hiatus he returned to the big screen to make The First Deadly Sin and High Road To China before leaving Hollywood behind in the mid-1980s for a career in real estate.He suffered a heart attack a week before he died and is survived by his wife Victoria."

101,Volvo Polestar launch first electric car and vows to be 'leaders in electrification',https://www.express.co.uk//life-style/cars/867984/volvo-polestar-1-launch-electric-car-plug-in," 13:47, Wed, Oct 18, 2017 ","  POLESTARVolvo launches its new Polestar performance brand this weekThe Swedish firm invented the three-point seat belt and then generously gave away the patent to allow other car manufacturers to follow suit.It also had the first rear-facing child safety seat and was the first car maker to fit side impact bags.But of all its world firsts, the one on 5 July of this year will probably go down as its biggest.That was the date that Volvo announced that from 2019 every new car it introduces would have electric power of some description with five fully electric models launched by 2021.Volvo President Hakan Samuelsson says that he wants Volvo to be ""leaders in electrification"".And now the Swedish firm has gone one step closer to achieving that, with the launch this week of its new Polestar performance brand which will not only be electric-powered across all of its future models, but will also be innovative in the market in other ways too.An battery-powered rival to Porsche's 911, Polestar's cars will feature a light-weight carbon-fibre body (the same high-tech material used in Formula One cars) and also initially be sold exclusively via a subscription-only service similar to a leasing finance scheme.

If you thought that Volvo's XC90 and XC60 were smart, then this Polestar 1 is something else again.""Polestar 1 is the first car to carry the Polestar on the bonnet,"" says Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar CEO.""A beautiful GT with amazing technology packed into it - a great start for our new Polestar brand. All future cars from Polestar will feature a fully electric drivetrain, delivering on our brand vision of being the new standalone electric performance model.""

POLESTARPolestar 1 will need more than just startling performance and high-tech to succeedQuite how customers will react to this new system of buying a car (or more to the point, [start itals] not [end itals] buying it) is another matter.When many new cars are now sold through purchase lease arrangements for two or three years, it certainly seems to make sense.Other manufacturers like Porsche are launching similar schemes too, so Volvo clearly isn't alone in its thinking.That said, Polestar Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Goodman won't rule out the possibility of selling future Polestar models outright as well as via this scheme.Ah yes, future models, this is just the start for Polestar.The second model, called imaginatively Polestar 2, will start production in late 2019 and be closer to the current Volvo S60 in size, while a third model, a larger 4x4 crossover, joins the range in 2021.   That's still some way off yet though as an all-new factory has still yet to be built in Chengdu, China.Its green credentials mean that it will be the most environmentally-friendly car factory in China.That's a crucial statement given that China is the world's largest car market and also the world's largest producer of electric vehicles.By 2030, Goldman Sachs is already estimating that China will account for 60 per cent of all hybrid and electric vehicle sales globally.While sales of alternatively-fuelled vehicles is undoubtedly on the rise in Europe, the numbers are eye-poppingly huge there with the Chinese Government aiming for production of 7 million hybrid and electric vehicles by 2025.It already has almost three times more charging points than the US.As all markets have found though, electric car sales often only really succeed when supported by Government subsidies and also by sufficient infrastructure for charging points.BMW has already taken that first step with its i8 supercar showing that battery power and sports car performance can go hand in hand.Volvo's new Polestar brand and this stunning new Polestar 1 look like they could be the next lesson for the industry.  GETTYThe Polestar 1 will have exclusivity on its sidePlug-in Volvos spark salesIn reality, Volvo isn't starting from scratch with its knowledge of battery-powered vehicles.It would be a vast understatement to say that the plug-in versions of its XC90 and new XC60 have been a massive success.Appealing particularly to those keen to reduce their company car tax bills thanks to their sub 50g/km emissions, Volvo hugely underestimated just how popular they would be.The plug-in XC90 T8, the flagship in the range, now accounts for around a quarter of all XC90 sales.It's not by mistake that Volvo has enjoyed three consecutive years of record sales worldwide, both the XC90 and XC60 have been the right cars at the right time."
