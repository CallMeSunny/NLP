PAThe Duke of Cambridge and young conservationistsThe Duke visited the Xishuangbanna nature reserve where around 250 of the animals live in the wild in the sanctuary.He met one of them, Ran Ran, a 13-year-old female, who was discovered in a jungle river in 2005 with a leg wound caused by a trap, baskets of carrots.He rubbed her trunk and gave her a scratch between the eyes as Xiong Chaoyong, the animal's keeper, handed carrots from a basket to the Duke which were gratefully taken by Ran Ran.Prince William kept feeding and at one point the elephant's mouth was crammed full while she still had her trunk wrapped around another four carrots.The Duke told Ran Ran "you're going to get indigestion" and after another basket full of carrots was quickly eaten, added: "You're going to get a runny tummy."Prince William also  met with conservationist and wildlife photographer Xi Zhinong, who showed him pictures he had taken of animals, such as monkeys, cranes and the endangered pangolin.The Duke told him: "What you do with your pictures is to help education and conserve the natural world for the next generation. Your work is remarkable."The quality of your work is such that it must take a lot of patience to achieve."He also met young rangers who were painting a model elephant and they asked William to join them.Picking up a brush, the Duke said: "I hope you know that the future of these animals are down to your generation. You are the ones that are going to have to speak up."  PAThe Prince saw pictures taken by Chinese conservationist Xi ZhinongPrince William's visit came at the end of a seven-day tour of Japan and China and in an impromptu meeting with the British press he said he had enjoyed his trip.Speaking at Xishuangbanna he said: "I've had a truly wonderful visit to Japan and China. I've met lots of wonderful people - a very warm reception, and I really enjoyed myself."I look forward to building on relationships and building on partnerships going forward and doing as much collaboration as possible in a number of areas. "But it's been very enjoyable and I have had a great time."Prince William was not joined by his wife Kate, who is expecting a younger sibling for Prince George next month.
