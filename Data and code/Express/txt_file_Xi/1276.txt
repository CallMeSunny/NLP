  GETTYThe political instability of Europe has topped a list of biggest risks the world faces in 2015Continued friction among European Union states is rated as a higher problem than even the violent threat of the so-called Islamic State and Russia's actions in the Ukraine."I’m very far from a pessimist" said Ian Bremmer, founder of New York-based Eurasia Group, who published the list."But for the first time since starting the firm in 1998, I’m starting to feel a serious undercurrent of geopolitical foreboding."The group put the politics of Europe in the top slot after a year that has seen the UK heading ever increasingly towards the exit following disagreements over immigration levels and benefits to migrants.The woeful state of the euro has also prompted many to think Greece will also leave the bloc.The fear is followed by the issues in Russia, the growth of the terror group and the economic slowdown of China.Also featured on the top ten was the weaponisation of finance, the underwhelming political victories of several countries and growing concerns surrounding Turkey.THE TOP GEOPOLITICAL RISKS OF 20151. The politics of Europe"Europe's economics are in substantially better shape than at the height of the Eurozone crisis. But the politics is now much worse," writes Mr Bremmer.The social instability and continued friction among EU states is the biggest risk the world faces in 2015.The external political environment is also proving to be more challenging, with concerns over potential security incidents between Europe and the Russian military higher than ever before.  GETTYRussia came in at number two2. RussiaPresident Putin is unlikely to reverse the tensions that have mounted in Ukraine, according to the list.As sanctions and lower oil prices continue to weaken Russia, Putin's approval from his country will depend increasingly on his willingness to confront the West."In sum, Russia is a power whose geopolitical ambitions are rising precisely at the moment that its economic fortunes are declining," said Mr Bremmer.3. The effects of China slowdownThe economic slowdown that President Xi Jinping has demanded will have little impact inside China, according to the report.However, it means those countries who demand commodity exports from China will have to learn to cope with this new reality.As well as this, a massive pitfall may well come from Thailand, where a slump in commodity prices driven by weaker demand in China will dampen economic growth prospects.4. Weaponisation of financeWashington is accessing capital markets and using varied types of sanctions to weaponise finance on a new scale.However, this strategy will damage its relations, particularly with Europe, warned the list.Mr Bremmer adds: "In the background looms the ultimate threat: that the United States will financially isolate rogue states by severing their access to capital and the infrastructure used to clear payments."  PAThe list said the ideological reach of ISIS could spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa5. ISIS, beyond Iraq and SyriaThe ideological reach of ISIS could spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa in 2015, according to the list."It will grow organically by setting up new units in Yemen, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, and it will inspire many jihadist organisations to join its ranks," he said.Therefore, risk to neighbouring states will worsen as the threat of the terror group grows.6. Weak incumbents"The weakness of so many incumbents in important emerging market states will weigh on both global growth and political stability in 2015," writes Mr Bremmer.He says the underwhelming victories in Brazil, South Africa, Nigeria, Turkey and Columbia will ensure each political party is stretched to their limits as they push their respective political agendas.7. The rise of strategic sectorsSuccess and failure for business in 2015 will depend on governments, according to the report.In the wake of the Sony hack, entertainment companies across the globe are thinking carefully about any North Korea-related content.While in the US, they have expanded their military industrial complex to include a wide range of technology, telecommunications and financial companies.  GETTYThe tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran will intensify this year8. Saudi Arabia vs. IranThe tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran will intensify this year and cause more conflict in the Middle East, warned the list."Tehran and Riyadh will have very different approaches toward Iraq's Prime Minister Haidar al Abadi," he writes."The Saudis will press for maximum inclusion of Sunnis in Iraq's government."9. Taiwan/ChinaRelations between Taiwan and China will deteriorate this year following the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) victory over the ruling nationalist party in November, according to the report."If China decides that its economic engagement strategy with Taiwan has failed to advance its end goal of reunification, Beijing may well take a more confrontational approach by backtracking on already agreed trade and investment accords and by hardening its rhetoric," writes Mr Bremmer.These developments could then affect US-China ties.10. TurkeyPresident Erdogan is unlikely to win the new powers he craves this year, which could force more political fighting and unpredictability.Meanwhile, refugees are bringing more radicalism into Turkey, adding to the county's economic troubles.Lasting peace with the Kurds, who want President Erdogan to fight the Islamic State, is also looking increasingly unstable.
