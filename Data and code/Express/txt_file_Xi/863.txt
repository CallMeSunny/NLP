    Addressing South Korea’s National Assembly last Wednesday Mr Trump insisted that the US would “not be intimidated” by Kim Jong-un’s rhetoric and called for other countries to respond to the “twisted regimes” threats with a sign of military force.He also warned the “three largest aircraft carriers in the world are appropriately positioned" to face Pyongyang.Prior to his intervention in South Korea, Mr Trump had previously suggested he was ready to use the US military to attack the rogue country.At the start of last month, he said his Secretary of State’s efforts to negotiate with North Korea were a waste of time.   On Twitter, he said: "I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man...“…Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!"Being nice to Rocket Man hasn't worked in 25 years, why would it work now? Clinton failed, Bush failed, and Obama failed. I won't fail."
