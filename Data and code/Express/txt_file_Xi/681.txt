  GETTYThe EU has warned China over steel 'dumping'But attempts to limit the tide of cheap Chinese imports seem doomed to fail. At a meeting with Chinese premier Xi Jinping, European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker revealed the EU would take action against Chinese steel ‘dumping’.

I am determined, together with European Council President Donald Tusk, to defend the interests of the European steel industry and its workers.”  GETTYThe thorny issue has led to protectionismDefences against China have become an increasing problem for Brussels since it was forced to acknowledge in July that, under World Trade Organisation rules, EU countries would have to start treating Beijing as an industrialised “market economy” in trade disputes.This means that, from next year, the 28 EU countries in the world’s biggest trade bloc can no longer use the tough measures they used to be able to deploy against “non-market economies”.Diplomats confirmed that the EU is studying ways to hit exporters with massive overcapacity with the sort of sky-high tariff levels seen in the US but added that Brussels faces two major obstacles to switching over to this new system.First, the EU has encountered persistent problems with obtaining reliable data on Chinese companies, something which has particularly plagued anti-subsidy investigations. Proving overcapacity at a particular Chinese steel mill is likely to prove difficult without Chinese cooperation.  GETTYEU chiefs called on the Chinese to reveal who was overproducingFlustered Mr Juncker belied the EU’s impotence by insisting China tells them who is overproducing. He said: “It is crucial that China accepts to set-up a mechanism to monitor overcapacity in the steel sector and its causes. “We discussed the matter at the last EU-China summit in July and we agreed on a bilateral working group.”Giving little away, Chinese President Xi Jinping said: “Overcapacity is a global problem but there is a particular Chinese element.”
