    Just moments before, the President-elect took aim at North Korea for attempting to develop nuclear weapons to be used against the US.The Republican business tycoon tweeted: “North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!”   In his New Year’s address, Kim Jong-un toyed with global nuclear war fears as he claimed his nuclear ICBM weapon was “in its final stages of testing”.The North Korean leader told his brainwashed nation that the weapon would make their country a “military power of the east that cannot be touched even by the strongest enemy”.Although North Korea is said be greatly exaggerating their military power, a US expert warned leaders to take Jong-un's threats seriously.Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate at the Middleburg Institute of International Studies at Monterrey, California said they have made considerable progress.

    Ms Hanham added: “The bottom line is Pyongyang is much further along in their missile development than most people realise.“The liquid engine test was astounding. For years we knew that North Korea had a Soviet R-27 missile engine design. They re-engineered the design of that engine to double its propulsion.”“2016 marked the year North Korea truly ramped up their WD programme. I think we’re going to see a [ICBM] flight test in 2017.”  GETTYThe 70-year-old billionnaire and avid Twitter user is due to take office on January 20Trump has previously hinted that he will take a hard-line with despot Kim, who has said he would make the communist leader “disappear” and also branded him a “maniac”.But he later said he would be willing to invite the "influential" North Korean leader to Washington for talks over hamburgers.
