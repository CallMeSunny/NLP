   This is a slightly better start than last week’s pairing high of $1.416.Despite the pound advancing against the US dollar and other peers such as the euro today, the latest UK economic news has been broadly negative.Data from New York based think tank the Conference Board suggests that UK productivity levels will fail to rise in line with Eurozone countries in 2018, due to lingering Brexit-associated damage.According to the Conference Board’s findings, Eurozone productivity levels are tipped to rise by 1.1 per cent in 2018, while the UK is on course for slower growth at 0.8 per cent.

       President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are strong personalities on the global stage, so these events could well be the opening skirmishes of a full-blown trade war.Looking ahead, the pound to US dollar exchange rate could rise further when Confederation of British Industry (CBI) trade data is released on Wednesday.Estimates are for a small rise in the trade-measuring index from 8 points to 11; this might spark a small GBP/USD exchange rate rise.There is the chance of a US dollar recovery this afternoon when Federal Reserve officials William Dudley and Loretta Mester speak.Mrs Mester is considered a ‘hawkish’ policymaker, so could boost the US dollar by speaking in favour of there being four US interest rate hikes in 2018.
