    Net users began referring to Peppa as “shehuiren” which literally means “societal person” but is often used as an euphemism for potential troublemakers or people who run counter to society's norm.The fifth season of the cartoon released last October racked up 10 billion views across China's social video platforms, according to Beijing Youth Daily.The frenzy with the character also began when net users shared Peppa-branded merchandise such as clothing, books, watches, plush toys, keyrings and even temporary tattoos.
