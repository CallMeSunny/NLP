It would be an exaggeration to call it a cold war, though relations are heading in that directionMark FitzpatrickUS-based Mr Fitzpatrick told Express.co.uk: "US-China relations are certainly frosty, with the high-stakes tariff tit for tat and mutual flexing of muscles at sea. "It would be an exaggeration to call it a cold war, though relations are heading in that direction."China takes utterly seriously its claim on Taiwan and is very sensitive about the heightened tempo of US ships sailing through the Taiwan Strait. "What Beijing will do about it is not clear, but it has various forms of leverage, including via the stranglehold it could put on trade and travel between Taiwan and the mainland."  US President Donald Trump with defence secretary James Mattis (Image: GETTY)Beijing had shown a greater willingness to confront the US directly in recent years, while not crossing any lines which could spark a military conflict, Mr Fitzpatrick said.He added: “The US government as a whole is well aware of the significance of the One China policy, which the US has accepted since the presidency of Richard Nixon. "But Donald Trump himself has not always appreciated it. "It is one of the many foundation stones of US foreign policy that he seems willing to disturb."

The Secretary reassured Minister Wei that we haven't changed ourTaiwan policy, our one China policy.”
