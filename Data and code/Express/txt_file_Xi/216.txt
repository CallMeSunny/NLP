    The People’s Liberation Army Navy has been expanding rapidly in recent years, and according to the Royal United Services Institute.They said: "It is hard to recall growth at a similar pace in any navy across history.”Wang Yunfei said China want have as many machines as the US Navy; ten carriers and nine smaller amphibious assault ships.China has not confirmed how many carriers they intend to build in total but, it was reported in May the PLA would want six carriers to protect China’s interests in a “worst-case scenario.”The Liaoning was originally built by the Soviet Union in 1985. It was known as the Varyag, before being bought by Chin from Ukraine in 1998, and renamed in 2012.   China’s military power has exploded in recent years, using technological advances and espionage to help build a powerful armed forces.In March, President Xi Jinping committed to transforming China’s military into the world’s most powerful force by 2050.The threat from Beijing is thought to have increased in recent years, according to one security analysis between 2006 and 2013 the Chinese military stole confidential data from more than 140 organisations around the world.The problem was so serious that in 2014 the US Department of Justice indicted five Chinese military hackers for cyber espionage.
