   BEIJING has announced plans to introduce import taxes on 5,207 US products worth $60billion in response to trade tariffs on Chinese goods imposed by Washington.The tariffs, which will come into force straight away if Washington goes ahead with its plans to levy taxes on Chinese imports, would range from 5 percent to 25 percent.In an official statement, the Chinese government said: “The implementation date of the taxation measures will be subject to the actions of the US, and China reserves the right to continue to introduce other countermeasures.“Any unilateral threat or blackmail will only lead to intensification of conflicts and damage to the interests of all parties.” Related articles   Germany news: German firms now HIT by Trump's tariffs on £200BN of ...

    China has shown no intention of retreating from the trade war and is refusing to back down.The proposed retaliation promises to further inflame tensions between the world’s two biggest economies.It mirrors China’s reaction to the previous round of tariffs last month, when the US and China imposed like-for-like punitive measures on $34billion worth of each other’s goods.Another $16billion in US levies on Chinese goods will likely follow in the coming days or weeks, which Beijing has assured it will retaliate against proportionally.Chinese authorities - bracing for economic fallout - have put a range of measures in place in recent weeks to attempt to bolster their economy.  The Trump administration is waging a tariff trade war with the Chinese.

Trump has been vocal in his censure of the US trade deficit with China. (Image: GETTY)  The weaker yuan indicates that investors have questions about the strength of China’s economy.
