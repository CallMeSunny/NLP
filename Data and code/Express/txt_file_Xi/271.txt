   The persecution of Christians  has increased since new restrictions on freedoms were enforced in February of this year and is the worst since the reign of dictator Mao, they claim.Since the restriction, there have been increased reports of the government’s campaign of repression, including churches being forced to tear down crosses and replace them with the China  national flag.Brynne Lawrence from the Human Rights Organisation, ChinaAid, said to Express.co.uk the Chinese government’s desire to control the churches comes from “an unfounded founded paranoia that foreign powers are using religion to infiltrate China and overthrow their rule”.According to the human rights activist, China needs people to first be loyal to the government and its beliefs and place their religion second.
