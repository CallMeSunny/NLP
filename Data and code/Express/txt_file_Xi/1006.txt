    China has announced plans to ban the use of VPNs across the country.VPNs are widely used in China to navigate around the government’s strict online blocks that prevent residents accessing a number of major western websites.Sites on the countries blocked list include Facebook, Twitter, YouTube – and even Google.Announcing the new rules, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology described the new rules as a “clean-up” of the countries internet connections.But those caught using a VPN to access western websites will not be punished just yet.  GETTYNetflix has a much larger catalogue of TV shows and films in the United StatesChina has confirmed that the nationwide VPN block won’t come into effect until March 31 2018.When implemented, the punishment for flouting these laws is unclear as China has remained intentionally vague on the consequences.China is renowned for its strict internet censorship.However not all members of the Chinese hierarchy believe that controlling the county’s internet access is the best move.

    Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic of China and General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, suggested net censorship was shortsighted.He said: "We must redouble efforts to develop global connectivity to enable all countries to achieve inter-connected growth and share prosperity."Pursuing protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room."While wind and rain may be kept outside, that dark room will also black light and air."And China isn't the only one cracking down on VPN usage.Last year, Netflix began a move to block users who used VPNs to view content outside of their permitted region."Some members use proxies or “unblockers” to access titles available outside their territory," continued the blog post."To address this, we employ the same or similar measures other firms do. This technology continues to evolve and we are evolving with it.
