     We really have no choice but to increase pressure on North Korea, diplomatically isolate themMatt Pottinger, senior Asian affairs director at the National Security CouncilMr Pottinger said: “They have made no secret in conversations they've had with former American officials, for example, and others that they want to use these weapons as an instrument of blackmail to achieve other goals, even including perhaps the coercive reunification of the Korean peninsula one day, after they then attempt to coerce the US to leave the peninsula and to abandon our alliances."It's also no secret that North Korea has proliferated just about every weapons system that they've ever created.“We really have no choice but to increase pressure on North Korea, diplomatically isolate them, to bring greater economic pain to bear until they are willing to make concrete steps to start reducing that threat.”His comments come after an anonymous North Korean defector revealed Mr Kim’s plans to become “King of Korea”.The defector reportedly said: “History has proved that the North Korea state will never give up its nuclear capability and their final goal is the unification of Korea on their own terms."   Outlining President Trump’s stance on North Korea, Mr Pottinger insisted that the White House does not want to “seek regime change”.Instead, he said the US aims to “achieve denuclearisation of the peninsula” which is the goal China shares with them.  GETTYKim Jong-un wants to become the 'King of Korea' after he reunifies the divided regionThe US President has been full of praise and compliments towards his Chinese leader Xi Jinping amid their joint plans to defuse Kim's nuclear threat.After their first meeting last month, Mr Trump hailed Mr Xi as a “gentleman” who "wants to do the right thing".
