   Nuclear envoys for the two countries had a conversation today where they “discussed recent developments on the Korean Peninsula” including the proposed denuclearisation.Lee Do-hoon, special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs spoke with Kenji Kanasugi, director-general of Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asian and Oceanian affairs bureau, according to the Seoul Foreign Ministry. While relations between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in have thawed since their historic summit last year, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is yet to meet Kim despite declaring he wanted to “break the shell of mutual distrust”.
