   In a speech on Monday, Xu Xiaohong told the Chinese parliament’s largely ceremonial advisory body Christians needed to follow what he called a Chinese model of the religion. He said there were many problems with Christianity in the country, including “infiltration” from abroad and “private meeting places”. He added: “It must be recognised that our movement’s surname is ‘China’ and not ‘Western’. “Anti-China forces in the West are trying to continue to influence China’s social stability and even subvert our country’s political power through Christianity, and it is doomed to fail.
