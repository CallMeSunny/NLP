   The Italian populist government is set to sign a memorandum of understanding with China on its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as the country’s president Xi Jinping’s visits Rome later this month. The BRI, also known as Silk Road Economic Belt, is a development plan adopted by the Chinese government to tighten cooperation with foreign countries. The decision has upset both the US, currently entwined in difficult negotiations with Beijing to end their bitter trade war, and the EU, which is concerned about the amount of access state-backed companies in China are gaining into European technologies and infrastructure.  Related articles   Beijing BANS Canadian imports as diplomatic spat INTENSIFIES   EU to launch bid to please countries furious over anti-China stance But Italy, which has been increasingly stepping out of the line dictated by the EU more than once since its eurosceptic coalition sworn in on June 1 last year, hopes an endorsement to the BRI will make Rome a “more attractive and easier” market for investors in Beijing, according to analysts.Agatha Kratz, at consultancy company Rhodium Group, said: “Italian leaders hope that the memorandum will increase the visibility of Italy as an investment destination, making it more attractive and easier for Chinese investors to invest under the BRI banner.”Italy’s new relationship with China within the BRI’s frame is considered unusual by experts.   Italy is to become the first G7 country to endorse China's globalisation strategy (Image: GETTY)Until now, the BRI has seen Beijing collaborating with less developed nations than Italy, according to Jonathan Hillman, director of the Reconnecting Asia Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.He said: “Italy is an unusual candidate for China’s BRI, economically and politically.“As a member of the G7, it would be the largest economy to endorse the BRI. “It may be looking to position itself as an alternative to the EU’s larger economies, where scrutiny of Chinese investments has been increasing.”   Related articles   China warns of PROFOUND change as US trade war slows economic growth    EU has ‘overestimated Russia and UNDERESTIMATED China’s sway over EU   Xi Jinping and Donald Trump's negotiating teams are trying to put an end to their trade war (Image: GETTY)  Rome has been in open defiance with many of the EU's positions in the past year (Image: GETTY)Launched in 2013, the BRI has seen more than 2,200 deals announced, but not all of them have gone ahead.Rome’s decision to try to attract Chinese assets comes after the Chinese foreign direct investment in Europe fell by 40 percent in 2018 and more than 50 percent in 2017, marking the lowest level in four years, as shown in a survey by Germany’s Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) and the New York research firm Rhodium Group (RHG).The plunge has been caused both by tightened investment rules for Chinese state firms, introduced in a bid to prevent capitals moving out of the country, and European fears China is gaining too much access into sensitive information via state-backed companies such as tech giant Huawei.The researchers said in their study: “This decline is very much in line with a further drop in China’s global outbound FDI, a trend that can be attributed to continued capital controls and tightening of liquidity in China as well as growing regulatory scrutiny in host economies.”
