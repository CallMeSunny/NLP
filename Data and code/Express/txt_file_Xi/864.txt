    Threats from the EU have not stopped Theresa May, who boosted Britain's global trading links further yesterday when she met Chinese President Xi Jinping. Mrs May and President Xi agreed relations between Britain and China were going through “a golden era”. A source said: “The Chinese President said that he believed the talks between Britain and the EU had got off to a positive start.“Since the referendum, Chinese investment in the UK had increased which showed Chinese confidence in the UK.” President Xi told Mrs May that “Brexit was a very big event for the world”. But he went on to say that a stable and prosperous UK and EU were good for the world.
