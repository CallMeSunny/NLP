   As the UK and EU continue a negotiation stalemate over Brexit, political observers have noted how China has swooped in and manoeuvred the crisis to its own benefit. The country's President XI Jinping was this week wooed by European leaders hoping to line up China for new economic deals ahead of a EU-China summit on April 9. Mr Xi was invited to meet with Jean-Claude Juncker, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel in Paris in order to strengthen diplomatic ties. His trip comes on the back of a recent European Commission announcement saying it wanted greater cooperation with the nation.
