    On North Korea, Mr Kerry said Washington wanted new UN Security Council action that would impose "significant new measures" to punish Kim Jong-un's regime for its testÂ this month and boost pressure on the North to return to disarmament talks.He said: "There's been a lot of talk about North Korea through these past years. Now we believe is the time for action that can bring North Korea back to the table."But Mr Wang said China, which is Pyongyang's most important ally, would not support new penalties even though it condemned the testing, adding: "Sanctions are not an end in themselves."
