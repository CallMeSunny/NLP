    FOLLOW LIVE PARIS AGREEMENT UPDATE HEREWhat is the Paris climate agreement?The Paris Agreement is a historic global pact to cut greenhouse gases and reduce emissions in the fight against climate change.The deal was signed by the leaders of about 200 nations and was the first legally-binding agreement to tackle climate change on a global scale. The accord came into effect in November 2016 and was hailed as a “historic” step forward in reducing our carbon footprint.  GETTYBarack Obama ratified the Paris Agreement with Chinese President Xi JinpingWhat is the aim of the Paris deal?The primary goals of the Paris Agreement are:To hold global temperatures “well below” 2C above pre-industrial times - with the intention of reducing this further to 1.5C.To cut greenhouses gasses emitted by humans to sustainable levels inline with the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by plants, trees and oceans. Wealthy countries should assist poorer nations by providing a “climate finance” to help them make the shift to renewable energy sources. Each country’s contribution to cutting emissions will be reviewed and assessed every five years.   The United States and China ratified the Paris climate agreement together in September 2016. Former President of the United States Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping submitted their plan to join the agreement at the same time to encourage other nations to follow their lead. Senior Obama advisor Brian Deese said at the time: The signal of the two large emitters taking this step together and taking it early, far earlier than people had anticipated a year ago, should give confidence to the global communities and to other countries that are working on their climate change plans, that they too can move quickly and will be part of a global effort.”
