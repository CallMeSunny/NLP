  GETTYDalai Lama shuns Donald Trump meeting after president befriends Chinese leader Xi JinpingThe United States has long recognised Tibet as part of the People's Republic of China, and does not back Tibetan independence. But that has not deterred all the recent US presidents before President Trump from meeting the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. The United States is widely seen as the last major Western power that has still held meetings with the Dalai Lama despite Beijing's objections that such encounters foment separatism. In past meetings, the US had consistently voiced support for the protection of human rights of Tibetans in China, and called for formal talks between Beijing and the Dalai Lama and his representatives.   GETTYThe two leaders have formed an unlikely friendship Related articles   Saudi Arabia to lead fight against extremism following Trump visit   Donald Trump hails meeting with Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull  His Holiness was supposed to go (to the US) in April, but it was postponedLobsang SangayThe Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request asking whether Beijing had asked President Trump not to meet the Dalai Lama. “His Holiness was supposed to go (to the US) in April, but it was postponed,” Lobsang Sangay, head of the Tibetan government-in-exile, said. That trip has been delayed until June due to a hectic schedule in the preceding months that had left the Dalai Lama physically exhausted, Sangay said, adding that Washington D.C. wouldn't be part of the June itinerary. The office of the Dalai Lama hasn't reached out to Trump to arrange a meeting yet, he said.    The Dalai Lama is taking a more considered approach with regard to any meeting with Trump, said a source with knowledge of the thinking of the winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize. The unpredictable US president upset protocol in December when weeks before being sworn into office he took a telephone call from the leader of self-ruled Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province, only to last week rebuff Taiwanese suggestions of another call. In the interim, President Trump has met and phoned President Xi, and says he has built a strong relationship with the Chinese leader.  First 100 days of President Trump Mon, June 12, 2017President Donald Trump is making a significant impact on global politics during his first term.

    He called President Xi “a friend of mine” who was “doing an amazing job as a leader” in an interview last week, and praised him for trying to rein in nuclear-armed North Korea. In return, the Chinese president has invited President Trump to visit China this year. In mid-2008, then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown met the Dalai Lama, to the anger of Beijing. Months later, David Miliband, the Foreign Secretary at the time, ditched Britain's near century-long position on Tibet, describing it as an “anachronism”, and explicitly recognised Tibet as part of China. Based on treaties signed at the turn of the 20th century by British-administered India and Tibet, Britain had previously said it would recognise China's “special position” in Tibet on the condition that Tibet was given significant autonomy.
