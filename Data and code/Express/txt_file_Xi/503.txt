   Three local governments in northeastern China have sent home hundreds of South Korean religious people operating there since late last year and taken measures to have their churches closed.The authorities in the three provinces - Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang - had hundreds out of around 1,000 South Korean pastors and missionaries living there leave China, since late last year.All South Korean churches in Changchun, the capital of Jilin Province, were closed as of early this month.The Chinese authorities have offered no clear reasons for the measures taken against South Korean religious people and churches.
