   The UK voted to leave the bureaucratic European trade bloc in 2016 in part to be able to trade more freely with countries around the world after Brussels officials imposed tariffs on products being imported from outside Europe, limiting choice for consumers in Britain.However, it has been revealed that in some sectors China has found a way of producing goods at such a cheap rate they are able to compete with EU producers in spite of the high tariffs.Informa’s Agribusiness Intelligence has revealed that in apple juice production, China is able to sell their product at a rate that will allow UK consumers to have a greater choice of where they buy their morning fruit juice.

    Last week Jacob Rees-Mogg told Express.co.uk Britons’ living standards will soar after Brexit thanks to the removal or reduction of EU tariffs.He said the UK will not have to be restricted by punitive food, wine, clothing and footwear costs.The North East Somerset MP said: “What Brexit should be about is ensuring the standards of living of the readers of the Daily Express et cetera, are high.“How do we achieve that? We achieve that by shoring up our economy by allowing them to buy high-quality food that is cheaper from other countries.“So, to buy oranges from Florida, rather than oranges from Spain - that could potentially reduce people’s food costs by 20 per cent.”   Informa’s Agribusiness Intelligence said an increase in Chinese production was bad news to EU producers as it would leave countries like the UK would be less likely to buy their products from European producers.They added: “This is bad news for Polish producers where a moderate harvest and more apple brokers and farmers locking up fruit in cold store have led to a decline in the amount of apple juice concentrate produced this year.”The UK has already signed an agreement with China that will allow them to improve trade with the nation without paying the expensive tariffs put in place by the EU27.Theresa May visited President Xi Jinping last week and signed a bumper trade deal with Beijing worth millions in massive Brexit boost.
