   The Pew Research Centre poll of 25 countries found just 27 percent of respondents had confidence in President Trump to "do the right thing regarding world affairs”.In contrast, 52 percent said they had confidence in German Chancellor Angela Merkel to "do the right thing" in global affairs followed by French President Emmanuel Macron on 46 percent and China’s Mr Xi at 34 percent.Even Mr Putin, whose country stands accused of the Salisbury poisoning scandal, interfering with foreign elections and ongoing human rights abuses, was deemed more trustworthy than Mr Trump with 30 percent.The non-partisan, Washington-based think tank Pew surveyed 26,112 people in 25 countries from mid-May to mid-August.
