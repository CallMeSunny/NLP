    Speaking on Friday, China confirmed they would be arranging tariffs, but said they wanted to avoid a trade war.The Commerce Ministry said: “China does not want a trade war.“We will immediately launch tariff measures that will match the scale and intensity of those launched by the United States.“All economic and trade agreements reached by previous negotiations will be nullified at the same time.”China is currently the world’s biggest buyer of US oil.   They import an estimated 363,000 barrels of American crude oil every day.They also take in about 200,000 barrels of other petroleum products each day including propane.The US has been encouraging countries to buy oil for them, rather than Iran, and is currently exporting a record two million barrels of crude every single day.China is also the world’s largest importer of Iranian oil.In the first quarter of 2018, they were purchasing around 650,000 barrels each day from the country.
