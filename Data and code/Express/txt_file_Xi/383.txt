  GETTYGold prices have jumped amid fears of a crashBritain's top stock market the FTSE 100 fell by around 0.5 per cent on Thursday after losses in Asia and on Wall Street overnight. At the same time, gold values have pushed higher to sit at $1,254 (£1,003) - now up from around $1,200 (£960) just one month ago. The precious metal is traditionally a safe haven for cash in times of market turmoil and downturns. Experts have predicted prices could now hit $1,300 (£1,040) if fear continues to rise over sky-high stocks.

    Now all eyes are on what is set to be a strained meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Xi. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index Direct, said: "The Fed engaged in a detailed discussion about how to shrink its $4.4trillion balance sheet at its meeting last month, and also pointed out the high valuations of US stock markets. "This has led to a risk-off tone as we approach 48 hours full of key event risks."Markets will be looking for any tension between President Trump and China’s President Xi, any sign of discord could be enough to trigger significant declines in global risk assets."
