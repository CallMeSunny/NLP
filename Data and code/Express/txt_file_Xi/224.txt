    US General Michael Hayden recently remarked that North Korea could face increasing pressure to put an end to their nuclear test thanks to Donald Trump's visit to key allies in Asia.He claimed: "You've got a bit of a ray of light, a breath of fresh air here with the Chinese trying to amp up their pressure on the North Koreans."But you have to be realistic: China is most interested in stability on the whole Korean peninsula. They’re not too excited about change."   Speaking to CNN, General Hayden said China – North Korea's only ally in the region – is now expected to exercise more influence on Pyongyang.The retired general continued: "I think we can rely on them to amp up the pressure a bit to have Kim the youngest tone down the rhetoric, maybe stop testing for a while."But I don’t think he’s going there to point out that they need to give up these weapons."
