Mr Pyne said the “might is right” approach to diplomacy adopted by Russia is not the way to behave as one of the world’s superpowers, adding no country wants to stifle China’s growth and prosperity. He was talking at the 2019 Fullerton Forum, a meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders focusing on achieving military diplomacy in the region.
