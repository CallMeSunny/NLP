  US-China relations: Trump's administration has accused China of espionage (Image: GETTY)The explosive claim was made in a report submitted on Wednesday to the Senate Intelligence Committee. More than two thirds of the Department’s theft of trade secrets “have had a nexus to China”, the report stated. It came amid heightened scrutiny of China’s cyber capabilities after a Marriott Hotels cyber attack was reportedly linked to the superpower.
