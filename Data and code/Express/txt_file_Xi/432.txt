    Highlighting the legitimacy of their trade relationship, Huang Songping, a Beijing customs spokesman said the exports were largely driven by textile products and other traditional labour-intensive goods that are not included on the United Nations embargo list.Noticing their strengthening trade relations last week, Mr Trump tweeted: “Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40 per cent in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!”President Trump has been putting enormous pressure on his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to take action against Kim Jong-un.Diplomats told Reuters that Beijing has not been fully enforcing existing international sanctions on its neighbour.In a bid to reign in Kim Jong-un, the US has also proposed tougher sanctions on North Korea following their provocative ICBM test launch earlier this month.Yesterday tensions flared as China’s foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said it was not his country’s responsibility to deal with the communist state.Speaking at a press conference, Mr Geng said: “Recently, certain people, talking about the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, have been exaggerating and giving prominence to the so-called 'China responsibility theory’.“I think this either shows lack of a full, correct knowledge of the issue, or there are ulterior motives for it, trying to shift responsibility.”However Chinese officials have previously expressed their disdain for North Korea’s provocative actions.
