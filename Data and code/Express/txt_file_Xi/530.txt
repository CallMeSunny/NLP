  GETTYLib Dem peers have threatened to block the Government’s attempts to cut tax creditsLib Dem peers are plotting to try to wreck his proposed cuts to tax credits, one of his key Budget measures, in a crunch House of Lords vote. The Chancellor must have thought that the days when the pesky minor party could rip up his financial plans were behind him. Like every Tory he assumed the general election humiliation for Nick Clegg and his chums meant an end to the petulant blockading and sabotage that had dogged the coalition years.On Monday night the yellow curse is threatening to strike again. Lib Dem Baroness Manzoor has tabled a “fatal motion” drafted to kill Mr Osborne’s attempt to slash around £4.4billion from the bloated annual welfare budget. Tory MPs are furious at the latest threat of mischief by their unloved former coalition partners. New Lib Dem leader Tim Farron may have been left with just eight MPs following the party’s poll drubbing yet can still command a force of 110 peers in the Lords.Related articles   China leader Xi Jinping tells UK to stay in the EU Opponents of the tax credit cuts have enough strength in the Lords to outvote the Government. Labour peers too have laid amendments designed to force ministers into a rethink. Yet it is the Lib Dem motion that poses the greatest threat to the Chancellor’s plans. Tories see the Lib Dem reliance on unelected peers as ridiculous. It was Mr Farron’s Liberal Party forebears just over a century ago that fought so hard to reduce the Lords’ power to block financial measures.Parliamentary warfare between the two chambers over Liberal chancellor David Lloyd George’s 1909 “People’s Budget”, promising increased taxes on income and land to fund a new old-age pension, triggered a constitutional crisis. It ended with the confirmation of the supremacy of the elected house over the nobility. Mr Farron, though, knows that today’s Liberals are a forgotten rump in danger of extinction.  GETTYLib Dem peers are plotting to try to wreck Osborne's proposed cuts to tax creditsHe is determined to seize any opportunity to grab some attention even if it means resorting to parliamentary stunts in the chamber that his party claims to despise. Many Tory MPs have misgivings about the impact of tax credit cuts on the low paid but are adamant that the Lords must not be allowed to thwart the will of the Commons on a crucial element of the Government’s programme. For the Lords to overturn a financial measure that could cost taxpayers billions of pounds would be a serious step to takeA Downing Street sourceFears of another constitutional rupture are growing. “For the Lords to overturn a financial measure that could cost taxpayers billions of pounds would be a serious step to take. They need to tread very carefully,” said one Downing Street source. “The Government has a clear mandate to push ahead with welfare reforms. It is a serious moment.” In the Commons this week senior Tory backbencher Sir Edward Leigh said: “Surely it is the elected representatives of the people who decide on tax and spending.”Downing Street officials are playing down suggestions that David Cameron could ennoble dozens of new Tory peers to try to increase his grip on the upper house. A new push by the Prime Minister to further reduce the power of the Lords is more likely. David Cameron has never been interested in reform of the House of Lords, an arcane subject that has sapped the energy of many governments over the last century.

    He has enough constitutional battles to fight with his plans for a new British Bill of Rights to replace Labour’s Human Rights Act and for trimming the power of Scottish MPs to vote on issues only affecting England But defeat in the Lords on Monday would deal a serious blow to the Government’s timetable for wiping out the country’s deficit. Even a delay in introducing tax credit cuts could cost the Treasury billions of pounds.Mr Cameron is an instinctively cautious politician who has frequently been forced into taking radical measures by circumstance. His Government’s public spending cuts and his decision to hold an in-or-out EU referendum were both thrust upon him against his will. Now high jinks in the House of Lords by the Lib Dems and their allies could force the reluctant radical into action again.  GETTYDavid Cameron has never been interested in reform of the House of Lords--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kowtowing to china has angered mpsCHINESE President Xi Jinping’s speech to MPs and peers was not a hit with everyone in his audience at Parliament’s Royal Gallery this week. Dropping into Westminster as part of the tour itinerary in his state visit the uncharismatic communist bureaucrat delivered a lecture about how the “rule of law” in his country dated back 4,000 years. Britain’s parliamentary system stretched only to the 13th century, he pointed out.And he insisted that the People’s Republic of China would follow its own path and rejected calls for the spread of democracy and human rights. It was a message that contrasted with those delivered by many visiting leaders granted the prestigious honour of addressing both Houses of Parliament in the past. Most have been statesmen and women from countries allied to the UK celebrating shared democratic traditions. The first foreign leader given the privilege at Westminster was French president Albert Lebrun in 1939 at a time when Britain and France stood together in the face of a growing Nazi menace. General Charles de Gaulle, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama and three US presidents are among the democratic leaders and freedom campaigners who have followed him over the years. Some MPs felt giving the Chinese president the rare honour was inappropriate given his repressive rule.His regime frequently harasses, imprisons and tortures political dissidents and their families and persecutes followers of religions not controlled by the state. One Tory MP told me: “We can do business with China without having to kowtow in this way.” Commons Speaker John Bercow spoke for many in the audience with a barbed introduction during which he recalled a speech at Westminster by Burma’s “champion of democracy” Aung San Suu Kyi.  GETYChinese President Xi Jinping is on a State Visit in the UKOnce rare events, addresses to both Houses of Parliament have become an almost routine part of the hospitality offered to visiting foreign leaders, be they democrats or dictators. Five years ago David Cameron declared that the Foreign Office’s primary role should be promoting British business overseas. MPs now fear that the Government has press-ganged Parliament into doing the same job.Related articles   Blame the green agenda for steel industry's woes says Leo McKinstry  Chinese president's wife's make-up mishap as husband also fails to impress at banquet  'I’m not leaving my family' Cameron jokes with Chinese PM at pub where he forgot daughter  China leader Xi Jinping tells UK to stay in the EU
