    China appeared to be trying to hide their presence by hiding military vehicles and tents under camouflage nets.In August talks were held to defuse the mounting crisis over the region and it was agreed that military personnel would leave the area.But although Indian troops left the Doklam region, China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at the time that Chinese troops would continue to patrol the area.   She said: “China will continue to exercise sovereignty rights to protect territorial sovereignty in accordance with the rules of the historical boundary.”The Chinese defence ministry added that troops would remain on a state of alert.She said: “We remind the Indian side to learn the lesson from this incident, earnestly respect the historical boundary and the basic principles of international law, meet China half way and jointly protect the peace and tranquillity of the border region.  GETTYChina have began to increase their military presence on the border  GETTYIndia's Prime Minister Modi's troops withdrew from the region in August“The world is not peaceful, and peace needs to be safeguarded. The Chinese military has the confidence and the ability to protect the country's sovereignty, security and development interests.”China’s decision to increase their military presence in the area could lead to India once again sending their army to the region.Tensions over Doklam have raged since the 1960s when a dispute over the border between China and Bhutan broke out.
