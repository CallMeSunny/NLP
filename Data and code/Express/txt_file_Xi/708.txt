  GETTYChina have renewed military drills in the South China SeaThe Communist nation has held another round of drills in the disputed South China Sea and the Western Pacific after passing by Japan's southern islands, the air force said on Sunday, calling such exercises the best preparation for war.China is in the midst of an ambitious military modernisation programme overseen by President Xi Jinping with a heavy focus on its air force and navy, from building stealth fighters to adding aircraft carriers.President Xi insists his nation has no hostile intent, but its sabre-rattling in the busy South China Sea waterway, and around Taiwan, has touched a nerve in the region and in Washington.In a statement, the air force said H-6K bombers and Su-30 and Su-35 fighters, among other aircraft, carried out combat patrols over the South China Sea and exercises in the Western Pacific after passing over the Miyako Strait, which lies between two southern Japanese islands.

Mr Wong became the first senior State Department official to visit Taiwan since Mr Trump came into power, and since Washington approved the Taiwan Travel Act, which has already worsened ties and brought new pressures to US-China relations.Mr Wong said in Taipei on Wednesday that the United States’ commitment to Taiwan has never been stronger and that the island is an inspiration to the remaining regions of the Indo-Pacific.China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own and considers it a wayward province.And Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that Taiwan would face the “punishment of history” if it were to make any attempts to separate.The Global Times said in an editorial that China had to “strike back against the law.

This can be implemented gradually depending on the cross-Straits situation.”
