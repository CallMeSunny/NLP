  CHINA has announced a major military development, disclosing its new-generation stealth bombers (Image: Getty)According to Asia Times, Beijing wants the strategic H-20 to be able to fly close to the US west coast and fire conventional or nuclear cruise missiles against US targets.On Wednesday, Chinese state television disclosed the name of the military aircraft and announced the imminent trial flight without, however, specifying the date.The design of the H-20 mirrors the US Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber.Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times: “The new generation of bombers can carry more bombs than the H-6K bombers, has the advantage of stealth features, and is able to strike targets from standoff ranges.” Related articles   Dow Jones PLUNGES 836 points: US markets in CHAOS    World War 3: China 'fighting tomorrow's fight' warns FBI China did not previously have an operational, strategic bomber able to strike targets from a long distance.The H-20's specifications include a range of 8,000 kilometres without having to stop for refuelling and a compartment which can carry more than 10 tons of munitions, including thermonuclear weapons.However, experts claim the US west coast may be too far to reach for the bomber, and it would require at least one refuelling above the Pacific.Nevertheless, the H-20 would still be able to bomb US overseas territories such as Sapian, Guam and the Hawaii.
