   With the Speaker meant to remain impartial and independent, Conservative MPs have called for him to stand down amid the storm of criticism, after he moved to bar Trump from addressing the house. Alec Shelbrooke claimed that Mr Bercow’s position was now “untenable” as he launched an angry tirade against the the former Tory MP.Speaking on BBC Daily Politics, the MP for Elmet and Rothwell described the speech as “inconsistent” and urged the Speaker to resign from his role.“He is not acting independently,” he blasted. “The very fact that we are having this conversation today, on a political issue brought about by the Speaker, shows that he is no longer able to independently chair and have support and respect across the whole of the House of Commons.  BBCTory MP Alec Shelbrooke called for John Bercow to stand down as Speaker He is no longer able to independently chair and have the support of the whole of the House of CommonsAlec Shelbrooke“It’s unfortunate but I think his position is untenable.”Mr Shelbrooke also accused Mr Bercow of hypocrisy, after previously welcoming other world leaders, who have been questioned for their human rights records.He has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping despite MPs being unhappy over his policy on Tibet and the Emir of Kuwait, which bans British dual nationals of Israeli origins, to speak in Parliament.The Conservative MP continued: “Let me say right at the start I don’t support some of the policies of Donald Trump and I certainly feel that his attitude, in some of the things recorded, to women are unacceptable.   “There are many world leaders, who I find their politics to be unacceptable. As I understand it an invitation hasn’t even been requested to speak in Westminster Hall. “It’s a bit of a hypothetical argument and it’s one, [which] at this stage, is slightly unnecessary. “What I don’t quite understand is that the Speaker said it was an honour to introduce the Emir of Kuwait – a country that jails people for seven years for being gay, represses women and bans Israelis from entering.“I would have thought the comments of, ‘I’m against racism and sexism,’ would fit that as well. I wonder why there isn’t a consistency to the policies.” The UK Protests Against President Trump Tue, February 21, 2017President Trump signed an executive order banning immigration to the USA from seven 'muslim' countries.

    However, other Conservatives have not been so keen to speculate on the future of Mr Bercow in the role of Speaker of the House.Speaking on Sky News, Sajid Javid refused to be drawn into a debut on whether the Mr Bercow should relinquish his role after the controversy.The Communities Secretary having been asked if the Speaker had overstepped the marker, he responded: “Anyone who knows the Speaker knows that he’s perfectly capable of speaking his own mind.”He added: “What’s important is that we have full respect for the office of the President of the United States and whoever sits in that office at any time.”
