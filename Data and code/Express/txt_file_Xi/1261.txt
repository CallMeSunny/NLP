  EPA/ AFPThe Vatican has issued a warning to Catholics in ChinaCatholics in the secretive state are divided between the official state Church, which heavily monitors sermons and teachings, and those who attend ‘underground Churches’, which run illegally away from the eyes of Xi Jinping’s Communist government.It has led to an underground movement where leaders are unofficially elected without authorisation from the Chinese Communist Party, with reports of bishops also being appointed without the approval of the Vatican. The Pope had previously declined to intervene, recognising persecuted Christians’ struggles.  Related articles   Church pastor tortured and threatened with DEATH   China's horrifying religious oppression ‘most tyrannical’ in 40 years  The Holy See has not authorised any ordinationThe Holy SeeBut the Vatican today hit out amid growing expectation the Vatican and the Chinese government are close to an agreement on the ordination of bishops, the stickiest point in talks between the two sides.The Vatican and China are engaged in formal dialogue but despite the church’s efforts to compromise on the selection of bishops, China still insists it has the authority to appoint bishops independent of the Holy See.The statement said: “In recent weeks, there has been a series of reports regarding some episcopal ordinations conferred without Papal Mandate of priests of the unofficial community of the Catholic Church in Continental China.   “The Holy See has not authorised any ordination, nor has it been officially informed of such events. Should such episcopal ordinations have occurred, they would constitute a grave violation of canonical norms.“The Holy See hopes that such reports are baseless. If not, it will have to await reliable information and sure documentation before adequately evaluating the cases. “However, it is reiterated that it is not licit to proceed with any episcopal ordination without the necessary Papal Mandate, even by appealing to particular personal beliefs.”The statement could be seen as a warning to underground Catholics not to take matters into their own hands, and instead wait for the Vatican to make a formal agreement.  REUTERSThe Vatican and China are engaged in formal dialogue over ordained bishopsThe Vatican has often condemned the official, government-backed Church for ordaining bishops without papal permission but has never before issued a similar warning to the faction loyal to the Pope.China's foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he was unaware of this specific statement but said China and the Vatican had unimpeded and effective channels of communication. China was willing to work with the Vatican to improve relations, he added.But the impending deal to ease Beijing’s tightened grip on worship has sparked strong criticism from some Catholics in China and around the world who believe it would be an offence to Catholic bishops, priests and lay people who have suffered persecution for refusing to join the official, state Church.

    In what appeared to be a reference to Catholics opposed to any deal with the government, the Vatican statement said the ordination of bishops needed papal permission and could not be based on "particular personal beliefs".For more than six decades, China's ruling Communist Party has strongly opposed the Vatican's right to ordain Chinese bishops, in a bitter contest for authority over as many as 10 million Catholics on the mainland.According to Church sources in Rome and China, representatives from the Vatican and China are expected to meet before the end of the year in Rome in an effort to finalise a deal on the ordination of bishops.
