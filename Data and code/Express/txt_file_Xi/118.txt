    Mr Petras said: “Washington’s strategy is designed to contain and influence China if possible, and in extreme basis for launching a nuclear attack on China.“I think the pretext of attacking North Korea is simply an excuse to build up US military capabilities for a nuclear attack.”Dane Chamorro, senior partner and head of ASEAN (Asian) at Control Risks, told CNBC the former business tycoon has been indirectly hostile to President Xi.Although the 70-year-old has been full of praise for his Chinese counterpart, Mr Chamorro said the US President wanted to scare Beijing when he launched 59 Tomahawk missiles to attack Syria.The expert said President Trump wanted to indirectly tell President Xi: “There’s a new sheriff in town, I’m a little unpredictable and bad things will happen, things that you don’t like unless you get Kim 3.0 under control.”  GETTYMelania Trump bonding with Jinping's wife Peng LiyuanReferring to President Xi, in front of Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Mr Trump said last month: “I do not know Putin but I do know this gentleman.”He added: “I’ve spent a lot of time with him over the last two days and he is the President of China. You were there, most of you were there and it was quite an interesting period of time.“President Xi wants to do the right thing. We had a very good bonding, I think we had very good chemistry together.”
