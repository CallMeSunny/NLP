  China has felt the brunt of an ongoing trade war with the US (Image: GETTY)Last week saw the Chinese tender end trading at its weakest close against the US dollar since January 2017 as fears of a slowdown in economic growth and an escalating trade war keep a tight grip on Asian markets.The yuan is currently trading at around 6.94 against the US dollar, but Timothy Moe, co-head of Asia macro research, predicted this number could creep over 7 per dollar in the next half year.He told CNBC: “It’s probably unlikely to happen before the end of the year because... 7 seems to be the short-term line in the sand.”China stocks also plunged to an almost four-year low on Friday, before rebounding to record its best day in more than two and a half years on Monday.

The economy grew 6.7 percent year-over-year in the first nine months of 2018, according to official statistics.China has been bearing the brunt of an escalating trade war between Beijing and the US, further being heightened by policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve.Washington has so far slapped $250bllion (£190.4billion) of tariffs on Chinese products.This saw China retaliate with 10 percent tariffs on $60 billion (£46 billion) of US imports.The tariffs stem from the Trump administration's demands that China make sweeping changes to its intellectual property practices.The US also wants Beijing to rein in high-technology industrial subsidies, open its markets to more foreign competition and take steps to cut a $375 billion (£283 billion) US goods trade surplus.
