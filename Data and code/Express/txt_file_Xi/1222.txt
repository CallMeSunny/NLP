  Two US warships have sailed through the Taiwan Strait (Image: USNavy)The voyage risks further heightening tensions with China, which considers Taiwan its own and has not ruled out the use of force to bring the self-ruled island under its control. Taiwan's defence ministry said in a statement late on Thursday the ships were moving in a northerly direction and their voyage was in accordance with regulations. It said Taiwan closely monitored the operation to "ensure the security of the seas and regional stability".

It has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years.

In response, Tsai vowed to defend the island's democracy and called for international support to protect Taiwan's way of life.Mr Trump recently signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act reaffirming the US commitment to Taiwan, including arms sales.
