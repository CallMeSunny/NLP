The former Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee explained to radio host Andrew Castle: “I just don't think it's very dignified for the Mayor of London to behave in such an immature way. State visits are not about saying how pleased we are with a particular individual, my views of Donald Trump are probably very similar to Sadiq Khan's.
