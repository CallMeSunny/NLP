     President Trump is a real enigma because he is rather unpredictableAndrew ScobellAndrew Scobell, an expert on China at the Rand Corporation, told the FT: “When they are making decisions about policy they are always very interested in how the US will respond.“They want a predictable response, whether it is good or bad, they just want predictable.“In that sense, President Trump is a real enigma, because he is rather unpredictable.”Many of China’s “Americanologists” hold doctorates from top US universities, and their speciality is one of the best-funded of the social sciences in China. Mr Scobell said: “You’ll often find someone who has one set of views in a one-on-one chat sounds very different when they are writing a column in a Chinese newspaper. They will be much more hawkish.“They feel like they have to inoculate themselves from being considered too pro-American.” Related articles   WATCH: Donald Trump squares up to Chinese President in Beijing    China to flatter then IGNORE Trump’s demands for help with North Korea   GETTYDonald Trump visits Beijing's Forbidden City with Xi Jinping and their wivesMr Trump’s election victory 12 months ago stunned most go China’s Americanologists, who failed, along with most US political experts, to predict it.Yanmei Xie of Beijing consultancy Gavekal Dragonomics told the FT: “There was a lot of initial panic in China when Trump was elected, a lot of ‘how do we handle this guy and who do we need to contact to establish communications?’“But China’s management of Trump has been mature. They have a good reading of Washington.”Mr Trump is in China as part of his 12-day tour of Asia an North Korea is high on the agenda.Mr Trump has threatened to unleash “fire and fury” on North Korea and has regularly taken to Twitter to issue threats against Pyongyang.But he appears to have toned down the rhetoric on his Asian tour and yesterday urged Kim Jong-un to engage in talks on his nuclear ambitions.He wants China to stand firm against its reclusive neighbours and observe tough trade sanctions adopted by the UN Security Council in a bid to end the crisis in the region.But Shi Yinhong, a US specialist at Renmin University, said Mr Trump’s tweeting “has boiled the US-China relationship down into one issue that is not solvable: North Korea”.
