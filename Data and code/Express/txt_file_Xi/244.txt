   The threat posed by North Korea was a key topic in phone calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of China and Japan, along with trade issues, the White House said yesterday. Mr Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ahead of expected meetings with the leaders of Asia's two biggest economies at a Group of 20 nations summit in Germany later this week. “Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearised Korean Peninsula,” the White House said of President Trump's call with President Xi from his resort property in Bridgewater, New Jersey, where he is spending a long weekend. NORTH KOREA VS USA - LIVE  GETTYNorth Korea threat the hot topic in discussions between USA and China Related articles   North Korea v US LIVE: Updates now US ‘patience is OVER'    China lashes out at Trump ‘damaging’ anti-missile system  Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearised Korean PeninsulaThe White House“President Trump reiterated his determination to seek more balanced trade relations with America's trading partners,” it added. President Trump has become increasingly frustrated with China's inability to rein in North Korea, and the reference to trade was an indication the one-time New York businessman may be ready to return to his tougher-talking ways on business with Beijing after holding back in hopes it would put more pressure on Pyongyang. China's state media reported that presidents Trump and Xi had discussed the “peace and stability of the Korean peninsula”, the report said, without elaborating. But in separate conversation Mr Trump spoke to South Korean president Moon Jae-in who said the North had one last chance.A spokesman for Mr Moon said: “President Moon said he talked to President Trump about using sanctions and pressure to resolve the North Korean missile and nuclear problem, but also to use dialogue at the same time.“He said it is the last opportunity for North Korea to enter the door of dialogue.”  GETTYMr Trump spoke to Chinese President of Xi Jinping on the threat of North Korea and trade issues VOLCANO: North Korea nuclear weapons could lead to ERUPTION Fri, May 19, 2017A new problem may erupt: when North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, specialists say the energy could trigger a volcanic eruption in Paektu.

    “Negative factors” have affected Sino-US relations, and China has already expressed its position to the United States, President Xi told President Trump, according to a read-out of a telephone call between the leaders carried by state television. China hopes the United States can handle the Taiwan issue appropriately, in accordance with the “one China” principle, President Xi told Donald Trump, the state television report said. On Thursday, the United States targeted a Chinese bank and sanctioned Chinese individuals and a firm for dealing with North Korea and approved a $1.42 billion arms deal with Taiwan – decisions that angered Beijing.
