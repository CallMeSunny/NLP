    Donald Trump has warned Kim Jong-un he will regret forcing the US to take military action against North Korea.The Republican President has refused to rule out a strike against the reclusive state as tensions between Pyongyang and Washington reach boiling point.During a news conference Mr Trump said military action is "an option" against Kim's hermit nation.Although the US President admitted he would "prefer" not to use force against North Korea, he fired an ominous warning to the country's dictator.   He said: "Military action would certainly be an option."Is it inevitable? Nothing is inevitable."I would prefer not going the route of the military."If we do use it on North Korea, it will be a very sad day for North Korea."
