And the biggest of course was China."The President then shockingly claimed the US was responsible for "building China" as he adhered to rally tradition by veering from his teleprompter.The Republican firebrand continued: “China made anywhere from $375billion last year - we built China, and I really like President Xi, but we built China.”President Trump visited Xi Jinping's Asian superstate in November 2017 and declared trade between China and the US had “not been very fair over the last many, many years”.
