How many votes did Xi Jinping get. How many votes? We had a state visit from a Chinese leader ten years after Tiananmen Square. “There have been a lot of other state visits into this country over the years and it’s double standards. It’s simply because people in this room, and maybe in this country as well, cannot understand why it is that the people voted for Donald Trump. Why people voted for Brexit. “Until people in this room understand that then I’m afraid there’s going to be more of the same. The people who feel left behind have spoken and they voted for Donald John Trump.”Tory former minister Sir Edward Leigh insisted that showing "respect and honour" to the new US President was vital for the UK's national interest.Other MPs raised concerns that cancelling the offer could be deeply embarrassing for the Queen.Numerous protests have been taking place across the country - from Brighton to Inverness - organised by the Stop Trump coalition. Mr Trump’s scheduled state visit was extended by Theresa May on behalf of the Queen when she visited Washington DC last month.
