   The rivalry between Washington and Beijing overshadowed a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders over the weekend as the two superpowers used the forum to trade blows over trade policy. Talks at the APEC meeting are aimed at strengthening economic cooperation but came to an acrimonious end on Sunday when leaders were unable to agree on a joint communique for the first time in the group’s 29-year history. At a press conference following the divisive summit, Peter O’Neill, prime minister of host nation Papua New Guinea, signalled the “two big giants in the room” were responsible for the unprecedented end to the event.

Asian nations MUST choose which superstates  And the strained relations between the two nations was laid bare at the APEC summit.Both Washington and Beijing used the event to attack each other's policies and make their case for who is the better investment partner in the Asia-Pacific region.One diplomat involved in negotiations for the communique expressed their surprise over the failure to agree to a statement, which is traditionally an uncontentious summary of what had been discussed.They said: “It's not even supposed to be binding, it's APEC."China and the US hijacked the APEC spirit, I suppose."

China attended to promote cooperation and seek consensus, not to get into a boxing ring.”
