   At the opening ceremony of the One Young World Summit in Bogota, Colombia, Geldof turned his particular attention to State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi over her government's treatment of the Rohingya minority in Burma."On this stage are some of the greatest people who have fought for justice and peace and equality in our world," he said, referring to the Nobel Peace Laureates sitting on stage behind him."And one of their number in Burma insults them – insults them all. Who took the greatest prize that humans can give to another and then becomes one of the great ethnic cleansers of our planet. This is a disgrace."Miss Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, spent a total of 15 years under house arrest when in opposition.
