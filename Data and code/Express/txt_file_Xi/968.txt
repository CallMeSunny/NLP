    But the senior administration official said only a “minority” of US presidents had visited the tense frontier. However, since Ronald Reagan visited in 1983, only George HW Bush has failed to make a visit. President Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on November 8, where the pair will hope to discuss how Beijing is set to tackle the growing threat from the North. A US official added: “The Chinese have done a great deal.      GETTY Barack Obama made a visit when he was US president“They’ve done more than I think many expected they would.
