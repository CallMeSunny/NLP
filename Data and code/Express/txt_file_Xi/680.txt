    The Chinese Communist Party has been accused of cracking down on religious freedom with the laws which restrict worship. Xi Jinping’s despotic regime has banned Christians from praying, singing hymns, removed crosses from buildings and arrested people for attending worship. Christian charities have reported scenes of violence, Christians being arrested, sent to labour camps and tortured. The crackdown has forced Christians underground and has left a deal between the Vatican and China on the brink of collapse.    Catholics in the secretive state are divided between the official state Church, which heavily monitors sermons and teachings, and those who attend ‘underground Churches’, which run illegally away from the eyes of Xi Jinping’s Communist government.It has led to an underground movement where bishops are unofficially elected without authorisation from the Chinese Communist Party or the Vatican. Pope Francis has previously declined to intervene, recognising persecuted Christians’ struggles. But in an unusual move, the Holy See released a statement this week warning underground Catholics not to take matter into their own hands. It comes amid growing expectation the Vatican and the Chinese government are close to an agreement on the ordination of bishops as China still insists it has the authority to appoint bishops independent of the Holy See.
