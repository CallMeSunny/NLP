   North Korea made the chilling threat after a US Navy aircraft carrier was deployed into the Sea of Japan in the show of force from Mr Trump.This morning the US president warned that an “armada” is heading towards North Korea."We are sending an armada. Very powerful," Mr Trump told Fox Business Network. “We have submarines. Very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier. That I can tell you.”Kim Jong-un’s state-owned news agency KCNA quoted the foreign ministry as saying: “We will hold the US wholly accountable for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by its outrageous actions."The DPRK is ready to react to any mode of war desired by the US.”Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged Mr Trump to come to a peaceful resolution as tensions escalate between the two nuclear powers.

It has since conducted five explosions – four at an underground test site in Punggye-ri, and the latest which it claims was a ballistic missile.The first, on October 3, 2006, had an explosive force of less than one kiltonne, leading many to think the bomb “fizzled” rather than detonated properly.North Korea’s next test, in 2009, came amid a succession crisis in the country. The 2.35 kilotonne blast was interpreted by many as a show of strength after leader Kim Jong-il suffered a major stroke. Following the test, the UN passed a resolution banning the country from any further nuclear testing.In 2013, Pyongyang announced it had tested "a miniaturised and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously”, that created an earthquake of magnitude 5.1. It was speculated that the test involved uranium, which would have marked a signifcant leap forward in the North’s nuclear programme, but this was never confirmed.In January 2016, another 5.1 magnitude earthquake was measure in Punggye-ri, which the government announced was the result of a successful hydrogen bomb test.

    On September 9 2016, Pyongang confirmed that it had carried out a “nuclear warhead explosion” in response to “US hostility”.The announcement came after a 5.3 magnitude earthquake was recorded 15 miles north east of Sungjibaegam, just 11 miles below the surface.Experts believe the blast was the largest ever conducted by North Korea, with the explosion measuring 10 kilotonnes. Previously, the biggest blast recorded measured between six and nine kilotonnes.The US has warned of “serious consequence” against North Korea, which is banned by the UN from testing any nuclear or missile technology.Many other world leaders have also condemned the action, with South Korea’s president Park Geun-hye calling the move one of “manical recklessness”.  GETTYKim Jong-un has conducted another nuclear test in North KoreaWhat is a nuclear weapons test? How many have been done and where are they conducted?The US made history on July 16, 1945, when it exploded an atomic device at a desert test site in New Mexico.Since then over 2,000 bombs have been detonated by scientists across the world trying to develop nuclear weapons – explosives made of highly volatile uranium (fission bombs) or hydrogen (thermonuclear bombs).Following its initial test, the US dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki – the first and only nuclear warfare in history. The explosions, which killed over 100,000 people, lead to the end of the Second World War.While nuclear weapons have not been used since, countries including the former Soviet Union, France, China, India, Pakistan and the UK all continued to conduct tests.MAPPED: WORLD'S NUCLEAR POWERS AND UNOFFICIAL THREATS  GETTYScientists have exploded over 2,000 nuclear weaponsThese experiments can be atmospheric, underground, underwater, or in space, and are always conducted well away from populated areas. Most tests, including those conducted by North Korea, have been underground. This method ensures a degree of secrecy until the telltale “venting” of radiation that accompanies blasts.An underground test sees a nuclear device and a lead lined canister containing monitoring equipment placed into a drilled hole or tunnel, usually between 200m and 800m below the Earth’s surface.The tunnel is then filled with gravel to contain the explosion, and the device detonated remotely. The blast is hot enough to melt the surrounding rock, which causes the tunnel to collapse and a crater to appear on the surface.In 1996, 183 nations signed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban treaty, a multilateral agreement that forbade any future testing. India and Pakistan, who did not sign the treaty, have refrained from experiments since 1998. Nuclear bomb tests through the years Mon, January 18, 2016From the early 1900's through to the modern days, countries across the World have been planning and testing their nuclear bombs.

      GETTYKim Jong-un has ordered three tests since becoming leader of North KoreaWill Kim Jong-un spark World War Three?The latest nuclear test has added yet more tension to North Korea’s fraught relationship with the US, and raised fears that World War Three is looming.Recently, a shocking piece of propaganda revealed that children in North Korean schools are being prepared for a “new world war” that would bring “doom” to the country’s enemies.A high-ranking US official has predicted that Kim Jong-un could soon declare an assault on the US, amid harsh sanctions and growing dissatisfaction among his population.General Walter Sharp said any attacks would “quickly escalate into a much bigger conflict” and bring all-out war to the West.It is believed that North Korea now has the ability to fire nuclear missiles with a large enough range to reach the US.A nuclear war could result in the global population being reduced by 45% as temperatures drop by up to 30% – approaching Ice Age levels.Nuclear Darkness predict that World War Three could even trigger a mass extinction event, similar to the one which wiped out dinosaurs 65million years ago.
