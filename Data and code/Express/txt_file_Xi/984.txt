  GETTYKim Jong-un showcased his new missiles at the Day of the Sun paradeAdmiral Harry Harris, head of the US Pacific Command, told Congress the US would be ready “with the best technology” to defeat any North Korean missile threats.The remarks came during a classified briefing at the White House, which Democrat Chris Coons described as “sobering”.The US has deployed a number of warships and a submarine to the Korean peninsula, despite China’s argument that a newly deployed US Thaad missile system could destabilise security.Three people were taken to hospital after protesters clashed with police as the anti-missile system was delivered on Wednesday.There have been increasing tensions amid rising fears that North Korea could be planning further missile or nuclear tests.

    President Trump invited all 100 senators to the briefing, which took place in a building next to the White House.Admiral Harris went on to say that the relationship between Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping remained "positive and encouraging".He said: "It is purely a defensive system. It is aimed north, not west. It poses no threat to China."His comments come after China launched its second aircraft carrier in the latest sign of its growing military strength.The as-yet unnamed ship was transferred into the water in the north-eastern port of Dalian, state media said, and reports suggest it will be operational by 2020.
