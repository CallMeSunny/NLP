      REUTERSTalks on North Korea's missile programmes have been high on Trump's agenda during his Asia tour Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov revealed increasingly hostile ties between the two superpowers mean they are yet to agree on a solution to the ongoing North Korea crisis.He said: “There is no cooperation so far. Only periodic exchanges of views.”However, the Kremlin has confirmed that Vladimir Putin will discuss the North Korea issue with Resident Trump when the pair meet in Vietnam in the coming days.While the Trump administration refuses to take the option of military intervention in North Korea off the table, Russia and China are adamant that diplomacy is the only way to relieve the tensions on the Korean peninsula.Despite this assertion, Russian bombers have joined the US in conducting drills over the region in recent days.  EPAPresident Trump shakes hands with his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-inThe Russian Defence Ministry announced US and Japanese jets had escorted two of its missile-carrying Tupolev-95MS strategic bombers as they conducted flights over the Sea of Japan and the Pacific.In a statement, Moscow’s defence ministry said: "Two strategic bombers Tupolev-95MS of Russia’s Aerospace Force have carried out routine flights over international waters of the Sea of Japan and the western part of the Pacific Ocean. “At certain sections of the route the Tupolev-95MS crews were accompanied by a pair of F-18 fighters (of the US Air Force), and a pair of F-15, F-4 and F-2A fighters (of the Japanese Air Force).”
