    The war mongering state responded to the sanctions on Monday saying that it would never dismantle its nuclear and missile arsenal.North Korea is committed to a policy of simultaneous nuclear and economic development, known as the “byungjin policy”.The hermit nation also accused the US of “trying to drive the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war” and warning Washington against “believing that its land is safe across the ocean”.
