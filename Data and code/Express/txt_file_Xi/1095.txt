   The People’s Bank of China set the yuan mid-point at 6.6497 to the US dollar before the markets opened today, which is its weakest fixing since August 2017.This move is sparking concerns that Washington and Beijing’s spat over tariffs could escalate into a full-blown trade war.Mr Trump’s administration is planing to put a 25 percent duty on £25.78billion ($34billion) worth of Chinese products that cover more than 800 product categories.In retaliation, China’s President Xi Jinping’s government is also planning to slap a 25 percent tax on US goods worth the same amount.

    However, Iris Pang, a greater China economist at ING doesn’t think the fall in the value of the yuan will cause a repeat of 2015.He said: “11 August 2015 was a crisis caused by the central bank."Today's depreciation is market-driven, reflecting the risks of a trade war. This implies that the central bank is allowing market forces to dictate the speed of the depreciation when there is room to do so.”A Singapore-based senior sovereign analyst at BNY Mellon Investment Management said there isn’t cause for alarm as the yuan is experiencing a downturn at the same time the US experiencing an upturn.Aninda Mitra said: “I detected increasing alarm over trade tensions and a lot of nervousness about a full blown trade war, which comes at a bad time for China where the economy is undergoing a downdraft at the same time the United States is seeing a sharp upturn."There is undoubtedly cause for concern, but not alarm on the prospects for the Chinese yuan. A lot of people are not thinking through the range of outcomes and the limitations on policy flexibility from a seemingly inexorable slide into an escalating trade war."
