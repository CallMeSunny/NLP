    var brightcoveBrandsafety='4 Sport and specialist news &ndash; passed for ad targeting' China made history at the start of the year when its Chang’e 4 lander and Yutu 2 rover becomes the first to explore of the moon's far side. But the country’s extraterrestrial ambitions will not end there. China will begin work on a moonbase within the next decade to ready for future missions to the Red Planet.
