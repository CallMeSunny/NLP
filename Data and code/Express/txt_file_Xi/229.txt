It notes ongoing tension over the status of Taiwan is a key factor in China’s huge investment in its military forces in recent years.

World War 3: China warns the US to stay out of Taiwan Taiwan, officially the Republic of China, is a disputed east Asian territory to the west of mainland China.Xi Jinping’s superstate claims the island as its own - but the Taiwanese maintain they are an independent people.The dispute surrounding the sovereignty of Taiwan has led to heightened tensions between Beijing and Taipei, which the DIA noted in its new report.Of his findings on Chinese aggression in the region, DIA Director Robert Ashley said: “Beijing's longstanding interest to eventually compel Taiwan's reunification with the mainland and deter any attempt by Taiwan to declare independence has served as the primary driver for China's military modernisation.”READ MORE: WW3 THREAT: China develops ‘impenetrable’ system  Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers marching with their bayonettes during a military parade (Image: GETTY)Mr Ashley argued China’s “robust, lethal force” was capable of dominating “air, maritime, space and information domains”, which could allow the superpower to undermine US interests.He said: “China is building a robust, lethal force with capabilities spanning the air, maritime, space and information domains which will enable China to impose its will in the region.“As it continues to grow in strength and confidence, our nation’s leaders will face a China insistent on having a greater voice in global interactions, which at times may be antithetical to US interests.”China’s development of “a range of systems to deter and deny foreign regional force projection” is driven by fear foreign forces might attempt to interfere in an operation to take Taiwan, the report states.READ MORE: China and USA at WAR: How Chang’e 4 is major challenge with NASA Related articles   Global economic crash fears as eurozone and China slump in markets   China reveal plans to ‘COLONISE space’ by building HOUSES on the Mo...   China's Peoples' Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers (Image: GETTY)   China has tripled its military spending since 2002 hitting roughly £155billion last year, the report says.The amount is still significantly less than the US military budget of £544billion.But the DIA claimed Beijing has committed less to research and development funding because it has bought or stolen the best technology developed in other nations.The report states: “China shifted funds and efforts to acquiring technology by any means available.
