   The comments came during a joint press conference alongside South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who is in Washington for talks on the ongoing nuclear threat from the hermit nation.President Trump said he and his South Korean counterpart are “in the process of discussing our many options” to deal with North Korea.He said that the regime’s nuclear and ballistic missiles programme required a "determined response”, adding that his administration was “working closely with South Korea and Japan, as well as partners around the world, on a range of diplomatic, security and economic measures to protect our allies and our own citizens from this menace known as North Korea.”  GETTYPresident Trump says the 'era of patience is frankly over'Standing alongside President Moon in the White House's Rose Garden, he said: "The era of strategic patience with the North Korean regime has failed. ... Frankly, that patience is over." He added that the US is facing "the threat of the reckless and brutal regime in North Korea," adding the North Korean regime "has no regard for the safety and security of its people or its neighbours."He continued: "The North Korean dictatorship has no regard for the safety and security of its people or its neighbors and has no respect for human life -- and that's been proven over and over again."

    The pair also said they made progress during discussions of options to counter North Korean provocations, with President Trump saying: “We have many options with respect to North Korea - he did not, however, elaborate on what those options might be.The South Korean President's visit to the White House comes amid an increasing sense of urgency concerning North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and after President Trump approved a series of measures designed to ratchet up pressure on North Korea.  REUTERSDonald Trump has also stepped up pressure on ChinaRecent actions by the White House show that new steps might be underway to pressure China to do more to tackle threats from Kim Jong-un’s regime.In a flurry of announcements likely to antagonise Beijing, the Trump administration appeared to throw its China policy into reverse, significantly cooling relations between the two super powers.In the space of a week, the US finalised a $1.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan, labelled China one of the world's worst human traffickers and imposed sanctions on a Chinese bank for doing business with North Korea.President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had previously enjoyed an unusually cordial relationship since their first February meeting in Florida, with the US president describing Xi as a "terrific person" with whom he had a "very good relationship."In exchange for Xi's agreement to help restrain North Korea, the Trump administration loosened or withdrew US pressure in other areas - including the South China Sea and Donald Trump's previous campaign pledge to label China a currency manipulator.However, on June 21, Donald Trump sent a tweet saying Chinese efforts to restrain North Korea had "not worked out," while adding that he greatly appreciated that they had "tried."
