  GETTYChina's plans to build a nuclear power plant on the disputed land 'moving steadily'The nuclear power plant aims to primarily provide power for people living in the city of Sansha but construction of the energy resource has infuriated surrounding countries who also believe they have a claim to the maritime area, as well as the US.Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all also believe they have sovereignty over the sea.China’s People’s Daily, owned by the Communist Party have reported that the new power plant will increase the state’s military presence in the area.

    China built more than 290,000 square meters of new land in 2017 alone.Jay Batongbacal, professor at the University of the Philippines College of Law, has warned that China’s actions are likely to not only infuriate neighbours but also the US.He said: “With China's innovations and establishment of these artificial islands and the kinds of facilities that they are installing, the United States feels threatened already by this because this time weapons are being installed there.”   He added that the construction of military infrastructure on the islands in the sea is “nothing that has ever been seen before in this area in the past years”.The US has previously used its military presence in the area to forcefully raise their concerns regarding China’s claim to the territory.In October three US ships, the USS Chafee, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, sailed passed the Paracel islands to challenge China’s “excessive maritime claims" in the region.
