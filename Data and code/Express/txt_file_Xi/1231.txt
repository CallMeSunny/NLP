   The new tariffs announced by Washington and Beijing this week marks a major deterioration in relations between the two countries – with one expert warning there is a "more realistic possibility of turning this trade war into a real war" if relations continue to sour.The Trump administration recently imposed a tariff start rate of 10 percent on about $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.The increase will go into effect next week but will increment by 25 percent at the begging of next year, and perhaps increase even further on an additional $267 billion worth of imports.China hit back at the United States on Tuesday, announcing it would impose tariffs on up to $60 millions worth of US goods.

This may cause an increase in inflation, given that American consumers will face higher prices on daily necessities, ultimately eroding their disposable income.Furthermore, China’s reaction of imposing tariffs on $60 billion of US products, witness the variety of tools that Beijing has, including devaluation of yuan and possible boycott of foreign products, to “harm” American interests in China.An example of this is American smartphones such as iPhones, which are produced in China.According to Mr Moscone, history shows there are no winners in a trade war.   In 2002, the George W. Bush Administration placed tariffs on imports of certain steel products, which led to a significant decline in the US’ gross domestic product (GDP), with around 200,000 jobs lost.Such a process is called protectionism, where restrictions are made to boost your country's industry, and shield it from foreign competition.A 2003 study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, estimated that the tariffs may have temporarily increased steel industry employment by around 3,500 workers — but at a cost to consumers of around $400,000 per job.A protectionist policy also increases frauds as instruments to circumvent increase in tariffs, which are very difficult to spot at the expenses of the fiscal revenues such as taxes, fees, products and exploitation of the country.
