A points based system does not give you that controlTheresa MayA system similar to Australia, where points are awarded for immigrants' age, English language proficiency, education and job worthiness, was one of the key arguments for the Leave campaign during the EU Referendum campaign.Speaking at her first international summit as PM, she added: “I want a system where the Government is able to decide who comes into the country."I think that’s what the British public want. A points based system means people come in automatically if they meet the criteria.”     GettyTheresa May was speaking to the G20 meeting in Hangzhou, China  PATheresa May was talking on the second day of the 11th G20 summit, in Hangzhou, ChinaWHAT IS A POINTS BASED SYSTEM?The Prime Minister earlier said a points based system was “not a silver bullet” to reducing the numbers coming to the UK.She was accused of backsliding on immigration by outgoing Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who said that "watering down" the system backed by the Leave side in the EU referendum would lead to real anger.The Tory leader said the Government will be announcing alternative proposals in "due course".     PAMrs May met Vladimir Putin in China ahead of the summit which started on SundayMrs May said she believes Britain needs a system where the Government decides who can enter and who cannot, without an automatic points system, which can easily be "abused".She used the example of overseas students when she was Home Secretary, saying some were allowed in straight away because they met the criteria, but they had no idea what course they were meant to be studying or anything about the university they were supposed to be attending.Mrs May said that as Home Secretary she was told by immigration officers that the most important thing the Government should focus on was students who had met the criteria to come to the UK but did not appear to be heading for a genuine course."Because they met the criteria, they were automatically allowed in," she said."That's the problem with a points-based system."   She said the UK still has a major role to play in advancing free trade and making sure economies "work for everyone".Mrs May said she had had "good discussions" with fellow leaders about how to confront the "global challenges of terrorism and migration".
