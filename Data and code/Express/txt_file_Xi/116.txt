  AP•REUTERS•GETTYQueen Elizabeth II, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Madame Peng Liyuan and the Duke of Edinburgh todayThe Queen and Duke of Edinburgh greeted President Xi at London's Horse Guards Parade today to mark a so-called "golden era" of closer ties between Britain and China.David Cameron watched on and brushed off concerns over China's human rights record and the country's role in crippling Britain's steel industry.Today it was confirmed that Tata Steel will axe another 1,200 jobs, and Caparo Industries is set to fold putting 1,800 out of work.Critics have warned that Britain will "rue the day" it forged deeper ties with China and accused the Government of acting like a "panting puppy" in its relations with the country.But the Prime Minister insisted the meeting at Henry VIII's former jousting yard was an important moment in relations between the two nations.
