  Michelle Obama will remain in Washington rather than meet China's First LadyCommunist Party bosses had expected the summit in California to be the perfect opportunity to showcase Peng Liyuan, a glamorous singer and military general.However, Mrs Obama’s office has told the New York Times the first lady would remain in with her daughters who are coming to the end of their academic year.Mrs Obama’s noticeable absence may be interpreted as a snub, analysts have now said.China's President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan First lady diplomacy is also very important and the US side has failed to cooperateZhang MingZhang Ming, a political scientist from China’s Renmin University, said Mrs Obama’s absence would “not go down very well” in Beijing.“First lady diplomacy is also very important and the US side has failed to cooperate,” he said.“According to normal diplomatic etiquette this is very strange. It shouldn’t be like this.” The prominence and popularity of China’s elegant first lady is previously unknown in the Communist era. “This is a new kind of first lady,” Cheng Li, a senior fellow on China policy at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based research organisation, said.Since the Chinese are “extremely sensitive,” Mrs. Obama’s absence “certainly needs some explanation," he added.Michelle Obama threatened to leave a fundraiser after a gay-rights heckler interrupted her speechThe American first lady has already been under fire after a lesbian protester interrupted her speech at a Washington D.C. political fundraiser last night.While the president's wife was speaking at the event, a protester demanded that Barack Obama issue an executive order forcing federal contractors to stop discriminating against gay and transgendered job applicants.The "most notable part of the event was an interruption from a protester about 12 minutes into the 20-minute speech," Amanda Terkel, a Huffington Post reporter, who served as the night's 'pool' reporter, revealed."A pro-LGBT rights individual standing at the front began shouting for an executive order on gay rights," she said."One of the things I don't do well is this," replied Mrs Obama to loud applause, according to the writer."She left the lectern and moved over to the protester, saying they could 'listen to me or you can take the mic, but I'm leaving. You all decide. You have one choice,'" Terkel said.When the protester was removed from the event, Terkel wrote, she shouted about being a "lesbian looking for federal equality before I die."The White House appears to have deleted the heated exchange from the official transcript of the event, with only a note mentioning a "(Inaudible audience interruption.)"
