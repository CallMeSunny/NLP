We have taken an incremental approach, and despite the best of intentions, it has not worked.”But British Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon claimed the US wanted to “leave no stone unturned” to find a non-military solution to the crisis.He said: "The United States is perfectly entitled to make all the preparations it needs to protect its people, its bases, its own homeland, and they are clearly doing that at the moment to make sure the president has all the options that he needs."But equally, Secretary Mattis and I and others across the administration are very clear that we have to absolutely exhaust every possible diplomatic avenue to get this situation under control now.  North Korea claims to have detonated an H-bomb (Image: GETTY)"That means working intensively in New York (at the UN) over the next few days to get a new resolution, it means looking at the existing sanctions and making sure they are properly enforced, it means looking at the European Union level at what sanctions can be applied there, and above all it means putting more pressure on China to deal with its neighbour."China is focused on solving the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue through talks and peaceful means, Chinese President Xi Jinping told Mr Trump.The US and South Korea have asked the United Nations to consider tough new sanctions on North Korea after its nuclear test on Sunday that Pyongyang said was a advanced hydrogen bomb.Washington and its allies have said there is a growing urgency for China, North Korea's top trading partner, to apply more pressure on its already isolated neighbour to get it to back down on its nuclear weapons and missiles programmes.China "unswervingly" works to realise denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula and to safeguard the international nuclear non-proliferation system, Xi told Mr Trump, according to a statement from China's Foreign Ministry.
