   The US President reportedly ranted on the phone to Mr Hollande creating tensions with Washington’s ally. Donald Trump, who has been calling numerous world leaders since becoming President of the United States, used the call to accuse NATO and China of taking advantage of America. A senior official with knowledge of the call told Politico the billionaire declared France can continue contributing to NATO but the US “wants our money back”. Mr Trump seemed to be “obsessing over money” during the unconventional call, according to the official.   AFP/ REUTERSDonald Trump told Francois Hollande the US wants its "money back" Related articles   Trump reveals hope for a 'constructive relationship' with China    Donald Trump slammed by his own Supreme Court nominee over travel ban  It was a difficult conversation, because he talks like he’s speaking publiclySenior officialNATO sets its members a target of spending two per cent of GDP on defence, with France falling short and the US the biggest contributor to the alliance. The official said: “It was a difficult conversation, because he talks like he’s speaking publicly.“It’s not the usual way heads of state speak to each other. He speaks with slogans, and the conversation was not completely organised.”The US-France call took place on January 28, and at the time a statement from Mr Hollande’s office said the French President told his counterpart: “In an unstable and uncertain world, turning inward would be a dead-end.”Also on the agenda was the fight against Islamic State and climate change despite Mr Trump’s claim the issue was invented by China. The White House said the conversation was focused and saw Mr Trump express his support for NATO. In a statement, Washington said: “President Trump reaffirmed the US commitment to NATO and noted the importance of all NATO Allies sharing the burden on defence spending. “The leaders also lauded our combined efforts to eliminate ISIS in Iraq and Syria.”A member of the National Security Council staff said claims Mr Trump ranted over money were a “mischaracterisation”.   AFPMr Trump's diplomacy style has come under fire following his phone calls with world leaders  EPAFrancois Hollande's office said the call discussed ISIS and climate changeThe staffer, a communications aide, said: “They did discuss the issue of countries meeting their defence commitments under NATO.

    He said he remains concerned about Mr Trump’s antagonistic calls with foreign leaders. During his week in office, Mr Trump made calls to Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel as well as the leaders of Japan and Mexico. Staff at the State Department were said to be furious after the US President made the calls with little guidance from them. Officials at the agency usually extensively brief US Presidents before the calls take place.It comes as Mr Trump attempted to thaw relations with China and wrote a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping saying he was looking forward to working together. The White House said: "President Trump stated that he looks forward to working with President Xi to develop a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China.”
