    The two leaders have already been photographed shaking hands and embracing several times, which could be an attempt by President Trump to sneer Angela Merkel.Three weeks ago, the German chancellor was left grimacing and looking extremely awkward at the White House after the 70-year-old businessman refused to shake hands with her.As they posed in the Oval Office for official pictures, photographers could be heard calling for the two to shake hands. Mrs Merkel smiled and asked Mr Trump: “Do you want to have a handshake?”, but was embarrassingly ignored.Upon the Chinese President’s arrival in Florida yesterday afternoon, he received a charming welcome from US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who ushered Mr Xi across the red carpet through Palm Beach International Airport.But the Prime Minister is said to have the best and most “special relationship” with the US President. Mrs May and Mr Trump were photographed holding hands as they walked through the White House.
