      GETTYMr Trump is still concerned with China's financial practicesHe added: “I would talk to them first.“Certainly they are manipulators. But I’m not looking to do that.”Despite toning down his rhetoric and approaching the eastern superpower with diplomacy, Mr Trump is still concerned with their financial practices - particularly their approach to devaluing currency.The President-elect said: “Instead of saying, ‘We’re devaluating our currency,’ they say, 'Oh, our currency is dropping.’ It’s not dropping. They’re doing it on purpose.
