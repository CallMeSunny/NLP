    Speaking at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, Mr Coates said: "North Korea is an increasingly grave national security threat to the United States because of its growing missile and nuclear capabilities combined with the aggressive approach of its leader, Kim Jong-un.“Kim is attempting to prove he has the capability to strike the US mainland with a nuclear weapon."It's clear that we have assessed this as a very significant, potentially existential threat to the United States that has to be addressed.“We have dedicated a very significant amount of our intelligence resources to the issue of North Korea."His comments come after the CIA announced its new task force which will focus on “nuclear and ballistic” threats from the communist state.   While CIA Director Mike Pompeo hailed China for making efforts to reign North Korea's aggression in unprecedented ways, Mr Coats was full of criticism.The National Intelligence Director urged China’s President Xi Jinping to do more.He said: "The intelligence suggests we're going to need more to shake free this terribly challenging problem. And that they could do more. And they have the capacity to do more as well.” The U.S. and South Korea Launch Operation Max Thunder Thu, April 20, 2017The US and South Korea kicked off a big exercise just as North Korea threatens 'thermonuclear war'.
