   North Korea claims that it has successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching anywhere in the world.The US and Japan had reported that the missile was an intermediate range weapon.Donald Trump mocked Kim Jong-un on Twitter shortly after the launch on US Independence Day.9pm: Pentagon assessments of the missile, dubbed the Hwasong-14, said North Korea had tested a “land-based, intermediate-range” missile that landed in the Sea of Japan just under 600 miles from its launch point Panghyon Airfield, near the Chinese border.But government and independent analyses showed the missile traveling in a steep arc that topped out at more than 1,740 vertical miles above the Earth’s surface.US assessments have indicated that if the the missile had flown in a more typical trajectory, the missile would have easily traveled 4,000 miles, potentially putting all of Alaska within its range, according to former government officials and independent analysts. A missile that exceeds a range of 3,400 miles is classified as an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM.8.30pm: It is widely speculated that Donald Trump will widen the range of economic sanctions aimed at North Korea and companies that do business with the regime.However, murmurs coming out of Washington indicate that the US President is likely to try and resolve the issue more swiftly. The White House has let it be known that the Republican administration is actively reviewing plans for a possible strike on the country over its continuing nuclear missile programme.Any conflict though, if undertaken, would undoubtedly bring in South Korea and China, as well as possibly Russia.7.27pm: North Korea’s ICBM test puts the hermit state en route to strike the US, according to a shock claim.Calculations by David Wright of the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, reveal that the missile has the potential to strike the US mainland. The Pentagon and State Department are currently working on their own assessment of the danger.5.58pm: North Korea has plunged global markets into a brief moment of uncertainty after its incontinental ballistic missile test caused shares to pull back.The South Korean won fell into a 16-week low with Asian shares being notably pushed lower.Europe also felt the aftermaths of the test with a modest drop in shares amid claims Pyongyang can now strike “anywhere in the world”. 5.09pm: Donald Trump’s administration and military officials are holding an impromptu meeting to determine if North Korea fired an ICBM or not, according to CNN.A senior administration official told the news network that military experts were reviewing  intelligence gathered by US satellites."The claim is being taken seriously,” the official said.If the meeting determines that Pyongyang did successfully carry out an ICBM test, then President Trump will approve a "measured response”. 4.09pm: Russia and China are joining their diplomatic forces to call on the US, North Korea, and South Korea to sign a Chinese de-escalation plan.In a joint statement from the Chinese and Russian foreign ministries, the two countries outlined their desire to suspend Pyongyang’s nuclear missiles programme."The situation in the region affects the national interests of both countries," the joint statement said. "Russia and China will work in close coordination to advance a solution to the complex problem of the Korean Peninsula in every possible way."

    2.20pm: Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has decried North Korea's latest missile launch as “a breach of a UN Security Council resolution”, the RIA news agency reported.Mr Ryabkov reportedly added that tensions with Pyongyang risked leading to catastrophic developments, and that the only way forward was to organise multilateral talks with North Korea.2.10pm:  Russian President Vladimir Putin said he has agreed with China’s Xi Jinping on the need for simultaneous freezing of North Korea’s missile and nuclear programme and  US-South Korea military exercises.The US previously held a large-scale joint training exercise with South Korea in April as tensions flared between Washington and Pyongyang. The drill utilised fighter jets, tanks and attack helicopters.Donald Trump also sent an “armada” of warships in the Korean peninsula this year, and stationed a THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea, despite widespread protests from locals and China.Mr Putin will meet his US counterpart Mr Trump for the first time on Friday at the G20 summit in Germany, the Kremlin confirmed earlier today.1.40pm: A new map shows the maximum range of the ballistic missiles North Korea has tested over the past few years.The infographic, by Al Jazeera, shows that the missile launched this morning (Hwasong-14) is capable of reaching Alaska but not the rest of North AmericaOnly Taepodong-2 – a rocket designed to launch spacecrafts – has a larger range, however it is not thought to be in development for weaponised use.  AL JAZEERAThis map shows the range of North Korea's missile tests12.00pm: North Korea’s objective is “to split the alliances and decouple the US from its allies in east Asia”, Daniel Pinkston, an East Asia expert at Troy University in Seoul has said.“Any North Korean theory of victory in a military conflict on the peninsula would require the exclusion of US participation in the conflict,” Mr Pinkston told Japan Times.“North Korea has been trying to effect a US withdrawal from east Asia through diplomacy for decades. Now they have another instrument they could employ to try to prevent US intervention in support of its treaty allies.”As Dr John Bahadur Lamb explained to Express.co.uk earlier (10.40am update), Japan is a “staunch ally” of the US. As such, any confrontation between Japan and North Korea would inevitably involve the US.11.40am: North Korea’s state news agency has released a photo which appears to show Kim Jong-un overseeing the alleged intercontinental ballistic missile launch.The despot is seen watching the test through a pair of binoculars.  KCNAKim Jong-un has been pictured apparently watching the ICBM test10.40am: Donald Trump is unlikely to launch a military strike against North Korea, according to Dr John Bahadur Lamb, lecturer in Criminology and Security Studies at Birmingham City University.Following this morning’s missile launch, which North Korea claimed was an intercontinental ballistic missile, Mr Trump tweeted: “Hard to believe that South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all.”Dr Bahadur Lamb said that Mr Trump’s words imply that “America, or the president at least, is not interested in direct confrontation”, adding that his suggestion that Japan could intervene suggests a misunderstanding of the global order.“Japan is a staunch ally of the US, and any confrontation between Japan and North Korea would inevitably involve the US," he told Express.co.uk.Dr Bahadur Lamb explained that if North Korea’s claim to have mastered ICBM technology is true, it represents a “significant step forward in their strategic capability”.“It gives them the capability to strike all of the local actors: Taiwan, China and Japan – which is the most worrisome," he said.“It also potentially gives them the ability to strike American territory, such as Alaska.”However, Dr Bahadur Lamb said that there are some “big ifs” about Pyongyang’s claims.“North Korea’s history of missile tests is not particularly successful. “There is a possibility that this was a one-off that they might not be able to repeat.”  ReutersKim Jong-un inspects a rocket Related articles   Kim Jong-un attacks Donald Trump for inciting second Korean War   North Korea fires ballistic missile that 'could reach Alaska' 10.00am: Australia’s Foreign Minister has condemned North Korea’s latest missile launch.Julie Bishop said the test was “provocative” and in breach of several United Nations Security Council resolutions.“North Korea continues to threaten its neighbours while undermining regional and global security,” she said in a statement .“North Korea’s long-term interests would be best served by ceasing its nuclear and missiles programs, and focusing on improving the lives of its long-suffering people.”9.30am: Former British Ambassador to North Korea John Everard has suggested that a response to North Korea’s missile launch “has to be a joint effort to work”.Mr Everard told Sky News that Donald Trump’s assertion that China “will have to make a really heavy move against North Korea” is “wishful thinking”.“I doubt China has any such intention,” Mr Everard said.“A lot of the problem is the recent deterioration int he relationship between the US and China.“The Chinese will be in no mood to co-operate.”8.55am: A North Korea analyst says that Pyongyang’s claim that it has successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile is “certainly true”.Chad O’Carroll, CEO of the Seoul-based Korea Risk Group, told Express.co.uk: “The claim North Korea tested an intercontinental range missile today is certainly true, because US, Japanese, and South Korean monitoring data shows a launch consistent with the altitude, flight time and distance required during a lofted ICBM test.“North Korea ‘lofts’ its missile launches (flying them much higher than normal) so that range can be tested without impacting the airspace of neighbouring countries."North Korea’s state media has confirmed that the test was “conducted at the sharpest angle possible”.Mr O’Carroll says that the missile launch is particularly problematic for Donald Trump, who in January dismissed North Korea’s claim that it was close to developing a weapon capable of reaching the US.Mr Trump tweeted: “North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the US. It won’t happen!”Mr O’Carroll said: “Mr Trump has personalised this issue significantly since his inauguration and prioritised North Korea like no other president.“He will now be forced to respond “either through military action, a sharp-rise in sanctions and pressure, or dialogue.”8.22am: North Korea’s state broadcaster KCTV has released the first images of the alleged intercontinental ballistic missile launch.  KCTVNorth Korea has released images of its alleged ICBM launch8.00am: A weapons analyst has suggested that North Korea could be able to target Alaska but not the rest of the US.David Wright, a physicist and co-director of the UCS Global Security Program, said: "A missile of that range would need to fly on a very highly lofted trajectory to have such a long flight time."Assuming a range of 950 km, then a flight time of 37 minutes would require it to reach a maximum altitude of more than 2,800 km (1700 miles)."So if the reports are correct, that same missile could reach a maximum range of roughly 6,700 km (4,160 miles) on a standard trajectory."That range would not be enough to reach the lower 48 states or the large islands of Hawaii, but would allow it to reach all of Alaska."There is not enough information yet to determine whether this launch could be done with a modified version of the Hwasong-12 missile that was launched on May 14."  KCTVNorth Korea claims that it can now target anywhere in the world7.30am: North Korea has claimed that it has successfully tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) under the supervision of leader Kim Jong-un.The Hwasong-14 missile reached an altitude of 2,802 km (1,741 miles) and hit its target precisely after flying for 39 minutes, the North's state television reported, suggesting that the hermit state now has the technology to target "anywhere in the world"."As a strongest nuclear state with the best ICBM rockets, North Korea will end the US nuclear war threats and defense peace and stability of the Korean peninsula," a presenter said.However the reports conflict with assessments by the US and Japan, which said that the launch was an intermediate range missile, rather than an ICBM.The North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) assessed that the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.6.30am: North Korea will make a “major announcement” at 7.30am BST, South Korea’s Yonhap state news has said.<strong">6.00am: Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on Kim Jong-un after the North Korean despot launched a ballistic missile on US Independence Day.The President mocked: ”Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?”He continued by speculating that North Korea’s neighbours would be forced to act following the launch.“Hard to believe that South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer,” Mr Trump wrote.“Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!”  ReutersNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un celebrates the successful testing of the missile North Korea tests long range missile as nuclear programme continues Mon, May 22, 2017North Korea has successfully launched a ground-to-ground missile 500km towards the Sea of Japan, as tensions on the Korean peninsular reach new heights.

    5.30am: North Korea launched an intermediate range ballistic missile that flew for 37 minutes before crashing into the Sea of Japan, US military officials have said.The land-based missile was fired from near Pangyhon airfield at 9.40pm local time (1.40am BST) and flew about 930km. It is believed to have landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone.A Tokyo spokesman said that there were no reports of any damage caused by the launch, which it labelled an “extremely problematic act”."Today's ballistic missile launch was an extremely problematic act and at the same time a clear violation of the Security Council resolution. We cannot condone these repeated acts of provocation from North Korea and we have lodge our fierce complaint to the North Koreans," the spokesman said.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that he will seek to increase international pressure on North Korea, and will ask China and Russia to play more  constructive roles.  GETTY / KCTVDonald Trump has mocked Kim Jong-unSouth Korean President Moon Jae In ordered a National Security Council meeting in response to the launch.Following the meeting, a spokesman for South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said: "Our military is maintaining full preparedness against the possibility of North Korea's additional provocation," according to Seoul’s state news agency Yonhap.The missile launch came just hours after Donald Trump met the South Korean President Moon Jae-In in Washington.“Both presidents remain committed to jointly addressing the threat posed by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK),” a joint statement read.The US President also spoke to China’s Xi Jinping and Japan’s Shinzo Abe over the phone to discuss the North Korean threat.
