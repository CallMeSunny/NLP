   When Donald Trump took office last January it appeared as though tensions in the region would be a high priority on his foreign affairs agenda, but with Washington’s priorities elsewhere, China has been given free reign to enjoy its disputed claims to the neighbouring sea.Michael Fuchs, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, admitted to CNN: "The water was beautiful for China in the South China Sea in 2017."The Chinese continue to pace with their long-term strategy to gain de facto control over the sea lanes in the South China Sea. And what changed is the United States stopped paying attention.” However, 2018 could see the matter reopened if the Asian superpower continues to build islands in the region and deploy military assets on them.

    "We're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops, and second, your access to those islands also not going to be allowed."However, despite the tough talk, the Trump administration’s involvement in Asia has largely been restricted to ongoing tensions with North Korea.Now, experts say if Mr Trump fills the diplomatic posts left vacant after President Obama left office, the South China Sea dispute could return to the negotiating table.Gregory Poling, the director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI), said: "It's no secret that the Trump administration is still woefully understaffed when it comes to the Asia squad."It's no surprise that they can't focus on anything but North Korea. And occasionally they talk about trade deficits with China, but that's it."  GETTYChina's claim to the waters has sparked fury among regional neighboursIn recent days Australia has become embroiled in the dispute and a Chinese state newspaper has belittled its rival as an insignificant world power because of Canberra's "meddling" in the South China Sea row.The Global Times accused Australia of adopting a diplomatic role too closely aligned with the US.It read: "Provocations in the South China Sea may prompt China to adopt strong countermeasures which will seriously impact Australian economic development."Excessive involvement in the South China Sea has increased Canberra's strategic burden, widened the gap between its limited prowess and its goal to become a middle power. “Australia has held this goal for a long time and wants to have its position in international affairs."However, due to its small population and limited strength, Canberra hasn't stood out in global geopolitics."
