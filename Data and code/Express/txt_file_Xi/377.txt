  HandoutUS President Donald Trump says military action with North Korea is not a first choice” Mr Trump told reporters at the White House: “President Xi would like to do something. We'll see whether or not he can do it."But we will not be putting up with what's happening in North Korea.” "I believe that President Xi agrees with me 100 percent... We had a very, very frank and very strong phone call."The US President made his comments to waiting reporters at The White House after speaking to President Xi by phone at the White House on Wednesday.China made it clear that it is focused on solving the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue through talks and peaceful means.  Related articles   South Korea urges Putin to step in over North Korea testing   South Korea to SMASH Kim Jong-un's nuclear bases with 'FRANKENMISSILE' The tactic appeared to push the US President to soften his tone after the telephone call after he previously ramped up his rhetoric by vowing to rein down "fire and fury like the world has never seen" against Kim if he did not comply with his wishes and back down.And while his tone has de-escalated, Mr Trump has not ruled out attacking the rogue state with a military strike after Kim Jong-Un launched a missile last week.He said of his discussion with the Chinese president "We had a very good phone call. It lasted for a long time."   GettyThe president made his comments on Kim after speaking to President Xi by phone at the White HouseKim Jong-un was spotted in a hydrogen-bomb factory with his generals last week following North Korea's sixth nuclear test.The North's official KCNA news agency said it was a H-bomb with an "explosive power that can be adjusted from tens to hundreds of kilotons depending on the target".US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley accused North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Monday of "begging for war" and urged the Security Council to impose the "strongest possible" sanctions.Both the US and its allies are hinting that stronger sanctions may be needed against North Korea to curb its impulses.   GettyDonald Trump is piling on the pressure on China's leader to do more on North KoreaBeijing has said reining in North Korea is not chiefly its responsibility, and has expressed doubts that U.N. economic sanctions, which it has backed, will resolve the situation.Sanctions so far appear to have done little to stop North Korea from boosting its nuclear and missile capacity as it faces off with Mr Trump, who has vowed to stop Pyongyang from being able to hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear weapon.It is unclear if China will back further sanctions. Beijing fears that completely cutting off North Korea could lead to its collapse, unleashing a wave of refugees into China's northeast.  Related videos   North Korean ambassador to the UN warns US    Putin pushes for 'diplomatic' approach towards North Korea   Boris Johnson calls on China to do more to tackle North Korea  But China is one of North Korea's major trading partners.China accounted for 92 percent of North Korea's trade in 2016, according to South Korea.Mr Trump warned North Korea that its few international partners that trade with the United States could come to an end.However, all threats and sanctions have fallen on deaf ears in North Korea.

    Mr Trump has accused China in particular of not doing enough to tighten economic pressure on its smaller neighbor. But on Wednesday Trump sounded more conciliatory.Those could include an squeezing oil supplies or restricting North Korea's ability to collect remittances from workers abroad.Pyongyang appears determined to anger the international community after it recently detonated an apparent thermonuclear bomb.There are even fears it wants to target the US after a litany of other tests appeared aimed at marrying missile and nuclear technology in a way that could put the United States within striking distance.
