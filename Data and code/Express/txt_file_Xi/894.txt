  Pound US dollar exchange rate: The pound US dollar exchange rate is currently trading at $1.277 (Image: GETTY)The pound is showing only modest gains against the US dollar this morning as investors react to the UK’s latest manufacturing PMI. According to data published by IHS Markit, the UK’s manufacturing index rebounded from 51.1 to 53.1 in November, beating expectations of a more modest rise to 51.5. However while the headline PMI appeared positive, analysts warned it masked some of the underlying weakness in the sector as new export orders continued to contract, leading to forecasts the UK’s factory sector may end up dragging on growth in the fourth quarter.POUND LIVE: LATEST GBP STERLING MOVEMENT HERE Related articles   Pound to euro exchange rate: Brexit headlines impact currency   Pound LIVE: GBP under pressure against euro as May WARNED Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit stated: “Based on its relationship against official ONS data, the survey indicators suggest manufacturing output is on course to make no contribution to GDP growth in the final quarter, with a clear risk of output contracting unless December proves a stronger month.” At the same time demand for the US dollar has eased at the opening of this week’s session as investors desert safe haven currencies after the US and China agreed to a trade truce over the weekend. After a highly anticipated dinner between US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart XI Jinping on the side lines of the G20 summit, the White House announced that the two leaders had agreed to a 90-day ceasefire of their trade dispute. This resulted in a sharp drop in safe haven demand as the week opened, leaving currencies like the US dollar and the Japanese yen in the lurch this morning.   Looking ahead, the US will publish its own manufacturing PMI later this afternoon, potentially dragging on the pound US dollar exchange rate as analysts forecast growth in the US factory sector will have remained robust, if still below the 14-year high struck back in August.Meanwhile the release of the UK’s latest construction PMI is likely to heap more pressure on the pound tomorrow amid expectations that Britain’s builders will have seen activity slow last month.On top of this, dwindling support for Theresa May’s Brexit deal is likely to remain an ongoing concern for pound investors over the coming week.This will likely leaving Sterling sentiment subdued if it appears unlikely the Prime Minister will be able to push the deal through the House of Commons in next week’s vote.
