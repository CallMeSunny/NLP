  GETTYPremier Li Keqiang (R) promoted “-eacefeo reunification” for Xi Jinping’s China and TaiwanPremier Li Keqiang's speech at the opening of the annual session of China’s Parliament came amid mounting Chinese anger over a US Bill that seeks to raise official contacts between Washington and Taipei.The US legislation says it should be policy to allow officials at all levels to travel to Taiwan to meet their counterparts, permit high-level Taiwan officials to enter America “under respectful conditions” and meet US officials.The bill only needs President Donald Trump’s signature to become law.In his address to the largely rubber-stamp assembly, Li said China would promote the peaceful growth of relations across the Taiwan Strait and “advance China’s peaceful reunification”.
