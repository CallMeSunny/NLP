A spectacular fireball after the explosion in Jiangsu province (Image: GETTY)Jiangsu will carry out inspections on chemical producers and warehouses, according to an emergency notice published by official media on Friday.The notice, which was published on the news website of Jiangsu province's Communist Party, said the government would shut down any chemical firms found not to be complying with regulations on dangerous chemicals.Public anger over safety standards has grown in China as a result of industrial accidents which have ranged from mining disasters to factory fires, and which have marred three decades of swift economic growth.In 2015, 165 people were killed in a series of explosions at a chemical warehouse in the northern city of Tianjin.   The explosions at Tianjin, which is one of the world's busiest ports and which is close to the capital, Beijing, were big enough to be seen by satellites and register on earthquake sensors.Despite repeated pledges by the government to tighten safety, chemical plants in particular have been plagued by disasters.Last July, a blast at a chemical plant in southwest Sichuan province left 19 dead and 12 injured.And in November, a series of blasts during the delivery of a flammable gas at a chemical manufacturer killed 23 people.
