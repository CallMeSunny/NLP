  GETTYChina is confident it will be the first to make contact with Alien LifeLast year China cemented itself as a space exploration powerhouse by firing its space laboratory Tiangong 2 into low Earth orbit, becoming only the third nation, after the US and Russia, to independently get people into space.The nation has also has had dozens of suspected-paranormal encounters including claims of a UFO sighting over the Great Wall of China last week.Now the emboldened ‘space superpower’ has vowed it will be the first to make contact with alien life pouring billions of pounds into space exploration and the world’s largest radio dish to detect signals from other galaxies.Speaking about the Tiangong 2 mission President Xi Jinping, said that the project would "enable China to take larger and further steps in space exploration, and make new contributions to building up China as a space power”.

    Other leading experts into Alien Life including astrophysicist Andrew Siemion, the director of the Search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) research centre at Berkley University have also been impressed by FAST.Radio transmissions are forbidden near the dish in a bid to stop human sources interfering with any signals coming from alien sources.China’s latest five-year plan pledges to increase spending on research and development to £913billion ($1.2trillion)—at least 2.5 per cent of its gross domestic product – with deep Space exploration at the forefront.The plan was adopted in March 2016 and will see it through to 2020 and this latest radio observatory is not going to be China’s last as the country reportedly plans to put one on the dark side of the moon.These latest development follow an investigation into mysterious “UFO-like” pieces of metals fell from the sky and blasted into the ground near several villages in central China.
