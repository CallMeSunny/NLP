   Donald Trump has said that China has turned a fleet of North Korean coal ships back, calling it a “big step” towards tackling Kim Jong-un’s despot regime.China banned all imports of coal from its neighbour in February in response to Pyongyang’s continued missile tests.Earlier this week Mr Trump said that he had a “very productive” phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping about North Korea.It came after he tweeted: “North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them!“I explained to the President of China that a trade deal with the US will be far better for them if they solve the North Korean problem!”Donald Trump warned that the US is “sending an armada” to waters off the Korean peninsula as a US Navy strike group heads towards the region.  It comes after Mr Trump encouraged Chinese President to do more to rein in North Korea, which sends a vast majority of its exports to its giant neighbour.   GettyChinese President  Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump shake hands in Florida Related articles   Xi Jinping calls Donald Trump to come to solution on North Korea   Japan's navy plans exercises with US ships Xi Jinping yesterday called for a "peaceful" resolution to tensions over North Korea during a telephone call with Donald Trump, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. The Chinese President stressed that China is committed to “denuclearisation” and peace and stability on the peninsula but “advocates resolving problems through peaceful means”.The telephone call suggests that China is trying to stop the Trump administration from considering the option of unilateral military action against North Korea. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang warned: "We hope that the relevant parties do not adopt irresponsible actions. Under the current circumstances, this is very dangerous.”  Although China has warned against the dangerous consequences of military action, it appears willing to help the US to put some more pressure on North Korea through sanctions.Mr Xi did not make a public commitment to tighten pressure on North Korea after a face-to-face meeting with Mr Trump in Florida last week. But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the press that Mr Jinping understands that “action has to be taken” to address the growing North Korea nuclear threat.   On Monday China and South Korea agreed to slap tougher sanctions on North Korea if the country carries out nuclear or long-range missile tests, according to an official in Seoul.  America and South Korea prepare for war against North Korea Tue, April 11, 2017U.S. and South Korean marines participate in the endurance exercise in temperature below minus 20 degrees celsius under a scenario to defend the country from any possible attacks from North Korea.

    China has ordered its trading companies to return coal from North Korea after banning imports of North Korean coal in February, according to trading sources. The Asian world power seems unwilling to take military action at present. But the situation will change if Kim Jong-un regime threatens northeastern regions of China. The article in the Communist-party affiliated Global Times said: “China has a bottom line that it will protect at all costs, that is, the security and stability of northeast China.“If the bottom line is touched, China will employ all means available including the military means to strike back.”
