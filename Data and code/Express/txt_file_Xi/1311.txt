  GETTYThe plane which carries the U.S. President is traditionally referred to as Air Force OnePacked with on-board luxuries, defence weapons systems and extra fuel tanks to save refuelling, they are aviation’s answer to the top flight. While some high-flyers manage with only one aeroplane, others have entire fleets of customised aircraft at their disposal says a new report on the private jets of the most influential people on Earth.Air Charter Service, which specialises in niche transportation for VIPs, compared 13 world leaders from the Queen to Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Analysing the value of their planes, their special security features and interior modifications, they found that the sky isn’t always the limit when it comes to government charters for heads of state.A spokesman said: “Some surprising nuances can be found in our comparative analysis of the world leaders and their grandeur, or in some cases modesty, with their travel for important affairs of state.”  Related articles   Kushner reportedly sought secret communication channel with Russia   North Korea LIVE: Donald Trump plans missile test as Kim mocks US     Some surprising nuances can be found in our comparative analysis of the world leaders and their travelAir Charter ServiceTake China’s President Xi Jinping who, despite representing 1.4 billion people, does not have his own plane. The Communist leader of the People’s Republic instead uses two Boeing 747-400s belonging to Air China for government visits and business trips, which are used as regular passenger planes when he doesn’t need them.The £195million planes are taken out of service, security checked for several weeks, then completely refitted with a spacious living room, bedroom and office replacing the cabin seats when he needs them. The interiors are reported to be “rather austere and far from lavish or luxurious” and afterwards the cabin seats are returned.That’s a far cry from the Sultan of Brunei’s £170million plane, nicknamed the “Flying Palace”. Prince Hassanal Bolkiah bought the Airbus A340-12 for £80million and spent a further £95million decorating a luxurious cabin with precious metals and gems.   GETTYThe Sultan of Brunei's 'flying palace' is decked with gadgets and luxuriesExtra fuel tanks give it a 10,000 mile flight range. The monarch also owns a Boeing 747-430, a Boeing 767-270 and two Sikorsky S-70 helicopters. But that’s nothing compared to Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar. One of the world’s wealthiest people with an estimated £2billion fortune, his 14 Airbuses are thought to be worth more than £1billion.Why does one man need so many planes? On official trips the Emir is accompanied by an entourage of at least 1,000 including family and official delegation and service staff. The cargo often includes limousines used by the Emir at the destination country, which is why most of the Emir’s official and unofficial trips abroad are completed by multiple planes.Qatar’s delegation once used 10 aircraft for negotiations with Japan’s prime minister and eight aircraft for a visit to Switzerland. The Emir not only holds the record for having the biggest air delegation but also the most expensive fleet. All of which makes US President Donald Trump’s heavily modified Boeing 747-2000B look rather tame.  BARCROFTVladimir Putin's plane is reinforced to protect from land-based attacksAmerica’s Commander-in-Chief relies on two identical customised aircraft and a more compact Boeing C-32 when flying to smaller airports. Air Force One, the general name describing any United States Air Force aircraft carrying the president at any time, is located at the Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, Virginia. The specially designed 747s have a better fuel economy and longer flight range than the original model, with alterations effectually allowing refuelling in-flight, allowing it to remain in the sky for an indefinite period. Security systems protect from standard attacks and occurrences such as targeted electromagnetic impulses.There’s an onboard medical suite that is a fully functioning operating room, in common with the King of Bahrain’s fleet of six aircraft. Air Force One’s interior includes a cabin area exceeding 370 square metres, a bedroom, bathroom, gym and offices, with a separate area for accompanying news reporters.

    Having been in use for more than 25 years the aircraft, which cost £100million each to build, are older than the planes used by Japan’s prime minister, the King of Saudi Arabia and the Sultan of Brunei.Vladimir Putin’s IL-96-300PU features similar security upgrades to Air Force One, with several layers of protection for the Russian president against potential attacks from land and air. The £500million aircraft’s body has a special coating that makes the plane less visible to RCS, an automated system of jamming and disorienting radar, as well as its own anti-aircraft defence system.The interior was designed by Ivan Glazunov, son of the Russian artist Ilya Glazunov, and is decorated with tapestries and gold accents finished in neoclassical style, with a spacious office, bedroom and fully-equipped gym. For security reasons four identical planes are prepared for departure and the one used by the president is not known until take-off.  GETTYTheresa May's Airbus A330 has the largest passenger capacity of world leaders' jetsEuropean leaders are more modest when it comes to air travel, according to the 21-page report compiled by Claire Ellis. Prime Minister Theresa May’s Airbus A330 has minor alterations such as a small curtained-off VIP area with leather ottoman chairs at the front and 58 business class seats for ministers and staff and 100 economy class seats for journalists.The A330, worth an estimated £195million, has the biggest passenger capacity of jets used by world leaders, accommodating 160 in total. By comparison German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Airbus A340-313X VIP, known as the Konrad Adenauer after Germany’s postwar chancellor, carries 143 passengers. Additional fuel tanks allow flights of up to 8,500 miles.The £230million aircraft has bedrooms, showers, offices, a conference hall with video communication equipment and soundproof room for negotiations. Should come in useful for all that “blue sky thinking” needed in the forthcoming Brexit talks.
