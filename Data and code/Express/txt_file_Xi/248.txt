   Professor Steve Tsang, the director of the China Institute at the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), said China has no reason to get involved in resolving the stand-off between US leader Donald Trump and dictator Kim Jong-un.China has come under increasing pressure to intervene as North Korea says it has developed a weapon capable of striking the mainland US. US President Donald Trump has urged Beijing to exert pressure on North Korea by slapping the rogue state with sanctions. China, North Korea’s only ally, has issued a number of economic sanctions but as tensions escalate on the Korean peninsula it is unclear how far Beijing will go to contain the crisis.   Reuters/Getty/EPAChina has no reason to get involved over North Korea, an academic has claimedProf Tsang told Express.co.uk: “Chinese leader Xi Jinping has no incentive to do it. The Chinese policy is simply to contain the problem over North Korea, not to resolve it.“But why would they want to do that? How would it look within China if they Chinese were to cripple the North Korean economy and bring them to heel and bow to the Americans then the Communist party would be seen to have done the dirty on behalf of the United States.“Then you raise the question of the whole legitimacy of the Communist party within China and Xi Jinping’s policy is to make China great again by putting China first.“To be fair, China does not like the current situation. They would have preferred the North Koreans not to have developed the nuclear weapons and the missile delivery capacity which potentially destabilised the region.

We’re not talking about a failure of Trump - a failure of American policy towards North Korea over something like 20 years.”Tensions across the entire region have worsening in recent months as Kim has been determined to push ahead with his missile and nuclear programmes despite worldwide condemnation and UN sanctions with the communist leader also engaged in a war of words and threats with US Republican leader Trump with both sides riling the other.Just days ago the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called on China to do more to stop North Korea in its objectives.  GettyDonald Trump (L) with Chinese leader Xi Jinping earlier this year Chinese leader Xi Jinping has no incentive to do it. The Chinese policy is simply to contain the problem over North Korea, not to resolve itProfessor Steve TsangKim's latest missile launch sparked fury worldwide and prompted calls for more sanctions on the rogue state. Speaking at the State Department, Mr Tillerson welcomed China’s efforts towards quelling the tensions on the Korean peninsula but urged Beijing to exert more pressure on the hermit state by limiting its oil exports to North Korea.He said: “The Chinese are doing a lot. We do think they could do more with the oil.“We're really asking them to please restrain more of the oil, not cut it off completely.“That was the most effective tool the last time the North Koreans came to the table.”For Prof Tsang, the US will have to use force if it wants the situation to be resolved, but that would mean large numbers of South Korean casualties.  ReutersNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un during the memorial for late North Korean leader Kim Jong-ilHe said: “If the situation is going to be resolved it means the Americans using force - then we are asking how many South Koreans will be dead, not to mention North Koreans. We’ll see a lot of South Koreans killed in that process.“Missile strikes won’t do much of any good because missile strikes can destroy maybe a few installations, a couple of launch sites but they cannot take out the entire nuclear capability of the North Koreans and it would only make the North Koreans more determined and potentially retaliate.“The Kim regime is not like Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Trump cannot do what he did in Syria after the last use of chemical weapons against civilians and the Assad regime did nothing in response.“Kim is running a near totalitarian dictatorship and if that system shows weakness then he is putting himself at risk, so he is likely to respond in some way rather than just ignore it.  GettyUS President Donald Trump“And then we are getting into an escalatory spiral and things can easily get out of hand and that’s not a particularly good outcome.“If they start firing missiles and shells into Seoul then you are talking about an enormous amount of casualties.”The key, for Prof Tsang, is not to worsen an already fragile situation and by worsening things this could then mean other countries in the region also then try to acquire nuclear capabilities.Prof Tsang said: “The thing is not to try to take out North Korea’s nuclear capabilities but to manage it in a way that does not result in further escalation of other countries in the region wanting to acquire nuclear weapons and the use of nuclear blackmail.“If we can do that, to me, that’s a pretty acceptable outcome.“I am not so worried about wanting to see Trump as some sort of global policeman but the problem with Trump is not so much what America can or cannot live with but more what Trump’s ego can or cannot live with.”
