    “The meeting will happen on the sidelines one way or another.”While Washington is denying a meeting will take place, the Kremlin said they understood one was likely. Mr Trump sent a strong warning to Asia-Pacific countries at the summit today, telling them America will no longer tolerate unfair trade deals.  GETTYDonald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Vietnam this eveningHaving just concluded a state visit to China, Trump said the United States was ready to make a bilateral deal with any country in the Indo-Pacific region - but only on the basis of "mutual respect and mutual benefit".He blasted the World Trade Organization and multilateral trade deals, and some analysts expect tougher action may be imminent from the White House to fight bilateral trade imbalances with China exacerbated by Beijing's state-led economic model.   It came after Mr Trump visited China to discuss future trade deals. He was given a state welcome and stated following the visit he did not hold China's deals with the USA against them - despite claiming they were unfair. He Tweeted: "I don’t blame China, I blame the incompetence of past Admins for allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. on trade leading up to a point where the U.S. is losing $100's of billions. How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue? I would've done same!“My meetings with President Xi Jinping were very productive on both trade and the subject of North Korea. He is a highly respected and powerful representative of his people. It was great being with him and Madame Peng Liyuan!”
