   North Korea has been fanning World War 3 fears with its refusal to shut down its weapons development programme.US Vice-President Mike Pence said the United States will continue to rally the support of the international community to pressure Kim into toning down his aggressive rhetoric.Mr Pence said: "We’re not going to relent until North Korea abandons its nuclear and missile programmes."All the progress we are making in the region, I believe, is a reflection of the strong and resolute leadership the President has been providing and marshalling among our allies. And even marshalling from President Xi Jinping in China."

     We’re not going to relent until North Korea abandons its nuclear and missile programmesMike Pence"To have North Korea literally be willing to sit down with South Korea – just on the topic of Olympics – I think is a direct result of the pressure President Trump has been able to marshal on North Korea."It comes after former Barack Obama aide Jon Wolfsthal revealed a review prepared by the Pentagon had recommended a new version of the Trident D5 submarine-launched missile to “deter” Russia, China and North Korea from using tactical warheads in a conflict.Mr Wolfsthal said: “What I’ve been told by the people who wrote the thing was what they were trying to do was to send a clear deterrent message to Russians, the North Koreans and the Chinese.“And there is pretty good, moderate but strong language that makes clear that any attempt by Russia or North Korea to use nuclear weapons would result in a massive consequence for them and I think that’s actually moderate, centrist and probably very much needed."The review, which could be President Trump’s signature nuclear weapons initiative in response to a growing North Korean nuclear threat, could lead to more than $1 trillion in spending over nearly 30 years.
