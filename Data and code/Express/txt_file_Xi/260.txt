   Time Magazine Paris correspondent Vivienne Walt told France24 Brexit is "weighing" on French official's minds as Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel struggle to protect the bloc from the threats of US and China. The two European leaders welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping in Paris last week after he signed a deal on an intercontinental infrastructure project with Italy. In an emergency meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, the French President and the German Chancellor blasted Italy for unilaterally pursuing the deal. But without the powerful voice of the UK, the pair may fail to make themselves heard by the Eurosceptic Italian Government led by Lega and the Five Star Movement.
