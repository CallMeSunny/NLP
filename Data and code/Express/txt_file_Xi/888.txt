  Pound US dollar exchange: GBP has had a fairly volatile start (Image: GETTY)  The pound to US dollar exchange rate has had a fairly volatile start of the week, despite the lack of data releases due to markets being closed for the New Year. This morning a better-than-expected British Markit manufacturing PMI for December showed a figure of 54.2, growing from 53.6, despite a forecast fall to 52.5. Despite this positive data, the pairing fell to a low of $1.268 this morning, as investors focused on the commentary accompanying the report. IHS Markit Director Rob Dobson said: “The trend in production volumes remained lacklustre despite the safety stock-building, with the latest survey consistent with a mild decrease in the official measure of manufacturing output over the final quarter.
