   China has the ability to control the South China Sea and the US could be forced to retreat as Beijing prepares for war. China, along with several of its neighbours including the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have been involved in a decades-long dispute over who controls the South China Sea. Xi Jinping's superstate claims most of the sea as its territory but China’s neighbours argue parts of the area belong to them. Tensions have skyrocketed in recent years and resulted in the involvement of the US.
