  Germany economic minister Peter Altmaier has said the measures are necessary (Image: GETTY)But the idea has prompted a cautious response from business leaders who want the country to remain an attractive proposition for investors.The move comes at a time when Germany is increasingly intervening stop Chinese investment, especially where it deems that advanced technology could end up in the hands of Beijing.Last month state development bank BKW was ordered to take a 20 percent stake in high-voltage power network operator 50Hertz to stop a Chinese state investor doing so.Currently, the German government can veto deals which involve the purchase of at least 25 percent of equity of a German company being bought by an investor outside of the EU, and only if it deems that the acquisition endangers public order or national security.
