    And Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier this week there were no immediate plans for a Russia-North Korea summit, or for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.A senior Chinese official visiting South Korea today said Kim’s visit to Beijing would help ease tensions and lead to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.Yang Jiechi said: “We believe (Kim's) visit will help the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, ensure peace and security of the Korean peninsula and resolve problems regarding the peninsula through political negotiations and discussions.”Mr Jiechi is expected to meet other security and diplomatic officials and brief them on Kim's visit. The Chinese envoy is also scheduled to meet the South Korean president on Friday.   Images have emerged of the Kim and China’s President Xi Jinping shaking hands and standing in front of their respective national flags.The leader of the hermit kingdom said in the meeting that he was “committed to denuclearisation” after sparking World War 3 fears with a series of missile tests.He added: “If South Korea and the US respond to our efforts in good faith, build a peaceful and stable atmosphere, and adopt phased and simultaneous steps for peace, the issue of denuclearisation on the Peninsula can be resolved.“The issue of denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula can be resolved, if South Korea and the United States respond to our efforts with goodwill, create an atmosphere of peace and stability while taking progressive and synchronous measures for the realisation of peace.”It is thought that this is Kim’s first visit to China since his father’s death in 2011.
