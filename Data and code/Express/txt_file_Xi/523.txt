  GETTYCanada's ambassador to China has warned China to back up its words with actions to avoid a trade warJohn McCallum, Canada's ambassador to China told CNBC the Chinese president has previously called for change but never followed it through.Mr McCallum explained how at the World Economic Forum in Davos last year and at the Boao forum this year the Chinese president has “used very strong language in favour of globalisation, in favour of freer trade. But it would be good if he could match those statements with actions.“Their actions have not always matched their words. So the more they could act, the more it would help the world to preserve the international system and avoid a descent into a trade war.”The tensions between the US and China have resulted in China putting a 25 percent levy on US imports, such as soybeans, cars and whiskey.

    The US back in March announced it would be placing $50billion worth of tariffs worth on Chinese imports following a seven-month investigation into the intellectual property theft by China from the US.Despite China being the biggest export market for Canadian soybeans and the nation most likely benefitting from tariffs placed on the US, the ambassador believes in general the negatives that would come with a trade war would far outweigh the benefits.Mr McCallum said: “Canada is a trading nation, and if the world trading system is in jeopardy, then Canada is hurt. So that is why even though we may have certain gains if this occurs, we still hope that there will not be a trade war and a settlement will be reached."The ambassador was recently in hot water due to his remarks on Canada’s relationship with the US and China.   He said that Ottawa, the capital of Canada has more in common with China than it does with the US.After these comments were reported he explained them further as he believed that he had been misunderstood.Mr McCallum said: “In the context of our current discussions over trade and globalisation, China's policy in some regards is closer to Canada's policy than Canada is to the US.”Still, he does see the huge importance of his country’s trade relationship with the US. As he said: “the United States has been our largest trading partner and our biggest friend, and none of that will change."   He is also reasonably positive with a free trade agreement with China, but at the same time acknowledges that the deal has proved hard to design due to different views.Mr McCallum said: “There was discussion about environment, labour, and gender. And I think the Chinese want a simpler trade deal and we want a more ambitious trade deal and that is why I think those discussions are still ongoing.""But I do believe both China and Canada would like it to happen at some point, so I'm quite optimistic even though it hasn't happened yet.”
