 President Xi consolidated power at his nation’s communist party congress, which is normally used to choose the nation’s next leader.Instead, Xi left with the presidency and no named successor – making it unlikely that his leadership will be challenged in the next decade as the nation emerges as a heavyweight superpower.He also had ‘Xi’s thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics’ enshrined in the party’s Communist Charter, making him the second living leader to be given the honour after Chairman Mao.Kim Jong-Un has grovelled to the leader as he looks for allies amid fears his conflict with the US may trigger World War 3.

    Mr Trump posted: “Spoke to President Xi of China to congratulate him on his extraordinary elevation. Also discussed NoKo & trade, two very important subjects!”In a second Tweet posted 15 minutes later, Mr Trump said: “Melania and I look forward to being with President Xi & Madame Peng Liyuan in China in two weeks for what will hopefully be a historic trip!”As tensions escalate Mr Trump’s attempts to cosy up to China will set alarm bells ringing in Pyongyang, who have relied heavily on Beijing throughout its history.However in recent months, as North Korea continues to recklessly test-fire rockets and nuclear weapons, China has begun to turn against the hermit state.Related articles   Chinese military clamp down hard on masturbating recruits  Foreign aid splashed on helping Chinese factory workers quit smoking
