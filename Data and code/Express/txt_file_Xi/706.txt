   Proposals to make life more difficult for Chinese investors to muscle in were watered down by eurocrats leaving big hitters from the east free to snap up Europoean companies in strategic sectors.France, Germany and Italy are all keen to restrict Chinese takeovers and were dismayed when their joint call on the European Commission to “examine ways to screen investments from third countries” hit the buffers.The wanted to give the Commission powers to monitor and potentially block foreign takeovers of Europe’s most cherished companies — high-tech firms like German industrial robotics maker Kuka, which was bought last year by a Chinese manufacturer of washing machines and rice cookers.But their protectionist language did not make it into the final conclusions of a June summit and was replaced with watered-down wording welcoming an existing Commission initiative to “analyse investments from third countries in strategic sectors”.

But critics of the country’s trade and human rights policies fear Beijing has now found a way to the top able at the European Council where national leaders gather to make decisions.Matthias Machnig, German state secretary for economic affairs and a vocal proponent of EU-wide restrictions on Chinese takeovers, told Politico: “There are several countries that profited in the last months and years from Chinese direct investments.“And now the Chinese exerted pressure on these countries.”   Said Abdu, a member of the Swedish parliament’s business and trade committee for the Liberals party, said Swedish businesses he spoke to generally welcomed a push for investment screening. But money talks - especially in some of Europe’s more cash-strapped nations - and the potential loss of Chinese investment has become to big a risk. Over the last decade, the EU has become a top destination for Chinese investors, who have bought banks, ports, energy companies and high-tech manufacturers across the bloc, from the Greek peninsula to the outskirts of Dublin.Mr Abdu he said Sweden’s opposition in the Council “could be linked to the fact that Sweden’s two big carmakers, NEVS and Volvo, are owned by Chinese investors”.

    And a Western European trade official who did not attend the negotiations but was briefed on them said the critics of the screening proposal “threatened, or rather indicated, that if the plan went through they would have to be compensated financially” for the loss of investment they would have otherwise received.According to a senior Commission official the plans were softened “because of pressure from China” as Beijing has found a new way to exert leverage on the Continent.André Sapir, a senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank, told politico.eu: “There are new dividing lines in the Council that are not necessarily the traditional ones between Northern, liberal and Southern, protectionist countries.“Southern countries used to favour a harder line against China, but then came the crisis.”
