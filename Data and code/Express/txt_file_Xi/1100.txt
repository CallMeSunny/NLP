   A poll, conducted by Sydney based Lowy Institute for International Policy, revealed that the UK, after the Brexit vote, came considerably ahead of the US, India and China in terms of trust for a foreign nation.The data revealed that some Australians back Mrs May more than their own prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, when it comes to world affairs.The survey of 1,200 Australians fund that nine in 10 trusted the UK, while more than a third of those thought Mrs May is a trustworthy leader.But, belief in the US among Australians seems to have wained, with stats suggesting trust towards the US fell by 28 percent since 2011 – and by six percent over the last year.

Trust in India (59 percent) is ahead of the United States (55 percent), followed closely by China (52 percent). Just 28 percent trust Russia, and 8 percent trust North Korea."According to the think-tank, Britain also ranks highly on how "warmly" Australians feel about a range of nations and the European Union.

In the United States, Americans elected a president who is an unbeliever in alliances and hostile to free trade," he said."In Asia, China continues its inexorable rise, pursuing muscular policies in the South China Sea and recasting power relations throughout the region."  Australians seem to trust Theresa May more than their own Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull (Image: GETTY)However, Dr Fullilove said the "feelings thermometer" had shown the "Anglosphere maintains its grip on the Australian psyche" - suggesting that some of that appears to have an effect on how Australians view Mrs May."Only 30% of Australians have either 'a lot' or 'some' confidence in Donald Trump 'to do the right thing regarding world affairs'," the report says."This places Trump ahead of only Russia's Vladimir Putin (19 percent) and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (5%) among the nine leaders ranked."The leaders Australians regard with the most confidence are the UK's Theresa May (68 percent) and Japan's Shinzo Abe (66%)."Next is Malcolm Turnbull (63 percent), and France's Emmanuel Macron has the confidence of 61 percent. Eighteen points behind is China's Xi Jinping (43 percent), followed by India's Narendra Modi (37 percent).”
