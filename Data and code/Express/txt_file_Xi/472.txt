   Xi Jinping has allegedly fitted the outposts in the contested area with anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems.Greg Poling, an expert with specialist knowledge on the South China Sea, declared such a move from the Asian superstate would be an “implicit threat”.He explained: "These would be the first missiles in the Spratly Islands, either surface to air, or anti-ship."Before this, if you were one of the other claimants you knew that China was monitoring your every move.

    The YJ-12B anti-ship cruise missiles alleged to have been placed in the outposts are capable to striking vessels from 339 miles away.Meanwhile, the HQ-9B long-range surface-to-air missiles that China is understood to have placed in the South China Sea could hit planes, drone and cruise missiles within a 184 mile range.America’s Admiral Philip Davidson, the individual nominated to lead the US’ Pacific Command, stated last month that China’s “forward operating bases” seemed to be complete.He went on: "The only thing lacking are the deployed forces.”Admiral Davidson also issued a shocking warning that could cause World War 3 fears for the region to mount.He went on: "China will be able to extend its influence thousands of miles to the south and project power deep into Oceania."  GettyXi Jinping has allegedly fitted the outposts in the contested area with anti-ship cruise missilesThe Admiral insisted the bases “would easily overwhelm the military forces of any other South China Sea-claimants.”He added Xi Jinping’s military might in the region means the Asian superstate is able to control the contested region.Mr Davidson went on: "China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States.”  GettyChina has issued a shocking 'threat' to Taiwan  GettyGreg Poling declared such a move from the Asian superstate would be an 'implicit threat'An official from the Pentagon stated the US has “constantly called on China” to “refrain from further land reclamation” in the contested region in a desperate attempt to prevent conflict breaking out.They stated: "We have consistently called on China, as well as other claimants, to refrain from further land reclamation, construction of new facilities, and militarisation of disputed features, and to commit to managing and resolving disputes peacefully with other claimants."The further militarisation of outposts will only serve to raise tensions and create greater distrust among claimants."
