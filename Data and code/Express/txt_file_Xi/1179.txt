    But if the reports prove true, the carrier will join China’s first aircraft carrier, The Liaoning, which was bought from Ukraine in 1998 and refitted in China.The reports come after the former head of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) Sir Angus Houston said the biggest Pacific land and sea grabs since the Japanese invasions of 1930s and 1940s was almost complete on the artificial islands.Although Chinese President Xi Jinping has previously pledged not to “militarise” the disputed region, Beijing has pumped the area full of weapons.   US military officials claim Beijing has “hundreds” of surface-to-air missiles that will be moved to the disputed islands over coming months.Mr Houston said: “I have seen the imagery (and) what you see is infrastructure going in.“And it is not going to be too much longer before it is fully developed.“All of this development will enable China to dominate the South China Sea and extend its permanent military presence further south in proximity to Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.”  GETTYChina is known to be boosting its military power  REUTERSConstruction of The Shandong began in 2014In his first few days of entering the White House, President Donald Trump made it clear he was going to follow through on his signature election promises.Before entering the White House, Mr Trump promised to go after Beijing by imposing a 45 per cent tariff on Chinese goods.But he also suggested he’s not afraid of a military contest over Taiwan or the South China Sea.
