  GETTY Russia and China are working to stem the threat of war between the US and North Korea Ex-Russian ambassador Tony Brenton told Express.co.uk Vladimir Putin’s nation will speak with a single voice alongside old rival China to oppress America. Determined to keep a check on Donald Trump’s ambitions in their backyards, Mr Brenton said Russia would ”stay close” to Beijing in order to put pressure on America to back down against Kim Jong-un’s warmongering regime. Mr Brenton said: “We are a long way from a real resolution. “Russia certainly won’t want war between the US and North Korea. The Russians don’t like the fact North Korea acquired nuclear weapons.  Related articles   Obama's response to Charlottesville is now most liked tweet ever   Brussels ALREADY pulls plug on funding of UK tech    REUTERS North Korea has been warmongering and threatening to launch a missile in Guam “They will be keen to find a process to stop this position. They don’t want America to step in and throw the regime off and reignite a Korean War. “Russia and China both share a border with North Korea, it’s an unattractive prospect.“They will work together to get the temperature down by oppressing America.” Presidents Putin and Xi Jinping last month issued a joint statement in Moscow, where both called for a common peace plan for the peninsula and together condemned US militarisation in the region.  In pictures: The best place to escape Trump’s ‘fire and fury’ Fri, August 11, 2017Built in 1970s, Pyongyang Metro may soon become the best place for North Korean's to escape Donald Trump's 'fire and fury' like the world has never seen Play slideshow  Eric lafforgue/Exclusivepix medi1 of 15The Pyongyang subway

      GETTY China and Russia have grown closer in the face of war The potent democratic alliance is a far cry from the days when the two giants were once sworn communist rivals after a 1969 border conflict threatened to spark nuclear war between China and the then Soviet Union.But keen to reign in threats from the West and its allies, Moscow and Beijing have grown closer as they attempt to avoid the outbreak of World War Three. When quizzed over whose side Russia would take in the even of an all out war, Mr Brenton claimed the Kremlin would “stay out of it’”. He told Express.co.uk: “ I think the Chinese probably would as well.      GETTY Russia and China are calling for a peace settlement between the US and North Korea“But the worry is that this is an unpredictable situation. But even if China intervened I don’t think Russia would get involved." He added: “America must recognise North Korea as state, which it currently doesn’t, and abstain from big military interventions with South Korea.” Kim Jong-un has ordered his army to “be ready to strike at all times” after he received a report from his military chiefs on a plan to launch missiles towards the US territory of Guam.The despotic leader also warned President Trump the US should make “the right choice” to prevent a war.He claimed it would be the “most delightful historic moment” when the weapons “wring the windpipes of the Yankees and point daggers at their necks”, according to state media. However, there has been signs of easing in tension on the Korean peninsula as Kim said he will “watch the actions of the US a little bit more” after the US President promised “fire and fury” on the hermit kingdom if they threaten US citizens again.
