Lee Ji-sue, a North Korea expert, said Pyongyang has been forced to pull back in large part because of China its neighbor and ally.North Korean military official Choe Ryong Hae had met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing in late May.The close confidant of Kim Jong-un had said that Pyongyang was willing to launch dialogue with 'all relevant parties'.There are question marks on whether the agreement from North Korea is an effort to ease international demands on its development of its nuclear weapons.  Lee said it still remains to be seen whether North Korea's overtures are genuine. He added: "If North Korea starts accepting South Korean conditions one by one in future talks, we can then say it is really serious." Related articles   The softer side of North Korea?
