He, William and Kate are also expected to take part in a glittering state banquet at Buckingham Palace the night before, although in keeping with tradition, palace officials have not confirmed their attendance yet. For years, all three avoided taking part in the formalities when foreign heads of state came to London, preferring instead to focus on youth issues, their charity campaigns, and a more informal style of royal engagement.Aides excused their absences by suggesting that because William and Harry also had full time or part-time careers in the military, or the Air Ambulance latterly for William, there was no expectation that they would be needed by the Queen to support her on such trips.   But William and Kate, both 35, did meet US President Barack Obama albeit briefly and informally during his state visit to Britain just after their wedding in 2011. Two years later, William represented the Queen formally at a state visit for the first time by joining South Korea’s President Park Geun-hye at a ground-breaking ceremony for a Korean War memorial in London.

    And then in 2015 he and Kate attended their first state banquet - a much-anticipated opportunity for female fans to see her wearing a tiara - when China’s President Xi Jinping came on a state visit.Harry had been due to join William and Kate in helping to host a visit by King Felipe, 49, and his glamorous wife, Letiza, 44, in March 2016 but it was postponed because of a political crisis in Madrid. It was rescheduled for June this year but then had to be postponed again after Prime Minister Theresa May called a snap general election.
