  GETTYIllegal wildlife trade is currently valued at £13 billion a yearBesides exposing the activities of 25 crime gangs and arresting 376 suspects, the international investigation shows how racketeers are pillaging the planet’s natural heritage.Up to 100 elephants are dying every day to satisfy the illegal wildlife trade valued at £13 billion a year.Not only are elephants and rhinos falling to poachers’ bullets to make huge fortunes, many other creatures are also being destroyed in the name of profit. Up to 100 elephants are dying every day to satisfy the illegal wildlife tradeOperation Worthy II has seen thousands of wildlife items seized across Africa after 11 state law enforcement agencies came together to investigate the levels of nature crime across the continent and the way its tentacles are spreading across the Far East.Reviewing the 10-month investigation, Interpol has released details of the operation which led to:• 4.5 tonnes of elephant ivory seized;• 376 arrests and the investigation of 25 crime groups;• The seizure of 2,029 pangolin scales;• The confiscation of 173 live tortoises;• Big cat, pangolin, python and impala skins and carcasses seized;  GETTYAuthorities have managed to seize big cat skinsInvestigators also recovered 55 kilos of sea cucumber – a marine invertebrate prized as a delicacy – as well five firearms, two-home made rifles and 532 rounds of ammunition.Besides making vital seizures, the participating countries also issued 25 Interpol alerts. These included seven Red Notices for wanted persons and four Blue Notices for intelligence gathering on suspects.Francis Rwego, head of the Interpol regional bureau for East Africa in Nairobi, said: “Operation Worthy II was a very successful initiative for the countries involved, in particular the pre-operation meetings and workshops which provided officers with the necessary skills to carry out the operational phase effectively.“This operation could not have achieved such success without the on-the-ground actions by national law enforcement supported by Interpol’s global network.”The 11 countries taking part were Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. During the operation, investigators were deployed in Kenya and Tanzania as well Asian countries, including Singapore and Thailand, where several tonnes of elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn were seized.  GETTYElephants are targeted for their ivory tusksAfrica’s fight back against the racketeers getting rich on its “white gold” and rhino horn is being championed by the likes of Prince William, President Barack Obama and China’s Xi Jinping who have spoken out against the loss of the planet’s iconic wildlife.Yet for all the diplomatic and political will to smash the ivory racket, huge quantities of ivory are still being smuggled out of Africa almost daily.New figures show more than 32 tonnes of poached ivory have been seized this year, with at least 18 consignments in excess of 500 kilograms.In stark terms, the ivory seizures equate to a staggering death toll of 100 elephants killed every day.Numbers of the world’s largest land creature have crashed by 62 per cent over the last decade and as few as 400,000 remain in the wild.   “It is worth reflecting that since the first reported seizure of 2015, on the January 2, not a single week has passed without law enforcers confiscating illegal ivory,” said Kelvin Alie, Director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare’s Wildlife Trade Programme.“Over and above the large-scale seizures, one cannot ignore the innumerable smaller quantities of ivory seized.“In total, IFAW’s records show that 142 seizures of ivory were reported in the media during the course of 2015, with the majority of those taking place in South East Asia and Asia, in particular Thailand, Vietnam and China and in countries across Africa.”Alie says that between 25,000 and 50,000 elephants are dying each year for their ivory.Rhinos are suffering the same fate but the death toll for 2015 is being kept under wraps by the South African government whose country remains the great bastion of these rapidly vanishing animals. Up to August, poachers are thought to have killed 749 rhinos. Last year, 1,215 rhinos died for their horns, still prized as a cancer cure in the Far East.
