   The leaked documents were published by the Central Military Commission in February for the purpose of spreading President Xi Jinping’s “thought on strengthening the armed forces”.If the reforms go ahead, they will lead to heightened tensions with China’s neighbouring countries, including Japan, in the East and South China Seas and the US.The documents read: “As we open up and expand our national interests beyond borders, we desperately need a comprehensive protection of our own security around the globe.”The report adds a military expansion will allow China to “more effectively create a situation, manage a crisis, contain a conflict, win a war, defend the expansion of our country’s strategic interests in an all-round fashion and realise the goals set by the party and Chairman Xi”.

    A direct confrontation with the US is referred to as “a slower vehicle on a curve", which means it is in decline but it also claims the aim of the reforms is to surpass the American military might.The documents were leaked as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) navy launched two advanced warships designed for surface warfare, long-range air defence and anti-submarine operations, as the country's naval modernisation continues.In May, the United States raised concerns with China about its latest militarisation of the South China Sea and claimed there will be short-term and long-term consequences.   In the disputed South China Sea, China has built up its presence on the islands more than any other country in the area, installing air bases, radar systems, and defence capabilities.It has also emerged the country has been recently testing radar cross-sections (RCS) for new fighter jets.A RCS index can measure how detectable an object is by radar and can be used in ballistic missiles.
