      GETTYTrump was congratulated by the President of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, after his victoryProfessor Huang Jing, from the National University of Singapore, said: "This really sends a message that Donald Trump wants to handle China at the bilateral relationship level."Beijing's praise comes after the business tycoon breached political protocol by having the conversation with president Tsai Ing-wen, inflaming relations with the Chinese. Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into..— Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016The outspoken billionaire later tweeted: "The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!"The "one China" policy follows Beijing’s stance of not recognising special territories, including Taiwan, Hong Kong an Macau as independent but as part of China. But Mr Trump appeared irked by the speculation surrounding the call and the negative response from China, as he later tweeted: "Interesting how the US sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call."
