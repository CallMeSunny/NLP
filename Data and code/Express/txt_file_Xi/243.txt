Mr Trump said he was "more confident than ever that our options in addressing this threat are both effective and overwhelming”.The US President says he has not ruled out a military option in the crisis and the US Air Force flew four F-35B stealth fighter jets and two B-1B bombers over the Korean peninsula earlier today.North Korea, which carried out more missile tests last Friday, has bitterly denounced new sanctions on its economy as "vicious, unethical and inhumane" and warned the measures would only accelerate progress on its nuclear weapons programme.The UN Security Council last week imposed a new raft of sanctions on North Korea, slapping an export ban on textiles, freezing work permits to North Korean guest workers and placing a cap on oil supplies.

    Pyongyang says it needs nuclear weapons to protect itself from US forces and is determined to build a weapons system capable of delivering a nuclear warhead capable of hitting the American mainland.A foreign ministry statement said the sanctions were an "act of hostility to physically exterminate the people of" North Korea.The statement said: “The increased moves of the US and its vassal forces to impose sanctions and pressure on North Korea will only increase our pace towards the ultimate completion of the state nuclear force.”
