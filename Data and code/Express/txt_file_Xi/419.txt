    General Keane said: “We’re rapidly and dangerously heading towards the reality that the military option is the only one left when it comes to getting North Korea to denuclearise and not weaponised [intercontinental ballistic missiles].“But the Trump administration cannot accept a nuclear launch.“We cannot rely on our missile-defence system to defeat it and expose the American people to a nuclear attack.“Therefore if an ICBM attack was imminent the President would have to conduct a preemptive strike.”The Chinese leader Xi Jinping is set to meet President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida later today.On the agenda, the two leaders are expected to discuss the growing threat from Pyongyang.   General Keane insisted that Trump has no intention to fail in “solving” North Korea.He added: “Three past presidents have sought political, economic and diplomatic steps to get North Korea to de-nuclearise but failed miserably. All three tried to leverage China but also failed.”  GETTYSouth Korea have been preparing their military for an attackYesterday, North Korean officials warned that Kim Jong-un will take “counteraction” steps against President Trump if he attempts to "deal" with the communist state.Military chiefs from the hermit state said Trump’s “reckless actions” is pushing Kim Jong-un “to the brink of war”.
