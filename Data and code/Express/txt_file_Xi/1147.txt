    "If China and the United States do that together, it won't be without consequence.”The recent exchange of insults and threats between North Korea and Mr Trump prompted the German Chancellor to declare that "escalating the rhetoric is the wrong answer" in a dig apparently aimed at the US President. Instead of threats and ultimatums, Mrs Merkel called for the North Korea crisis to be resolved through diplomacy as Mr Trump once again used social media to take aim at Kim Jong-un.  AFPThe international community still appears to be without a solution to the ongoing North Korea crisisShe said: "I believe that an escalation of rhetoric will not contribute to a solution of this conflict."I do not see a military solution to this conflict rather I see continuous work like we saw in the UN Security Council with members with resolutions in view of North Korea."But escalation of rhetoric I hold as the wrong answer."
