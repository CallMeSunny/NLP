   Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson declared that the voyage from the Sutherland would demonstrate the UK’s freedom and navigation prowess.He declared: "She'll be sailing through the South China Sea and making it clear our Navy has a right to do that.”The mighty ship will travel through the heart of the Asian superpower’s water when it travels home from Australia.Xi Jinping has made a claim to nearly all of the waters in the area despite contentions from Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam that contest China.

    He continued: “Of course, China also needs to construct necessary defence equipment for its territory. The relevant equipment is not directed at any particular country."China was enraged last year when a US warship came close to a reef in the South China Sea.A foreign ministry spokesman declared at the time that the vessel “undermines China's sovereignty and security interests”.   Mr Kang declared that China urged “the US to correct this mistake” and declared that it was “warned” to leave.US vessels have come as close as 12 miles to disputed territory claimed by the Asian superstate - a distance that is seen as the territorial limit in the area.Although Mr Williamson did not specify if HMS Sutherland would get closer than 12 miles, he said that he supported the US methods in the South China Sea.

GettyBoris Johnson has previously declared an enthusiasm to send vessels to the watersDespite the assertive attitude from the UK, regional defence expert Richard Bitzinger believes the nothing will change from HMS Sutherland’s trip.He explained: "It’s all huff-and-puff, and everything stays the same."The fact of the matter is, China has created a fait accompli with these islands. The South China Sea is part of its strategic national interests, and hence Chinese presence in the South China Sea is permanent and perhaps becoming hegemonic. And there is very little anyone can do about it."
