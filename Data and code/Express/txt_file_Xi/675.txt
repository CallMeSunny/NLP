    As an over performing employment sector could encourage the Federal Reserve to reconsider its plans to increase interest rates just twice more in 2017, the ADP number helped counter the impact of the day’s disappointing services figures. However, economists are currently expecting a change in non-farm payrolls of 177k on Friday, significantly less than February’s 235k. This result would leave the US unemployment rate at 4.7 per cent and could put the US dollar under pressure before the weekend.
