    Earlier today North Korea’s state media agency KCNA, accused Donald Trump of being responsible for  the escalating tensions between the two countries.They said he had raised tensions “to the extremes,” before adding that “no-one can predict when the lunatic old man of the White House, lost to sense, will start a nuclear war”.KCNA said: "The world is undergoing unprecedented throes because of Trump, a notorious 'political heretic'.   "The US must oust the lunatic old man from power and withdraw the hostile policy towards the DPRK at once in order to get rid of the abyss of doom.“The US had better make a decisive choice… if it does not want a horrible nuclear disaster and tragic doom."Mr Trump hit back at the remarks in a bizarre tweet in which he said: ““Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me "old," when I would NEVER call him "short and fat?" Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!”  GETTYNorth Korea has been testing its nuclear capability  GETTYPresident Trump is currently in Vietnam, just 2000 miles from North KoreaMr Trump was in China earlier this week and asked President Xi Jinping to intervene and help de-escalate North Korea’s military rhetoric.He said: “China can fix this problem easily and quickly and I am calling on China and your great president to hopefully work on it very hard.“If he works on it hard, it will happen, there's no doubt about it.”
