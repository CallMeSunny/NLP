  GETTYPrince William was hailed for making progress with China in the effort to stop illegal animal tradeThe campaigning royal is now expected to announce a breakthrough in efforts to shutdown the shadowy network that allows plundered rhino horn and ivory to be shipped from Africa to the Far East in coming weeks. Lord Hague praised the prince prior to a Chinese delegation arriving in London for talks about the wildlife trade crisis that is pushing some of the planet’s iconic creatures to the brink.Lord Hague is chairing a meeting today between William’s United for Wildlife task force and Chinese officials and says the prince’s global influence had proven decisive.  GETTYChina is making "significant" progress to curb the trade The fact that China is attending is an important step forwardLord HagueWilliam set up the wildlife umbrella group in 2013 to help tackle the global challenge and this year has focused efforts on helping to stamp out demand for ivory and rhino horn in China, the world's biggest market for the animal parts.In October he met Chinese president Xi Jinping to discuss solutions to the problem of wildlife crime and later appeared on a Chinese current affairs programme to talk about curbing demand for ivory and call on the country to become a global leader in wildlife protection.“The Duke - and of course Prince Harry too - are passionate about this because of their knowledge of Africa. I hope it will be quite a significant meeting. The fact that China is attending is an important step forward,” said Lord Hague before the talks.“The real answer, the ultimate answer, is to remove the demand. Since the Duke’s visit a year ago to China, they have taken a lot of significant steps. One of them is they are going to send officials to our meeting, which is a big change from their point of view.     GETTYIvory demand is dwindling in China seen through the significant price drop“They have made a commitment now to phase out the legal market for ivory, they have been taking stricter measures on transportation of illegal wildlife, they have destroyed a stock of ivory which sends a signal that they are determined it will have no value.“They have announced strong penalties now for people convicted of smuggling so I think over the last year there has been a very, very welcome and clear direction from the Chinese government and we are looking to encourage that.”The falling price of black market ivory in China is an indication that demand is dwindling. Prior to the summit hosted by Prince William and the Prince of Wales three years ago, wholesale ivory cost £1,400 per kilogram.It has now dropped to £730 a kilogram.
