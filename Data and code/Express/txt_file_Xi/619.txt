   Frederick Kempe is adamant Brussels and the US should form a trade alliance to challenge China’s economic might. Italy is set to become the first major EU member country to sign a bilateral agreement on cooperation with China despite Beijing’s controversial Belt and Road Initiative to increase Chinese global infrastructure. But Mr Kempe warned cross-Atlantic cooperation on dealing with Beijing appears a long way off, with Mr Trump eyeing the EU as a trade rival.
