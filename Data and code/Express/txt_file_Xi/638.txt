Fresh from the meeting of world leaders at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Donald Trump tweeted that China had agreed to cut import tariffs on American-made cars. The US President said on Twitter: "China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the US. Currently the tariff is 40 percent.” The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was up by 1.62 percent to 75.9100 at around 09:45 GMT, as carmakers remained at the forefront of gains.

The move would bolster US carmakers who were hit hard when China ramped up levies on US-made cars in July as part of a broad package of retaliatory tariffs amid the sprawling trade war between Washington and Beijing.Wang Cun, director of the China Automobile Dealers Association's import committee, told reporters in Beijing: "If they cancel the extra 25 percent tariff on US-made cars, then we will see positive signs for imported cars.”US President Donald Trump imposed a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion (£153 billion) worth of Chinese goods in September.The US simultaneously threatened to add tariffs to a further $267 billion (£205 billion) of products.This saw China retaliate with 10 percent tariffs on $60 billion (£46 billion) of US imports.The tariffs stem from the Trump administration's demands that China make sweeping changes to its intellectual property practices.The US also wants Beijing to rein in high-technology industrial subsidies, open its markets to more foreign competition and take steps to cut a $375 billion (£283 billion) US goods trade surplus.
