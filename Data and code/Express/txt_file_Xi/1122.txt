It needs to be a slower progression.“I think women need to prove themselves in a combat role first. They can join the Royal Marines and Parachute Regiment and prove themselves in both of those. These are important stepping stones towards special forces selection.” His comments follow reports that the SAS is considering making its gruelling selection exercises easier for women, who could be allowed to carry lighter loads and given more time for treks to give them a better chance of passing one of the toughest tests in the world.   INSTAGRAMAnt believes women should first prove themselves in the Royal Marines or Parachute RegimentLess than 10 per cent of all candidates make it through the trials, which include a 40-mile, 20-hour march in the Brecon Beacons, South Wales, jungle exercises in Belize and interrogation tests. In 2013 three SAS reservists died during a training exercise in Brecon. Portsmouth-born Ant served with the Royal Marines and the Paras before, in 2008, joining the Special Boat Service, the UK’s naval special forces unit and the sister unit of the SAS.He left the military in 2012 and started work as a personal security guard protecting VIPs.  Mystery as Russian army DESTROYS ghost town Thu, January 4, 2018Image stills taken from an extraordinary video shows Vladimir Putin’s army destroying a ghost garrison town Play slideshow  MOD/The Siberian Times1 of 9The old military buildings dated from Soviet times
