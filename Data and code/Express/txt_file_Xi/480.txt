  GETTYClinton has called on China to take a more 'outfront' role in enforcing sanctionsThe former US presidential candidate also called on China to take a "more outfront role" in enforcing sanctions against North Korea aimed at curbing its missile and nuclear development.Mrs Clinton told the World Knowledge Forum in the South Korean capital of Seoul: "There is no need for us to be bellicose and aggressive (over North Korea)."Tension between Pyongyang and Washington has soared following a series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Mrs Clinton said, without mentioning Mr Trump by name: "Picking fights with Kim Jong Un puts a smile on his face."

    On Tuesday, Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan said the United States did not rule out the eventual possibility of direct talks with North Korea.The situation on the Korean peninsula was now touch-and-go point "and a nuclear war may break out any moment", North Korea's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Kim In Ryong had told a U.N. General Assembly committee on Monday.In Seoul, the vice foreign minister said on Wednesday South Korea was considering levying its own sanctions on the North, although no decision has been made yet.Ms Clinton, a former US secretary of state, said Washington's allies have increasingly been expressing concern over the reliability of the United States, advising Washington to avoid becoming distracted with North Korean threats and be "as forcefully patient" as possible.Regarding China's role in reining in North Korea, Ms Clinton said Beijing would be better off trying to "tighten and absolutely enforce sanctions" against North Korea.North Korea's relationship with its main ally and trading partner China have been strained by its rapid pursuit of weapons programmes, with many of Pyongyang's recent tests coinciding with major Chinese events.There had been fears that North Korea would conduct another test to coincide with the start of China's five-yearly party congress on Wednesday. Instead, Pyongyang sent Beijing a congratulatory message.   The central committee of the North's ruling Workers' Party of Korea said China had made "great progress in accomplishing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics" under the guidance of the Communist Party of China.The party central committee said in the message carried by the official KCNA news agency: "We are greatly pleased over this."It added that it "sincerely wished" the China congress "satisfactory success"Chinese President Xi Jinping did not mention North Korea in his more than three-hour-long address at the opening of a key Communist Party Congress.
