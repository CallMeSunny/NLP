    var brightcoveBrandsafety='' The CEO of the Carlton James Group told Express.co.uk the escalating US-China trade war will inevitably "pull" the UK in the middle as Britain prepares to freely trade with the rest of the world post-Brexit. Mr Calton warned the message from American President Donald Trump has already reached our shores loud and clear urging the UK to be "very careful" about future relationships around the globe. He said: “Without a doubt, we are going to be pulled into that trade war. At the moment we are part of the European Union with about 500 million people. We’re moving over to start trading with a country of 60 million.

That could be very dangerous," he said."We have already seen a negative effect of forecasts for global growth largely caused by trade tensions between China and the US, so this is a worry."A full-blown trade war would have a very serious dampening effect on the whole global economy, including the UK, but I think we are a way away from that yet and I hope that this will be resolved."    var brightcoveBrandsafety='4 Sport and specialist news &ndash; passed for ad targeting' He added: "I am optimistic that in the end there will be a trade deal between China and the US."That is very important for us in the UK because our economy is a very open economy so it is very exposed to what is happening elsewhere in the world."Downing Street also expressed concern about the prospects of an escalation of the dispute."We are clear that nobody benefits from trade wars," a No 10 spokeswoman said."Discussions between the two are ongoing and we hope they will find a resolution to avoid any further escalation."The spat erupted as US and Chinese negotiators were due to begin further talks in Washington aimed at resolving a dispute which has rocked financial markets and disrupted world trade.The latest increase extends 25% US duties to a total of 250 billion dollars (£192 billion) of Chinese imports.Beijing retaliated for previous tariff hikes by raising duties on 110 billion US dollars (£85 billion) of American imports.
