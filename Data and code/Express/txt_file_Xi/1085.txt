Just last month, the US imposed a further 25 percent taxes on $16 billion worth of goods from China, in its second wave of tariffs against the Asian superpower.The latest escalation in the US-China trade war came after China cancelled further trade talks with Washington.Eswar Prasad, former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division told the Washington Post: "The end game in the U.S.-China trade war has now become even more difficult to discern as both sides step up their attacks and counter-attacks."Trump’s remarks confirm his intention to continue escalating trade sanctions until China capitulates, and China has equally clearly signalled it has no intention of doing so."
