   President Donald Trump's missile strike on Syria on Friday is said to have also been a warning to North Korea as tensions between the two nations.A North Korean foreign military official told Pyongyang mouthpiece Korean Central News Agency: “Some forces are loud-mouthed that the recent US military attack on Syria is an action of warning us but we are not frightened by it.”Yesterday, a former head of MI6, Sir John Sawyers, warned that US President Donald Trump would be more likely to start a war with Kim Jong-un than Syria despite the recent missile strike on the nation.
