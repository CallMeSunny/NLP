     The status quo in North Korea is unacceptableDonald TrumpTrump has declared now is the time to take action as he met with the United Nations Security Council on Monday.The US President said: “The status quo in North Korea is unacceptable. The council must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programs.”   It follows comments by the secretive states defence chief who warned Mr Trump that “nuclear weapons capable of striking the US” have been deployed.The latest inflammatory remarks come as Mr Trump held conversations with the Chinese president Xi Jinping and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, aimed at stopping the nuclear ambitions of the North.  GETTYThe submarine is one of the largest in the US NavyA South Korean military official said: "The nuclear-powered submarine USS Michigan will enter the waters off the peninsula soon or later to jointly conduct drills with the USS Carl Vinson.”An editorial in the China Daily said: “Judging from their recent words and deeds, policymakers in Pyongyang have seriously misread the UN sanctions, which are aimed at its nuclear/missile provocations, not its system or leadership.  GETTYKim Jong-un held a military parade to showcase the army and missiles “They are at once perilously overestimating their own strength and underestimating the hazards they are brewing for themselves.The Pentagon said the submarine's visit was part of a “regularly scheduled deployment to the Western Pacific.”The USS Michigan is one of four US Navy subs that began service as a ballistic missile submarine, loaded with nuclear missiles as part of the US strategic nuclear deterrent.
