   Fears are growing Mr Trump will challenge China over the Spratly Islands.At a press conference in Beijing on Tuesday, the foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, urged the White House to “speak and act cautiously”.Mr Hua was responding to comments made by White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, the previous day.Mr Spicer told reporters the US would “make sure that we protect our interests” in the resource-rich trade route, through which $4.5tn (£3.4tn) in trade passes each year. World leaders will undoubtedly be watching the tense talks unfold just days after Mr Trump’s inauguration.The controversial billionaire businessman - now leader of the free world - has made little of who he will form allegiances with.

    Mr Spicer said he was not clear on what action could be taken by the US.He said: “I think, as we develop further, we’ll have more information on it.” Mr Trump may ramp up US troops in the South China Sea after meeting with his advisors.Daniel Blumenthal, director of Asian Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington-based thinktank, told the Guardian: “We’ve talked a big game on security but haven’t really followed it up all that well with the military muscle that was needed.”Blumenthal said a “strong, persistent US naval presence” was required to back up a foreign policy “that at its bottom line says that China’s not going to control the South China Sea … But you can’t do that without military resources.”China has previously been accused of militarising the islands - claims which it denies.
