   US Vice President Mike Pence raised the stakes in the ongoing dispute between the two countries when he delivered a sabre-rattling speech accusing Beijing of cyber warfare, interfering with US democracy and endangering the lives of US servicemen with reckless military actions in the South China Sea.China angrily dismissed Mr Pence’s allegations and accused him of “creating something out of thin air”, but analysts fear the speech could signal an escalation in US hostility against Beijing.Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said: “These are unwarranted accusations against China's domestic and foreign policies and they slandered China by claiming that China meddles in US internal affairs and elections."This is nothing but speaking on hearsay evidence, confusing right and wrong and creating something out of thin air. The Chinese side is firmly opposed to it.” Related articles   China is meddling in US democracy!
