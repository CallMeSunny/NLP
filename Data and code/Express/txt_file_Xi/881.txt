   On Sunday, Mr Salvini boasted that the EU will finally be changed for good following the European Parliament elections in May. This comes amid a wave of attacks from Italian politicians on the behaviour of the EU leadership. Claudio Borghi, chairman of the lower house budget committee, suggested that Italy should leave the bloc unless there is a decisive shift toward populist parties in May's elections.

However, Mr Salvini later played down such claims, adding that Italy wanted to “change and improve Europe, not abandon it”.His latest remarks are conflicting to a throwback speech he gave in 2016, during which he ferociously criticised the bloc and called for it to "die as soon as possible".The speech came after Chinese President Xi Jinping met European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude in Bejing for talks regarding whether the EU should recognise China as a market economy.The issue had become a flashpoint in Brussels as a sluggish EU economy, excess Chinese production capacity and a struggling European steel industry was sparking fears of a manufacturing decline and further job losses from the UK to Italy.

Go work in China."But first, step in front of a European factory that will close if this agreement goes ahead."I hope this Europe will die as soon as possible and another more serious, freer and more modern one comes in the shortest time possible."In May 2016, a large majority of MEPs voted against granting China the status of "market economy", pre-empting the proposal being prepared by the European Commission.
