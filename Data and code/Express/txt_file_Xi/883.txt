   Angela Merkel’s economy minister, Peter Altmaier, has said he is worried Donald Trump’s “America First” policy will negatively impact the EU. Washington DC and Beijing have both hit one another with large tariffs on imports in recent months. Trump has insisted the measures are needed to protect the US economy until the two countries renegotiate their current trade agreement.
