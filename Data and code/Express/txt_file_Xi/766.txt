     This is something that has been festering for decades, facilitated by the Clinton Administration and made even worse under ObamaSebastian GorkaMr Trump attacked the regime of despot leader Kim Jong-un and called on "all responsible nations" to unite to halt the nuclear threat from the rogue state.The US President warned North Korea against making a "fatal miscalculation" as fears of World War 3 continue to soar.Mr Trump is expected to use his two-day visit to Bejing to convince President Xi Jinping to lend his support in restraining North Korea, a close ally to China.Experts fear Kim could make his biggest statement yet by firing the so-called “Juche bird” – a fearful H-bomb – during Mr Trump’s visit to Asia.
