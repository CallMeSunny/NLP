   The escalating trade war between the two most powerful economies in the world could have devastating consequences for global markets.However, Federico Rampini, economy expert and journalist at Italian daily Repubblica, said the US President was “right” in his decision to attack Beijing with tariffs on exports.Mr Rampini said: “China has been practising intellectual property theft in a systematic way for years.“Beijing also rules that companies coming from Western countries must choose a local partner if they want to work in China and transfer their technological knowledge to them.“And it applies export duties that are as high as ten times more than the one applied by its Western partners.”  Related articles   EUROZONE WARNING: US policies could spark crisis for EU growth   Trade WAR: EU 'not innocent' after Merkel and Macron’s meetings  Europe, it is time to decide where you stand on this trade disputeFederico Rampini, economy expert and journalistThe trade expert believes China is playing according to rules that are no longer fair, due to their establishment in the early 2000s when economic powers were debating over allowing it to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO).Mr Rampini said: “Then the Chinese economy was extremely poor.“But today China uses those same rules even though it became a superpower, incredibly prepared even in the most advanced tech sectors.”He added that there is the need to “discuss the entire structure of globalisation” to make it less unfair, and “the EU should be there to do it”.Mr Rampini also said: “Europe, it is time to decide where you stand on this trade dispute.”   GETTYUS trade war: China is playing according to unfair rules, an expert saidMr Trump pledged to level the playing field between America and China during his 2016 presidential campaign and in March this year he announced the first measures going in that direction, issuing aluminium and steel tariffs to protect American industries.His administration’s decision sparked an immediate answer from China, which placed fees on a wide range of US products.Mr Rampini said: “Xi Jinping thought to impress Trump with retaliative duties that could inflict the maximum damage to those US areas who historically vote for Republicans such as the Midwest.“But Trump reacted by doubling down, threatening to apply another $100 billion in tariffs, to add up to the already announce $50 million.”Yesterday Mr Trump announced he sent diplomats on a two-day visit to work out a solution on the divergences between China and the US and avoid a trade war.   GETTYUS trade war: Donald Trump was 'right' in his decision to attack China's exportsThe negotiators are likely to seek an agreement on short-term measures on the Chinese market to delay the imposition of tariffs on Beijing’s exports.He wrote on Twitter: “Our great financial team is in China trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade!“I look forward to being with President Xi in the not too distant future.“We will always have a good (great) relationship!”
