   Speaking at a conference organised by the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper The Global Times, Senior Colonel Dai Xu discussed the forceful reunification of China and Taiwan in light of the heightened tensions in the South China Sea. Mr Dai, who serves as the president of the country's Marine Institute for Security and Cooperation, urged the military to ramp up its aggression towards the US in the dispute waters, and suggested some provocation might push China towards military action targeting Taiwan. The Chinese General said: "Why do we put the battlefield in the South China Sea and Taiwan?
