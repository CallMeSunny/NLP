We do think they could do more with the oil.  Related articles   Trump calls on China after latest North Korean missile launch   North Korea brings 'world CLOSER to WAR not farther from it' US says   GETTYRex Tillerson wants China's help in quelling the North Korean threats“We're really asking them to please restrain more of the oil, not cut it off completely.“That was the most effective tool the last time the North Koreans came to the table.”It comes after Washington’s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, called on the international community to sever all ties with North Korea.She said US President Donald Trump had called Chinese President Xi Jinping and urged him to "cut off the oil” from North Korea.

    The UN Security Council has also banned members from hiring workers from North Korea and capped oil exports, in particular from China, Pyongyang's main trading partner.Russia branded the most recent missile launch "provocative" and Beijing expressed "grave concern and opposition."China again called for peace in the region and proposed North Korea stop its missile and nuclear tests in return for a freeze of US military exercises - which was rebuked by Washington.Earlier this month, Beijing called on South Korea to “take a responsible attitude” towards the use of its high-tech THAAD missile defence system.A flurry of missile tests from North Korea this year have raised the likelihood of South Korea using the US-built Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile system – something China has vehemently opposed.  AFPPresident Trump and President Xi have regularly spoken of their great relationshipThe installation of the THAAD system has angered China for years and the dispute has even spilled over into trade, hurting South Korean business interests in the country.China believed the system's powerful radar could be used to look inside its territory. South Korea and the US have repeatedly said THAAD only serves to defend against the growing missile threat from North Korea.
