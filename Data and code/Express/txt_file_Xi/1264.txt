Many countries were willing to talk about trade arrangements with the UKTheresa MayA number of discussion were held around potential trade deals, and it was confirmed that an Australian representative would visit the UK this week to begin negotiations.Mrs May said: "What I found pleasing and very useful in the discussions I had, particularly in bilaterals with a number of world leaders, is the willingness to talk to us about opening up trade arrangements between the United Kingdom and a number of other countries."   She also confirmed that the UK would not be adopting a points based immigration system, saying that it would not give Britain the level of border control it needs despite being a key pledge of the Leave campaign.At times the Prime Minster’s decisive words were overshadowed by a series of threats from world leaders.Outgoing President Barack Obama caused anger by suggesting that Britain would remain at “the back of the queue” for a US trade deal, with the American Government instead choosing to focus on its doomed TTIP negotiations.

    "And if you think about it, the single biggest vote of confidence in the UK in terms of inward investment since the referendum was from a Japanese company, from Softbank and its £24 billion proposal to buy ARM." Dr Kyris said: “The lack of any concrete Brexit plan so far and Mrs May's ambiguity on the matter allowed other states, especially the US and Japan, to set the agenda and dominate headlines.“Japan's extraordinary public warning shows that post-referendum era will be nothing but smooth.”Mrs May also met with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss the controversial Hinkley Point nuclear power station, and confirmed that she would made a decision later this month amid concerns over China’s involvement.
