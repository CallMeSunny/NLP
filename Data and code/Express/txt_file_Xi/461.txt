    A South Korean government official told Reuters there was no indication of a direct link between the expulsions and tension over the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system. But with THAAD capable of reaching Chinese territory, some believe Beijing is taking action against Seoul. South Korean companies have reported business has been halted with construction projects suspended and performances by South Korean artists cancelled.
