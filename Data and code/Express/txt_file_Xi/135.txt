Both the US and China have imposed more and more tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other’s goods over the last year and America has signalled it is prepared to increase duties to 25 percent from 10 percent if a deal can not be reached. Talks between US and Chinese representatives in Beijing are believed to be progressing well as the two countries try to hammer out a last minute deal to end the tit-for-tat tariff battle.

Mrs Sanders said: “We'll see what happens on whether or not the president makes a move to change the deadline.“It will ultimately take ... President Trump and President Xi sitting down face-to-face figuring that out and getting that final deal because they are the only two that will ultimately be able to nail that down.”Businesses in both countries fear being hit by the significant extra costs in sectors ranging from consumer electronics to agriculture.US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters in the Chinese capital that talks were going well.
