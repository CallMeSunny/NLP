GETTYChina's middle-class is richer than everAnd no project is deemed worthless.Last year, when the Financial Times asked a WMP saleswoman at an investment bank where their money would be going, the salesperson is reported to have replied: “I think it’s a bridge in Nanjing.”Conducted outside the normal banking system, lending like this is at the heart of China’s massive shadow banking industry.For China’s rulers, the fear is that there may be more bad loans in the shadows of the financial system. The danger is that a big default or series of loan losses could devastate the world’s second-biggest economy, leading to a sudden halt in bank lending.  GETTYChina's stock market is high risk Hidden, complex, sudden, contagious and hazardousGovernor Zhou Xiaochuan on shadow debtBut customers remain willing with enthusiasm for WMPs based on the belief that China’s economic growth will go on forever, and the huge misconception that because these investments are usually bought at major banks, the Chinese government itself is actually backing these investments.Beijing has acknowledged that the colossal volume of complex and potentially risky lending obscured in shadow banking compounds the threat posed by the economy’s tremendous accumulation of debt since the global financial crisis.The most infamous WMP, The Chang’an Trust product was one of countless so-called wealth management products sold to investors to help raise money for a massive wave of lending in China that began in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis.The Reuters investigation shows how the trust’s widely publicised default burnt China’s middle-class savers who are unlikely to get their money back. In a written response, Chang’an told the agency: “This case is currently being processed by the courts. Please wait for the judgment.”   So far there have been relatively few defaults like the Chang’an product. Some regional banks have been restructured after a spike in shadow loan failures.WMP financial risk poses a formidable challenge to the ruling Communist Party, and at a top level conference in July, party leader Xi Jinping declared that financial security was vital to national security.Alarm bells are now sounding at home and abroad over China’s astonishing debt levels.Zhou Xiaochuan, the People’s Bank of China, warned that authorities need to curb financial risks that might lead to a sudden collapse of asset prices, sparked by debt or currency pressures, after a long period of growth.Zhou said corporate debt levels were relatively high and household debt was rising fast, in remarks in October on the sidelines of the Communist Party’s 19th congress in Beijing: “We should focus on preventing a dramatic adjustment,” he said.  GETTYWhere old meets new in ChinaEarlier this year, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded China’s sovereign rating, citing concerns over the nation’s rising debt.Moody’s said in a recent report that China’s shadow banking assets grew more than 20 per cent in 2016 to 64 trillion yuan ($9.8 trillion), equivalent to 86.5 per cent of China’s gross domestic product. Other analysts claim the shadow debt pot to be worth 122.8 trillion yuan or $18.5 trillion.Commentators often say that in the event of widespread defaults, the government would be forced to bail out investors because so many are middle and high-income earners. Many investors also believe the Chinese banks would guarantee these products even though there may be no contractual obligation to do so.Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research and author of ‘Shadow Banking and the Rise of Capitalism in China’, told Reuters: “This is a kind of untested assumption.”According to Moody’s Investors Service last November, for the first time since 2012, China’s gross domestic product grew faster than shadow banking assets in the previous six-month period however in an article on the People’s Bank of China’s website following the news, Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said that the risks remain, “hidden, complex, sudden, contagious and hazardous.”
