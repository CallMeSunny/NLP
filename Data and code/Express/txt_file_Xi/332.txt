  GETTYPrince Charles is still to visit mainland ChinaCharles, who is an ardent supporter of Tibet's exiled leader the Dalai Lama, has endured a difficult relationship with China's Communist leaders.He boycotted a banquet during a 1999 State Visit to Britain by the country's then president, Jiang Zemin, in protest at his troops' occupation of Tibet. He was also absent the last time a Chinese leader, President Hu Jintao, came on a State Visit in 2005.A Clarence House spokeswoman today said it was unclear whether the Prince would be in Britain during the Chinese leader's State Visit in October or whether he and the Duchess of Cornwall would be able to attend events surrounding the visit. "It's too early to say," she said.In the Queen's Speech in Parliament today, the 89-year-old monarch confirmed the visit. Â She also confirmed that she and the Duke of Edinburgh planned to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta in November. During their trip, the royal couple will, as is customary, make a State Visit to Malta, where they lived as a young married Naval couple.

He hardly endeared himself to the Communist authorities by describing their ageing leaders as "appalling old waxworks" in a diary, leaked at around the same time in 2005, from his 1997 trip to Hong Kong for the handover of the former British colony to the Chinese.
