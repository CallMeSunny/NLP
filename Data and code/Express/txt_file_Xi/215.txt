   The revelation was made by the South China Morning Post, based on information from within the UK’s Department for International Trade. According to the leak, a UK company, which hasn’t been identified, has been granted an Open Individual Export Licence (OIEL), allowing it to trade in restricted goods. OIELs usually last between five and two years, although the figure in this case is unknown.
