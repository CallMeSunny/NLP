    Joseph S Bermudez Jr and Jack Liu from North Korea think tank 38 North which monitors the hermit kingdom, said: “Over the past four weeks, there have been unusually high levels of activity at the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site, especially around the North Portal—the tunnel in which the four most recent nuclear tests have taken place. Journalists visiting North Korea have have been told to prepare for a "big and important event" on Thursday as Pyongyang marks the 105th birth anniversary of its founding president Kim Il Sung on April 15, North Korea's biggest national day called "Day of the Sun”.  GETTYTensions between North Korea and the US are at risk of boiling overNorth Korea often marks important anniversaries with military parades and tests of its nuclear or missile capabilities.The increased movement comes as tensions with the US threaten to spill over with a US Navy strike group heading towards the Korean peninsula. Sydney-based security expert Euan Graham, of the Lowy Institute for International Policy, told 9news.au the reported preparations for a test are consistent with North Korea's strategy of "going nuclear and going early".He said: "I'm not surprised about this reported move. It is consistent with their plan of early escalation. But it's important to realise the North Koreans have become very sophisticated in knowing what commercial satellites can view and report.""It is possible that they are yanking our chains. There is no guarantee it will lead to a test."
