    Until recently, only the US and Japan had stealth fighters in Asia, giving the a significant advantage over Premier Xi Jinping’s forces in any military confrontation.Last year the Chinese leader unveiled the country’s new artificial intelligence strategy, which outlined plans to become a military world leader by 2050.It spoke of the needs for a “modernisation of the national defence and armed forces” to compete with the US.   It went on to say: “The people’s armed forces will be transformed into world-class military by the mid-21st century.”The introduction of the new J-20 jets is the latest attempt from China to reach their aim of becoming the most powerful military force in the world.Last year Eric Schmidt, the head of Google’s parent company Alphabet, made a stark warning that Beijing would be dominating in artificial intelligence on  the world stage within just over 10 years.
