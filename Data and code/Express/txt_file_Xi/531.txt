    Pyongyang has undertaken an unprecedented missile testing programme in recent months, as well as its biggest nuclear test yet in early September, as it seeks to develop a powerful nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States. North Korea's actions have angered China, its only major ally, and drawn further tough sanctions from the United Nations and the United States. North Korea further angered the Chinese government after it ignored warnings about the safety of the country’s main testing facility in Punggye-ri.The North Korean site suffered a major collapse, killing hundreds and putting the entire region at risk due to possible clouds of radioactive fallout.It comes as US President Donald Trump prepares to kickstart his first tour of Asia to mark his first year in office.
