   It comes as tensions remain high between the US, China and North Korea over Kim Jong-un’s nuclear weapons programme and repeated missile tests.Chinese President Xi Jinping has sent his head of international liaison, Song Tao, to meet their rogue ally at the end of this week.The Kim Jong-un mouthpiece Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said: ”Song Tao, head of the International Liaison Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, will soon visit the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a special envoy of Xi Jinping.”It was confirmed by China’s state media, which later announced Mr Song will visit on Friday.  GETTYChina will send a 'special envoy' to North Korea this week following Donald Trump’s Asia tourIt is unclear what the Chinese envoy’s agenda will be in North Korea as China is said to be growing impatient with the Kim Jong-un regime and the US President’s “warmongering”.But the move follows a Trump visit to China last week where the firebrand Republican declared the two nation’s “can solve almost all of the world's problems and probably all of them”.The US President said: “There can be no more important subject than China-US relations."I look forward to many years of success and friendship.

    "I believe we can solve almost all of the world's problems and probably all of them.”The Chinese leader also stated that his nation and the US have “have made important progress this year” and declared he believes “there is a solution to that” with regard to diffusing threats imposed by North Korea.But China, a longstanding ally of North Korea, has also committed to giving Kim Jong-un “wonderful happiness”.Following President Xi’s strengthened command earlier this month Kim Jong-un sent a glowing letter to the leader of China.Mr Xi then responded promising a closer bond between the neighbouring states - something sure to set alarm bells ringing in Seoul, Tokyo and Washington.  GETTYEarlier this month Kim Jong-un sent a glowing letter to the leader of China   President Xi said: “I express sincere thanks for respectively sending congratulatory messages as regards the facts that the 19th National Congress of the CPC was held and I was elected general secretary of the Central Committee, the CPC, and took office as chairman of the Central Military Commission again some days ago.”“I wish that under the new situation the Chinese side would make efforts with the DPRK side to promote the relations between the two parties and the two countries to sustainable soundness and stable development and thus make a positive contribution to providing the peoples of the two countries with more wonderful happiness and defending regional peace and stability and common prosperity.“I wish the Korean people steadily fresh successes in the cause of socialist construction under the leadership of the WPK headed by Chairman Kim Jong-un.”Then just a week later during the US President’s Beijing visit the nation’s state television cut out as Trump as he blasted America’s relationship with China as “one-sided”.  GETTYDonald Trump visited China during his Asia tourThe station said, “unfortunately we lost the feed”.The news comes as rare photos emerged showing China’s super speed aircraft and hypersonic JF12 wind tunnel being tested.The JF12 can reportedly produce speeds of up to Mach 9 – NASA’s hypersonic wind tunnel reaches to only Mach 7.The photos are believed to show four of Beijing’s super speed strike aircraft including the ‘hyper dragon’ and DF-ZF glider.The DF-ZF glider, which can be launched atop a ballistic missile, is capable of manoeuvring at speeds of between Mach 5 and Mach 10—3 or 836 miles per hour and 7,672 miles per hour.

    Military experts fear Russia and China are developing a missile which will be 25 times faster than an aeroplane.The new missiles will be highly manoeuvrable - unlike current rockets - and be able to fly at up to 25,000km per hour (15,534mph) and will also be able to get between altitudes ranging from a few tens of kilometres to 100km, which is much lower or higher than current surface-to-air missile systems.US Air Force general John Hyten, Commander of the Strategic Command, said he worried about the development of hypersonic missiles by China and Russia.He said: ”Hypersonic technology is concerning to me, but it's really no more concerning to me than any cruise missile technology, any ballistic missile technology."We have to be prepared to defend ourselves against all those threats. And we have to have a deterrent that is ready to respond in case any of those break out."
