   North Korea has ramped up their missile testing in recent months. This has prompted the US to increase its sanctions on the rogue state, which has sparked World War 3 fears. Ban Ki-moon, the former UN Secretary-General has claimed that the rising tensions and threat of war can only be stopped by China, who support the North Korean regime. President Donald Trump has called on China to do more to stand up to North Korea a number of times over fears they are not imposing UN Security Council sanctions on the hermit kingdom. Mr Ban told Bloomberg: “I met the Chinese President Xi Jinping last month as a part of a former President and former heads of State of Government.   GETTY•BLOOMBERGNorth Korea news: Ban Ki-moon claimed China is key to solving rising tensions in North Korea Related articles   N.Korea plots Christmas missile launch?

    North Korea’s most recent missile test took place on November 29, and the regime said the Hwasong-15 missile soared to an altitude of about 2,780 miles (4,475 km) and flew 590 miles (950km) during its 53-minute flight before landing in the sea new Japan.After the missile test Kim Jong-un declared that the North had “finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force”.The US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said they were trying to isolate Kim Jong-un’s state, and claimed North Korea were “stressed out” about the pressure.Ms Haley also urged China to do more to bring North Korea to the negotiating table. “We’re putting as much pressure on them as we can,” she said. “The last time they completely cut off the oil, North Korea came to the table. And so we've told China they've got to do more.”China agreed to UN sanctions on the hermit state which would limit countries from importing North Korean crude oil, iron, lead and coal. China remains North Korea’s biggest trading partner.
