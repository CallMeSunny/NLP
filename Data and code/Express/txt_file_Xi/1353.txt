It makes him look like a man of action, and may help win over his critics in the GOP who have demanded a firmer line on Syria."It also pushes back against the narrative that he is unwilling to stand up to the Russians."However he was elected on a broadly non-interventionist platform; if the strikes don't achieve their goal he might be forced to take stronger measures in order to save face. We've seen before how events in that part of the world can quickly escalate.“The missile strikes do provide Trump with the opportunity to change the media narrative back home. Instead of the ongoing Russian investigation, attention will now be turned to Syria."This story, assuming there are no further developments, will dominate the headlines for a few days and distract people from resignations or reshuffles back home.“In the long term however, the USA's actions might make it much more difficult to negotiate Assad stepping down in the future.”  GettyAt least 28 children were killed in the chemical attack and dozens remain injured7.30am GMT update: Russia and Iran have questioned the US' decision President Assad was behind the chemical attacks.7.25am GMT update: Russia, quoting a Syrian air base worker, said significant damage had been done to the base, rendering all planes out of action.7.10am GMT update: The decision to launch strikes on Syria, with such short notice, has put Mr Trump in the firing line from Mr Assad's allies, especially Iran and Russia.Both countries today denounced the US missile strikes on Syria, with the Iranian foreign ministry saying it is a “violation of international laws” to use a chemical weapons attack as an excuse to take such action.Russian President Vladimir Putin said he believes the strikes broke international law and seriously damaged US-Russia relations, the Kremlin said.
