   North Korea is feared to be plotting a provocative missile launch or even another nuclear test today as the country marks the anniversary of its founding with a huge celebration. Experts believe despot Kim Jong-un could be preparing to celebrate the national holiday in explosive style, setting alarm bells ringing in Seoul, Washington and Tokyo. Now 600 Alaska-based troops have been flown to Japan to take part in drills and boost the number of US soldiers in the region in case the nuclear tension erupts into all-out war. They will carry out Orient Shield military drills with Japanese troops, with Black Hawk helicopters also making the trip for the exercises.   GETTYNorth Korea news: The USA has deployed hundreds of troops amid missile fears North Korea v USA explosive latest pictures Wed, September 20, 2017Images depict how tensions have escalated between North Korea and the United States.
