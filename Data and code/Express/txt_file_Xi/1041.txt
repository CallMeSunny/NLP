  GETTYPrincess Charlotte will be among the last children to see wild elephants alive, says WilliamIn a speech to be broadcast to up to 100 million Chinese viewers on the nation’s most popular television station CCTV1, the Duke of Cambridge appealed to people in the Far East to help end the slaughter by curbing the market in ivory and other animal parts used in trinkets or in traditional medicine.William, who spoke at King’s College, London, before a televised discussion on the Let’s Talk programme involving 7ft 6 in Chinese basketball player Yao Ming, natural history broadcaster Sir David Attenborough, and adventurer Bear Grylls, said: “In the 33 years since I was born we have lost around 70 percent of Africa’s elephant population. Of those that are left, 20,000 are being killed every year – that is 54 elephants killed every single day.  Related articles   Prince George the new Harry? Prince William says son is cheeky...   'Grief is the most painful experience' William opens up about...  At this rate, children born this year – like my daughter Charlotte – will see the last wild elephants and rhinos die before their 25th birthdaysPrince William“At this rate, children born this year – like my daughter Charlotte – will see the last wild elephants and rhinos die before their 25th birthdays.”The future King acknowledged that his royal ancestors once hunted the same species but appealed to China, like his family, to turn away from the slaughter and become a global leader in wildlife conservation. He has campaigned on the issue for two years but with no effect on poaching so far.Appealing to a potential audience of around 100million, who are expected to tune into the pre-recorded programme when shown at a later date, the Duke said: "The desire to possess animal trophies, or ornaments made from ivory, has been felt on every continent for centuries. I know this topic is sensitive for many families."For example, until 100 years ago my ancestors were among those who had little concern about acquiring ivory, without the knowledge of the threats of extinction, corruption, and violence that the ivory trade would lead to."  REUTERSThe Duke of Cambridge appealed to people in the Far East to help end the slaughterChina is a huge consumer of ivory and the trade in the animal product threatens wild elephants with extinction as poachers feed the demand in the Far East.Last year William reportedly said he wanted the ivory kept in the Royal Collection to be removed and destroyed but his family overruled him.William has campaigned with ex-England footballer David Beckham and Yao Ming to end the trade in ivory and other products.  PAPrince William spoke at King’s College, London, before a televised discussionHe raised the subject of the illegal wildlife trade during his meeting earlier this year with Chinese president Xi Jinping, whose country, at the time, imposed a one-year ban on ivory carving imports.The second in line to the throne said today: "My rejection of ivory today is not a judgement of past generations. It is an acceptance of the world as I find it today and the world I want my children, George and Charlotte, to inherit."Likewise, those doctors and medical practitioners in China that are speaking out against the use of endangered species in medicine, they are not judging previous generations who did not have the facts that you do today."They are just accepting the truth that all credible evidence and scientific research shows, for example, that rhino horn cannot cure cancer."  GETTYPrince William appealed to China to become a global leader in wildlife conservationBut he insisted the battle against poaching could be won. "I am absolutely convinced that China can become a global leader in the protection of wildlife."Your influence in the world means you can change the face of conservation in this century. This would be a contribution that would go down in history, one that your great grandchildren would speak of with great pride."His audience - mainly Chinese students studying at King’s - perhaps illustrated the challenge facing him as he tries to change deeply-ingrained beliefs in China. Some knew about his interest in wildlife. "I came from Kunming, which is famous for its wild animals," said Frank Zhao, 19. "Illegal hunting is a big problem."   But others admitted they were there to see Yao Ming, or the show’s presenter, Sa Beining - a famous television personality in China, who was sporting a Union Jack tie - and had no idea until they turned up what the topic under discussion would be.Much of the battle is against ignorance - conservationists say many Chinese are unaware of the slaughter and believe ivory comes from old elephants' teeth that have fallen out naturally.Bear Grylls, who has just spent a month filming in China, said: "Whenever we met young Chinese people they were devastated to hear the reality of what is happening to the rhino and elephant populations."The opportunity for William to go on the programme, broadcast on Saturday nights on the country's flagship channel CCTV1, is testament to the diplomatic success of his visit to China earlier this year.He was given free rein to choose his own topic, and his own guests, for the edition of Let’s Talk.William is also due to hold a one-to-one meeting with China's President Xi Jinping William, who arrived in Britain tonight ahead of a four-day State visit which officially begins tomorrow. He raised the subject of wildlife poaching when he met the president in Beijing earlier this year and is expected to discuss China’s progress in banning ivory and other products when they meet tomorrow.Last week Chinese police seized one of the biggest hauls of smuggled ivory and other rare animal parts and arrested 16 people in a sign that Beijing is cracking down on the wildlife trade.During President Xi’s visit to the US last month the two countries signed a major agreement to halt the domestic trade in ivory, although it fell short of a complete ban.China has for many years been the world's biggest market for illegal wildlife products, including ivory, rhino horn and tiger body parts. Some 70 per cent of the world’s ivory ends up in China.
