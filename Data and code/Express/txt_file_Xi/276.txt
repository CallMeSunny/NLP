   According to Sky sources, Beijing has prioritised a planned visit by the US President and would prefer to welcome the leaders separately, rather than a joint visit.Mrs May's visit had reportedly been planned for several days during the week of November 6th, with parliament scheduled to be in recess from the 7th to the 13th.However, sources have revealed that it was postponed earlier this week because Downing Street officials were told by Beijing that it would not be able to accommodate her in such close proximity to an Asian tour by President Trump.Trump is due to visit five countries in the Far East, including China and Japan, between November 3rd and 14th.
