   The fury over Mr Bercow’s unprecedented intervention grew yesterday as Lord Fowler, who is Speaker of the Lords, said he would keep an “open mind” over allowing the US President to address MPs and peers.Concerns have been raised that Mr Bercow - who was applauded by hard Left Labour and SNP MPs - has put a major trade deal with the US under threat just to seek publicity for himself.The row has erupted as Leftwing MPs and activists have run a campaign to stop a State visit by Donald Trump to the UK.

I think it is regrettable that he did it."Meanwhile, Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi said Mr Bercow should now "think about" his position and explain his remarks to Parliament.The Iraqi-born Mr Zahawi, who criticised Mr Trump's travel ban after learning he could be caught up in it, suggested Mr Bercow was a hypocrite.

AFPPresident Donald Trump was invited to speak in ParliamentThe procedure for approving speeches to Parliament meant that either the Commons or Lord Speakers could "effectively veto any proposals for a visiting leader to address Parliament, at least as far as Westminster Hall is concerned".It was for Parliament to consider whether there was a "better way in which such decisions can be made".There could be a situation where one of the Speakers decided he could not agree to such a speech, Lord Fowler said."Before we reach this point there should be at the very least some effort to reach consensus and a serious discussion of what the decision should be. I hope we can now return to that previous practice."  AFPThe House of Commons Speaker has the power to veto proposals for parliament guestsHowever, after receiving points of order over his behaviour and breach of his neutrality, an unrepentant Mr Bercow defended his comments telling MPs he was acting "honestly and honourably" in carrying out his responsibilities.But Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Crispin Blunt criticised Mr Bercow's comments, saying: "He has no idea whether he will be speaking for a majority of the House of Commons, and this is why Speakers do not express their opinion."That's the entire point, otherwise they can't remain neutral and above the political fray."Britain-based Republican Jan Halper-Hayes, who has reportedly advised Mr Trump's team, said the president would not care about Mr Bercow's comments or speaking in Parliament.

    "I think he's definitely not concerned about what Bercow said and I think that if Theresa May invited him then he would take her guidance," she said."That's who the relationship is with."Asked if Mr Trump would be worried by the furore over him speaking in Parliament, she replied: "No, I don't think that he would."Ben Harris-Quinney, Chairman of the Bow Group think tank, said Mr Bercow had “utterly disgraced himself” with his Trump comments.  PAMPs have called for Mr Bercow to stand down from his position He said: “The role of the Speaker of the House is to neutrally oversee the affairs of the House, it is not, nor has ever been, to grandstand on issues of the day.“John Bercow has unequivocally sought to influence foreign policy and diplomacy towards our closest ally, he has shown hypocrisy in others he has welcomed to Parliament and he has jeopardised a trade agreement with the United States at a crucial time.“Just one of those failings is grounds for a motion of no confidence in his ability to acquit the role of Speaker. He has utterly disgraced himself and his country.     AFPThe House of Commons Speaker defended his comments“I oppose almost everything Barack Obama stands for, however I would never advocate his banning from any area of Parliament or the United Kingdom.“At a time when Britain is faced with the task and opportunity of re-defining its role in the world this behavior is particularly naive, idiotic and childish.“If we want to be a world power again we need grown ups back in charge inParliament.”The news comes as MPs revealed they are plotting to remove Bercow from his Commons role.
