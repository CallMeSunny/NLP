During his election campaign, Mr Trump was quick to praise Putin and routinely criticised China for "using" the United States.Keen to spill the details on his time with Mr Xi in Mar-a-Lago, Mr Trump added: “I’ve spent a lot of time with him over the last two days and he is the president of China. You were there, most of you were there and it was quite an interesting period of time.“President Xi wants to do the right thing. We had a very good bonding, I think we had very good chemistry together."I think he wants to help us with North Korea, we talked trade, we talked a lot of things, and I said the way you're going to make a good trade deal is to help us with North Korea."Mr Trump's praise for the Chinese leader comes hours after his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson received a cold reception in Moscow.But the US President seemed hopeful for his wrecked Russian relationship. He continued: "Right now we're not getting along with Russia at all. We may be at an all time low in terms of relationship with Russia, this was built for a long period of time.
