   The US President had previously spoken aggressively towards Kim, calling him a “rocket man” in his speech to the UN in September.But according to The Wall Street Journal, as then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo was preparing to visit North Korea over the Easter weekend, Mr Trump’s mood changed.He surprised officials by urging restraint, with National Security Adviser John Bolton and Vice President Mike Pence told to tone down their comments.The President told Mr Pence: “Mike, you got it? No f***ing crazy talk from anyone in the administration."He also told Mr Pompeo the administration wasn’t going to change its policy but also needed to give North Korea room to negotiate.

But it wasn't. So I'll solve it, and we'll get it done."
