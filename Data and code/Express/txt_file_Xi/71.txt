    As ASEAN chairman, he last week said he would urge Mr Trump not to be provoked by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, warning of a catastrophe if the situation intensified and that Kim "wants to end to the world".Mr Trump and China have also formed a relationship lately that would have been unthinkable last year, when verbal attacks on China were central to the American billionaire's election campaign.But Trump has been criticised for going beyond the phone call to Mr Duterte and inviting him to the White House.Mr Trump was condemned by human rights groups and some US legislators for what they see as tantamount to an endorsement of Mr Duterte's bloody war on drugs, which has killed thousands of people since he took office 10 months ago.
