   The US President said he would like to strike a deal now but that China was not ready.He said: “I think that we will make a great deal with China and it has to be great, because they've drained our country.”Washington is reported to be preparing to announce tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports by early December if talks next month between Mr Trump and his counterpart Xi Jinping fail to ease the trade war.The US has already imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China has responded with retaliatory duties on $110 billion worth of goods going the other way.
