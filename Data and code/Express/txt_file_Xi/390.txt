 The US is currently seeking China’s help to end North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes.But despite the push for diplomacy Donald Trump’s administration have risked causing outrage in Beijing after sailing near islands claimed by the eastern superpower in the South China Sea.Three US officials have confirmed the USS Chafee, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, passed the Paracel islands to challenge "excessive maritime claims" in the region.US military officials have long argued the region should be open for other nations to travel through, while China, Taiwan and Vietnam all claim the islands belong to them.

      GETTYThe USS Chaffee passed the Paracel islands to challenge 'excessive maritime claims'He added: “But wrong actions on the Taiwan issue, the United States deploying the THAAD system around China, US ships and aircraft's activities in the South China Sea, the United States close-in surveillance in the sea and air near China have had a large, negative influence on bilateral military ties and mutual trust.”However, the course charted by the latest US vessel to cross the waters was more cautious than those that came before it.Unlike in August, when a US Navy destroyer came within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built up by China in the South China Sea, officials said the destroyer sailed outside the range of the islands.Twelve nautical miles mark internationally recognised territorial limits – with former missions within that range making clear the US does not respect China’s claims in the region.The Pentagon did not comment directly on the operation but said the US carried out regular freedom-of-navigation operations and would continue to do so.
