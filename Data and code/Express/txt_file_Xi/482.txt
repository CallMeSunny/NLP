  The head of the Chinese leadership's international affairs office, meets with North Korea's rep In the latest sign that Pyongyang may at last be giving diplomacy a chance, the North's leader Kim Jong Un sent Vice Marshal Choe Ryong Hae – a senior Workers' Party official and the military's top political officer – to China as tensions ease somewhat on the Korean Peninsula.The move follows near-daily vows from Pyongyang to obliterate Washington and Seoul with nuclear force in March and April.Following the threats, the United States, Japan, South Korea, China and Russia have been busy discussing how best to engage with the secretive North Koreans. In a sign of chnaging times, North Korea also revealed today that a former defense minister, Kim Kyok Sik, was promoted to chief of the Korean People's Army in the latest in a series of high-level military reshuffles as Kim Jong Un elevates a new generation of military leaders.Choe's visit is the first this year by a top North Korean official to China, which is under pressure from the U.S. and others to rein in its belligerent neighbor. Foreign analysts see Choe's trip as part fence-mending mission, part appeal for aid.China is impoverished North Korea's economic and diplomatic lifeline, providing nearly all of its fuel and most of its trade. China accounted for 89 percent of North Korea's exports and imports in 2011, according to the most recent figures available from Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency in Seoul, South Korea, which collects North Korean trade data.The last high-level North Korea-China meeting took place when Chinese Communist Party chief Xi Jinping sent a Politburo member to Pyongyang in November. Weeks later, North Korea launched a long-range rocket, followed by an underground nuclear test in February – that test, the country's third, drew tightened sanctions by the U.N. and United States.Choe Ryong-hae poses at Pyongyang airport before leaving for China China is impoverished North Korea's economic and diplomatic lifelineShowing its displeasure with North Korea, China has tightened inspections on cross-border trade and its state banks have halted business with North Korea's Foreign Trade Bank - signs that Beijing is getting serious about enforcing sanctions."The North Korean side has been feeling China's pressure," said Ma Xiaojun, a North Korea watcher at the Central Party School, a think tank for the leadership in Beijing."Our policies and stance have tended to be tougher and more clearly express our unhappiness and displeasure," said Ma. He added, quoting President Xi, "causing trouble on China's doorstep is not right, and China will not tolerate it."Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei reiterated today that Beijing is committed to seeing North Korea denuclearise while maintaining regional stability - a catchphrase for continued Chinese support for Pyongyang.China wants security assurances that North Korea will act with less belligerence and make efforts to ease tension, said Daniel Pinkston, an expert on North Korea with the International Crisis Group think tank who is based in Seoul, South Korea.Because Choe has high-level military and ruling party positions, he can cover a variety of topics and likely will discuss security, normalisation of economic ties and possible requests for aid when he meets with Chinese officials, Pinkston said.Choe may also try to explain North Korea's recent military moves, including short-range projectile launches off the east coast, said Lee Ji-sue, a North Korea specialist and professor at Myongji University in Seoul.He may also be paving the way for a visit by Kim Jong Un, who has not been to Beijing since taking power following the December 2011 death of his father, Kim Jong Il – the elder Kim visited China in August 2011.North Korea sent Choe, one of its top military officials, as a "special envoy" Related articles   North Korea fires FIFTH missile as China issues warning over seized fishing boat   The softer side of North Korea?
