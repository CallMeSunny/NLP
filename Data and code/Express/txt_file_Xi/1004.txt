GETTYPopularity of the sport has soared in China after receiving state backingShenhua's fans vented their anger at the loss."It would be better to spend this huge money on stellar coaches than huge annual salaries for these players," said one fan in a post on Sina Weibo."The season hasn't even started yet and we're out of the Asian Champions League. The crowd is already losing hope."
