   Isolating North Korea further over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests is a key goal for President Trump on what will be his longest foreign trip to date. President Trump will call on President Xi to fully implement UN Security Council resolutions against Pyongyang and take other steps to pressure North Korea. China, North Korea's sole major ally, accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country. China has said it will strictly enforce UN Security Council sanctions banning imports of coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the North.  Related articles   US Air Force deploys F-35 fighter jets to Japan amid World War 3 fears   Next-generation tanks will ditch ‘human senses’ for ‘cameras'   GETTYPresident Donald Trump will urge President Xi Jinping to pressure North Korea We would like to see China follow through on those commitmentsDonald TrumpBut a senior White House official who briefed reporters ahead of President Trump's trip said China needs to do more to comply with two UN Security Council resolutions that were approved unanimously, including with China's support. “We would like to see China follow through on those commitments. We would like to see China do things bilaterally as well that might even go beyond things that are mandated by those UN Security Council resolutions,” the official said. Though China has been angered by North Korea's repeated nuclear and missile tests and demanded they stop, Beijing also sees the United States and South Korea sharing responsibility for rising tensions because of military drills they carry out in the region. South Korea, the United States and Japan started a two-day missile tracking drill today, South Korea's military said in a statement, in preparation for any missile or nuclear threats from North Korea.  Inside Kim's secret army: North Korean military laid bare in smuggled-out pictures Thu, January 11, 2018The true face of Kim Jong un’s army has been laid bare in shocking new images smuggled out of North Korea Play slideshow  Pen News1 of 21A female soldier on duty in high heels
