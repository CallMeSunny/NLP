   The new age space race has seen private firms, such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Dutch company Mars One, enter the foyer in recent years, while Europe has also upped the ante, along with China and Russia’s space program.But is that changing?Over the course of 2016, there has been a change in momentum, with space exploration no longer a matter of national pride, but to which billionaire’s financial muscle is the strongest.Elon Musk and his SpaceX recently succeeded in landing reusable rockets, while he also has his sights set on being the first to get humans on Mars.

GETTYGetting people to Mars has been the focus for manyMars One shares similar ambition, despite the noise around that slowly quietening throughout the year.Another contender, which has not kicked up a huge fuss and has been doing its business under the radar is Blue Origin – founded by Amazon owner Jeff Bezos – which wants to make space exploration available to the general public in the near future.Simon Foster, a physicist from Imperial College London, confirmed to Express.co.uk: “The next space race will not just be between countries, it will be between countries and private billionaires.”   While most of the focus this year has been about getting people to Mars, there have been projects which have not been greeted with as much fanfare.On September 15, China cemented itself as a space exploration powerhouse by firing its space laboratory Tiangong 2 into low Earth orbit, becoming only the third nation, after the US and Russia, to independently get people in to space.President of China, Xi Jinping, said that the mission would "enable China to take larger and further steps in space exploration, and make new contributions to building up China as a space power”.But, “I wouldn’t say they’ll exceed the US”, Dr Foster continued.

It will be a huge leap forward.” Historic Images from the Space Race Fri, December 4, 2015Take a look through history with the first rocket launch in 1950 from Cape Canaveral, all the way to Neil Armstrong preparing to take his first step on the Earth’s moon and the iconic placing of the flag.

    However, Dr Foster believes that Elon Musk will steal the show in the near-future.“I think the really interesting thing is that these private individuals and these States – who is going to make the next breakthrough?“I think it is probably going to be Elon Musk. I think he is doing the exciting stuff.”
