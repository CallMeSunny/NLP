   The Royal Navy declared “freedom of navigation rights” as the HMS Albion passed by the Paracel Islands in recent days on its way to Vietnam.The Albion, a 22,000 ton amphibious ship carrying a contingent of Royal Marines, docked in Ho Chi Minh City on Monday following a deployment in and around Japan.One source said China sent a frigate and two helicopters to meet with the British vessel, but there was no aggression between the two.The other source said the Royal Navy ship did not enter the territorial seas around any of the islands, internationally judged as within twelve nautical miles of the feature.
