It believes it could be used to spy on its use of nuclear missiles.However, US State Department spokesperson Mark Toner appeared to strike down China's idea saying that it was not workable.He told the BBC: "This is apples and oranges. What we're doing in terms of our defence co-operation with South Korea is in no way comparable to the blatant disregard that North Korea has shown with respect to international law."

Bush. It was in response to North Korea's pledge to clean up its nuclear safeguards and to accept international inspections. That deal collapsed in 1993.And, admittedly, the latest round of proposals on the North Korean regime come during a turbulent time following the assassination of the half-brother of the country's leader Kim Jong Un in Malaysia.
