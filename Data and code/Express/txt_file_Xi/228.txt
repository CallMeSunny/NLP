Comrades, thanks for your hard work," Xi called out to the officers standing on deck as the ships sailed past, in images carried on state television."Hail to you, chairman," they replied. "Serve the people."China's first domestically produced aircraft carrier, which is still unnamed, was not present at the ceremony, though the carrier the Liaoning was, the report said.    var brightcoveBrandsafety='4 Sport and specialist news &ndash; passed for ad targeting' State television also showed pictures of the Nanchang at the review, the first of a new fleet of 10,000-tonne destroyers, though details of that and other ships were hard to determine from the footage, due to the intermittent thick mist and rain.China's last major naval parade was last year in the South China Sea, also overseen by Xi.Tuesday's parade featured 32 Chinese vessels and 39 aircraft, as well as warships from 13 foreign countries including India, Japan, Vietnam and Australia.A total of 61 countries have sent delegations to the event, which includes a naval symposium on Wednesday and Thursday.There are fears China may use its navy to expand territorial and maritime control over vast swathes of the contested South China Sea.China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all have competing claims.The area has been nervously established as a potential future conflict zone.
