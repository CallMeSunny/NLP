  GETTYDonald Trump has upset the Chinese with a number of tweets over the weekendThe shock winner of last month's US Presidential Election took a congratulatory phone call from Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen in move that blew 37 years of US foreign policy out of the water in just 10 minutes.The conversation with the Taiwanese leader was the first by a US president since 1979 when Washington embraced a "One China" policy under which Beijing views special territories Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as part of China.To add insult to injury Mr Trump then tweeted: "The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!"

    It was not the first time Mr Trump has complained about China's economic policy but the aggressive language used by the future US Commander-in-Chief took many by surprise.Former Labour Party leader Ed Miliband was unimpressed.He tweeted: "Trump railing against China on Twitter like it is a Celebrity Apprentice feud is not funny, but deeply, deeply worrying for the world."Eurasia Group president Ian Bremner tweeted: "It's almost as if Trump was looking to kick off China relations as badly as possible." It remains to be seen how China's President Xi Jinping will react to Mr Trump's weekend outbursts.
