   The Chinese government acted as a peacekeeper on Friday saying that it was important to prevent a further deterioration in the situation after a U.S. military strike on a Syrian government airfield.Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China also hoped that "relevant parties stay calm, exercise restraint and avoid doing anything that might raise tensions."She made the comments during a regular briefing when asked about the U.S. strike, which came as China's President Xi Jinping was attending a summit in Florida with U.S. President Donald Trump.

GettyTomahawks were launched from USS Ross and USS Abraham Lincoln in the Mediterranean SeaFacing his biggest foreign policy crisis since taking office in January, Trump took the toughest direct U.S. action yet in Syria's civil war, raising the risk of confrontation with Russia and Iran, Assad's two main military backers.China has routinely sided with Russia in blocking action by the U.N. Security Council on Syria, and Beijing's special envoy for the Syrian crisis has praised Russia's military role there as effective in combating international terrorism.While relying on the region for oil supplies, China tends to leave Middle Eastern diplomacy to the other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, namely the United States, Britain, France and Russia.But China has urged that a diplomatic resolution to the violence there be found and has hosted Syrian government and opposition figures.While showing no interest in getting involved militarily, China's Defence Ministry said last year that it had been providing medical equipment and training for Syria.Beijing has its own security concerns about violence in the region, worried that Uighurs, a mostly Muslim people from western China's Xinjiang region, have been fighting with militant groups in Syria and Iraq.A group purporting to be affiliated with the Islamic State issued a bloody video in late February, showing ethnic Uighur fighters training in Iraq, killing prisoners, and vowing to plant their flag in China.  GettyThe air strike launched tomahawk missiles at a Syrian air basePresident Trump launched the deadly US airstrike against a Syrian airbase after Bashar al-Assad’s regime was blamed for carrying out a horrific chemical attack that left at least 80 dead, including 28 children.The US military launched 59 tomahawk missiles at the al-Shayrat airfield near Homs at (1.45am GMT) 8.45pm (EST) killing six people and leaving several wounded on the air base.The missiles were launched from two US Navy destroyers in the Mediterranean sea near Turkey – the first use of Tomahawks by the US since November last year.  GettyForeign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying urged all parties to be 'calm'The strikes, ordered by President Trump on Thursday, mark a sharp policy change from the United States.Speaking shortly after the attack, President Trump said from his Mar-a-Lago estate: ”It is in the vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.“There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the chemical weapons convention and ignored the urging of the UN Security Council.“Tonight I call on all civilised nations in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria."The Pentagon said that the airfield was being used to store chemical weapons.   GettyChina is among the few international countries that have pleaded for restraint in the situationHowever, following the attack, China is among the few international countries that have pleaded for restraint in the situation.Britain overwhelmingly backed the US airstrikes calling them an “appropriate response.”It has offered its full support to the US president.Meanwhile, Turkey's foreign ministry said it viewed the missile strikes as "extremely positive".French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault added that the escalation of the US military role in Syria was a “warning to a criminal regime”.However, Russia has expressed its fury at the surprise attack, branding it “aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law."
