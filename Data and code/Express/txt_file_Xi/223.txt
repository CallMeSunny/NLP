   Officials from Xi Jinping’s government have told their US and South Korean counterparts to stop carrying out joint drills in the region – exercises that are often used as a show of force in response to military tests carried out by Kim Jong-un’s nuclear cronies.In return they believe they can negotiate a stop to the tyrant’s nuclear and missile provocations amid fears tensions could trigger the start of World War 3 on the Korean peninsula.Geng Shuang, China's foreign ministry spokesman, claims freezing military drills in exchange for a freeze on North Korean missile testing was the best means of achieving peace in the region.He said: “China sees the freeze-for-freeze scheme is the most reasonable way.”   GETTYIn return they believe they can negotiate a stop to the tyrant’s nuclear and missile provocations Related articles   North Korea accuse 'Lunatic cockroach Trump' of declaring start of WW3   WORLD WAR 3 – UK's new warship will 'strike fear into heart of Kim' The official’s comments follow a 12-day tour of Asia by President Trump, in which the Republican firebrand met with China’s newly emboldened leader Xi Jinping to discuss bringing an end to the North Korean threat.However, on Wednesday the US President claimed he “would not accept” freeze for freeze plans "like those that have consistently failed in the past”.Mr Geng added: ”The freeze-for-freeze move is just for a breakthrough and the first step."The final objective is to peacefully resolve the North's nuclear problem and realise long-term stability on the Korean Peninsula."
