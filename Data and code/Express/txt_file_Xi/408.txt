They didn’t bother to apologise for.”He accused the United States of blackmailing the Philippines by consistently threatening to suspend arms to the country to get eerie way.

Good friends.“You know, we were previously not so friendly with China because of the well, you know, so many issues, but not in the South China Sea.“So I decided to just visit the ASEAN countries of which we are a member, and just to introduce myself. “I mean, get you in the corner, you know, ‘I’m President Duterte’.“Finally I reached the shores of China and we had a very good talk. And you know president Xi Jinping – he’s really a great guy. “And I realised a little bit that somehow we'd missed out on chances in our history.” Vladimir Putin in pictures Tue, December 13, 2016Russin President Vladimir Putin in pictures Play slideshow  1 of 56
