  GETTYThe pound US dollar exchange rate has been flounderingWith EU member states in the midst of approving the Brexit transition period, this dip could be short-lived.The member states of the European Union are meeting this morning to formally approve the UK's two-year Brexit transition period.UK Prime Minister Theresa May has already hailing progress in negotiations.The Prime Minister has called for a "new dynamic" on the next phase of talks - trade and security.She has also welcomed the US decision to temporarily exempt EU members from its recent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports - set to come into effect today.This is good news for UK industry, though Mrs May and EU Council President Donald Tusk have now both pushed for a permanent exemption, stressing the "huge importance" of the steel industry to the British economy.She said: "I want to ensure that steel workers and their jobs are properly safeguarded."

The White House has asserted that these actions are necessary to counteract the extended period of competition from China's state-led economy.China themselves have both a sizeable trade surplus against the US and a wide range of tariffs on imported goods.China has quickly responded with threats to retaliate with "necessary measures", including a possible 25 per cent levy on pork and sanctions focusing on agriculture in general.China, however, is also calling for the US to negotiate a settlement and "pull back from the brink" - and is seemingly keen to talk rather than directly engage.Nonetheless, President Xi Jinping could be pushed into some form of tariff response in order to not appear weak so soon after the draconian changes to China's constitution that have given him the ability to lead for life.This chaos seemed to keep the US dollar on an uncertain footing, negating the recent rate hike from the US Federal Reserve.In slightly better news for the US, however, the government has officially passed the massive $1.3tn spending bill, thus funding the government through September and reducing some market concerns.
