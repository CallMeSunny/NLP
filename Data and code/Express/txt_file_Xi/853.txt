   The US President issued the chilling warning during a meeting with 15 UN Security Council ambassadors, including China and Russia, at the White House on Monday.Mr Trump said: “The status quo in North Korea is also unacceptable."The council must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programs."

North Korea is a big world problem and it's a problem that we have to finally solve."People put blindfolds on for decades and now it's time to solve the problem."His comments come as satellite images of North Korea’s nuclear plant shows activity and Kim Jong-un’s chiefs have vowed they will go to war if provoked.South Korean and US officials have feared for some time that a sixth North Korean nuclear test could be imminent and speculation has grown that this, or another missile test, could coincide with the 85th anniversary of the foundation of North Korea's army on Tuesday.

     This is a real threat to the world, whether we want to talk about it or not. North Korea is a big world problem.Donald TrumpThe reclusive state showcased new missiles during a military parade to celebrate the 105th anniversary of North Korea’s founder Kim Il-sung earlier this month, including what experts believe may have been intercontinental ballistic missiles.According to US officials tougher sanctions could include an oil embargo, banning North Korea's airline, intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks and other foreign doing business with Pyongyang.The US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will be chairing a special ministerial meeting of the Security Council about North Korea on Friday to discuss ways to maximise the impact of existing sanctions and show "resolve to respond to further provocations with appropriate new measures".
