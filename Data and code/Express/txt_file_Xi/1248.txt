   John Bercow is returning as the Commons Speaker despite previously indicating he would step down from the position.The Speaker pledged in 2009 to only serve for nine years but he has recently revealed that he wished to remain in his role until the next parliament in 2022.The 54-year-old said just before the General Election: "I'm looking to the people of Buckingham to re-elect me as their Member of Parliament and then I will, if I am successful in that quest, ask the House whether it is willing to allow me to continue as Speaker for the 2017 parliament which can run up to five years."Mr Bercow sparked fury in February after saying that he strongly opposed US President Donald Trump addressing MPs and peers during his state visit to the UK later this year.He cited his “opposition to racism and sexism” after 1.8 million people signed an online petition calling for the state visit to be cancelled."After the imposition of the migrant ban, I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall," Mr Bercow said.

     After the imposition of the migrant ban, I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster HallJohn Bercow, House of Commons speakerNigel Farage argued that the Speaker had overstepped the mark, adding: “For Speaker Bercow to uphold our finest parliamentary traditions, he should remain neutral.” In 2013, Mr Bercow was condemned as "a disgrace to the office of Speaker" after he suggested that Eastern European immigrants have more "aptitude and commitment" to work than Britons.At the time Mr Farage told the Daily Telegraph: "It is outrageous that Mr Bercow is happy to overthrow the wisdom of ages and think it acceptable to comment on matters that are both highly political and deeply contentious."He is a disgrace to the office of Speaker. There are very good practical and constitutional reasons why the Speaker is neutral, reasons that he obviously believes are beneath his own august self-image."  PAChinese President Xi Jinping speaks in the Palace of Westminster's Royal Gallery in 2015 Can John Bercow stop Mr Trump from addressing Parliament?As one of the “three great keyholders” to Westminster Hall, the speaker is able to overrule entry to the Parliament estate. Mr Bercow also opposes Mr Trump addressing MPs and peers in the Royal Gallery, which is often used for state receptions. The Speaker said: “I do not perhaps have as strong a say in that matter. It is in a different part of the building.“Although customarily an invitation to a visiting leader to deliver an address would be issued in the names of the two Speakers.“I would not wish to issue an invitation to President Trump to speak in the Royal Gallery.”   PAWhat does John Bercow do? What is the Speaker of the House of Commons? Mr Bercow added: “If a state visit takes place that is way beyond and above the pay grade of the Speaker."However, as far as this place is concerned I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons." Mr Bercow succeeded Michael Martin - now Lord Martin of Springburn - who was Speaker from 2000 to 2009.Baroness Boothroyd, elected the 186th Commons Speaker in 1992, was the first woman to hold the office.Lord Weatherill, who was elected as Speaker in 1983, was the first House of Commons Speaker in the age of Parliamentary television.
