   The warnings come amid rumours that President Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to £43billion ($60billion) of Chinese imports.The tariffs would be chiefly targeted at information technology, consumer electronics and telecoms.But they could be much broader and the list could eventually run to hundreds of products.However, President Xi Jinping is ready to fight back against any sanctions slapped on Chinese goods, experts warn, and the fight could be more costly for the US.

We're prepared.' And they are. Because of course they have a very large market and a very robust economy.“We should remember two things. One, Chinese exports to the United States improve the American standard of living by selling less expensive goods to United States that we benefit from — and we don't make those goods anymore."Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said: “We have said many times that China resolutely opposes any kind of unilateral protectionist trade measures.“If the United States takes actions that harm China’s interests, China will have to take measures to firmly protect our legitimate rights.”And, in a strongly worded opinion piece in state-run Chinese newspaper the Global Times, Beijing has been encouraged to give Washington “head-on blows.”  GettyChinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang warned the US on protectionist trade measures.It said: “Beijing needs to give Washington head-on blows in a similar manner and must not be soft.“China has to brace for trade wars both in strategy and mentality.“If the US indeed wages a worldwide trade war, it will find itself in an awkward position.“By hanging tough, Trump wants to gain as many benefits as possible for his country so as to appease his voters and win re-election. He has done well at this until lately.“But he shouldn't invoke confrontation. Once a trade war starts, capable countries won't bow to the US China has tried hard to avoid a trade war, but if one breaks out, appeasement is not an option."  GettyLarry Kudlow prefers to see a "coalition" of major US trade partners confront China America had a trade deficit with China totalling $276 billion last year.However, experts suggest that this was due to economic conditions rather than policies.Mr Trump appears likely to target Chinese technology companies to punish China for its investment policies that effectively force US companies to give up their technology secrets in exchange for being allowed to operate in the country, as well as for other IP practices Washington considers unfair.And members of the Trump administration seem determined to pick a fight with China.Larry Kudlow, 70, who became Mr Trump’s new chief economic advisor yesterday, recently expressed his disdain at Beijing over trade.He admitted that he had initially opposed the blanket tariffs on steel and aluminium imports that were announced by Mr Trump last week.He preferred to see a "coalition" of major US trade partners confront China to let the world's second-largest economy know "they are breaking the rules left and right."
