    He added: “Is it good for my people if China takes countermeasures against France in retaliation? No.”The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed anti-China uprising and set up a government in exile there.He says he seeks only greater autonomy for Tibet, not outright Independence, and has even expressed a desire to return to Tibet.Beijing accuses Tibet’s de facto spiritual leader of seeking independence through “spiritual terrorism”.
