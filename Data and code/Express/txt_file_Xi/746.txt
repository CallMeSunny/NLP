The Duke is grateful to have this opportunity to explain how people around the world must work together to save some of the planet's most critically endangered speciesA Kensington Palace spokesmanSources have suggested that he and Kate will also attend their first State banquet in honour of the Chinese president, although Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace have not confirmed that yet. Conservationists hope that the president's visit and the support of his country's State television for William's initiative will enhance chances of the Chinese government announcing new measures to clamp down on the demand for ivory and other animal parts used either to make trinkets or traditional medicines.Charlie Mayhew, chief executive of conservation charity Tusk Trust, said between 25,000 and 30,000 elephants were being slaughtered per year to fuel the trade in ivory but many Chinese had no idea that animals were suffering. "For many Chinese, the word for tusk is the same as the word for tooth. They think it's old elephant teeth that have fallen out," he said.  GETTYThe Duke of Cambridge will make a 10-minute speech in EnglishWilliam, 33, his brother Prince Harry, 30, and their father Prince Charles have spent two years campaigning to raise international awareness of the plight of some of the world's most majestic animal species. Last year they helped host an international conference on the illegal trade in wildlife.Mr Mayhew said their work had helped ensure that many nations, including China, were now taking the issue more seriously. But asked if there was any sign that poaching or the market for ivory and other products had reduced, he replied: "Sadly, the short answer to that is no."  GETTYWilliam has already discussed illegal animal poaching with Chinese President Xi JinpingA Kensington Palace spokesman said: "The Duke is grateful to have this opportunity to explain how people around the world must work together to save some of the planet's most critically endangered species before they are lost forever. He considers this issue an important test for his generation's ability to solve the much more complex global challenges it will face in the decades to come. "He was pleased to raise this issue with the President of China when they met in Beijing earlier this year and has been encouraged by China's willingness to play its part in the fight against the illegal wildlife trade."The television appearance, which is expected to be broadcast within three weeks of recording, is one of a number of engagements lined up for William and Kate as they begin juggling parental duties with royal events and the Duke's job as an air ambulance pilot in East Anglia. Neither will be fulltime working royals but are expected to be slightly busier after a summer spent largely at Anmer Hall, their country retreat in Norfolk, with their two young children, two-year-old Prince George, and Princess Charlotte, who was born on May 2.
