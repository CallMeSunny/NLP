    Chinese President Xi Jinping has made fighting official corruption a cornerstone of his reign.Since 2012, Xi’s anti-corruption campaign has jailed and snared hundred of leaders - including former Chongging Communist Party General Secretary Sun Zhengcai.However, the Chinese President’s huge crackdown on corrupt politician has been heavily condemned.Victor Shih, a politics professor at the University of California, San Diego, said: "Xi has a very particular vision of where China is going: for China to enter the centre stage of world affairs and reshape the global order".     Internet and press censorship has also increased under Xi, meaning there are few alternative voices (Image: Getty)He added: “He feels he needs control every little detail to achieve those goals, and will silence officials he thinks stand in his way.”Internet and press censorship has also increased under Xi, meaning there are few alternative voices to even offer moderate differences to the party line.He has openly said the media should be a tool of the Communist party and sending an offending tweet is now enough to land someone in jail.“There are a variety of alternative viewpoints, whether it’s religion, civil society or the media, and Xi doesn’t want anyone to question the direction he is taking China,” said Ely Ratner, a senior fellow for China studies at the Council of Foreign Relations.
