    However, US President Donald Trump was quick to take to Twitter to blast: “Caught RED HANDED - very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. “There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen!”The Trump administration has led a drive to step up global sanctions on North Korea in response to Pyongyang's efforts to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.Kim Jong-un’s rogue regime has tested a number of ballistic missiles in recent months and has claimed to now have the ability to strike US mainland with a nuclear bomb.It is feared that North Korea could have up to 60 nuclear weapons which they may launch against the South, Japan or the US if a full war broke out.Washington says the full cooperation of China, North Korea's neighbour and main trading partner, is vital to the success of this effort, while warning that all options are on the table, including military ones, in dealing with North Korea.The UN Security Council last week unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea for a recent intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test, seeking to further limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil.The UN resolution seeks to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year.

China is actually more afraid of North Korea than America.”More to follow…
