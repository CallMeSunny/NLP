    But Trump immediately rubbished Jong-un’s claims tweeting: "It won't happen!"Hours later, the President-elect turned on Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, and publicly disgraced his nation for failing to condemn their North Korean ally’s spiritless behaviour.   Trump tweeted: “China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the US in totally one-seed trade, but won’t help with North Korea. Nice!”In response, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said: "China's efforts are widely recognised, and we hope all sides will avoid remarks and actions to escalate the situation.”In what seems like a bid to secure a budding relationship with Trump, South Korean officials confirmed that North Korea had at least 300 drones and around 10 machines capable of conducting severe attacks, but said their weapons could rival Jong-un's.  GETTYSouth Koreans seem to be full of praise for TrumpAlthough South Korea has secured a potential trade deal with Trump, Park Geun-hye, the South Korean president, appointed a Foreign Affairs official to monitor Donald Trump’s Twitter account, paying special attention to his tweets surrounding Korea and north east Asia.South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs praised Mr Trump’s stance on North Korea and said it issued a “clear warning” to Kim Jong-un.
