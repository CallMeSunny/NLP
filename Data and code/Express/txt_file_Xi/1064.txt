   Huawei has been previously scrutinised by the US, claiming the mobile technology firm is “controlled by the Chinese government” before stepping up efforts to ban the company from operating on American networks. Tensions between China and the West have intensified further after Canadian Police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on December 1 in Vancouver airport at the request of US authorities. US prosecutors accused her of misleading banks about transactions linked to Iran, putting the banks at risk of violating American sanctions.

People hold signs in support of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co. (Image: GETTY)"They said that by arresting two Canadian citizens as retaliation for Canada’s detention of Meng, China was bullying Canada.“To those people, China’s self-defence is an offence to Canada. If someone slaps you on your left cheek, give him your right cheek, they told us. But I have never seen them doing as they said.”Continuing, Mr Shaye said: “The reason why some people are used to arrogantly adopting double standards is due to Western egotism and white supremacy.“In such a context, the rule of law is nothing but a tool for their political ends and a fig leaf for their practising hegemony in the international arena. What they have been doing is not showing respect for the rule of law, but mocking and trampling the rule of law.”
