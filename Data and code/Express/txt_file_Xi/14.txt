  GETTYNorth Korea's Kim Jong-un praised China's Xi JinpingThe friendly gesture by the North Korean leader, who seldom issues personal messages, comes as China is being urged by the international community to do more to rein in the North's missile and nuclear tests that have raised tensions globally.Xi became China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong at the all-important week-long congress.North Korea’s state run news agency said in a statement: "It expressed the conviction the relations between the two parties and the two countries would develop in the interests of the peoples of the two countries.”The letter said "the Chinese people have entered the road of building socialism with the Chinese characteristics in the new era" under the guidance of Xi.

    Without elaborating, he said: "China and North Korea are close neighbours and have a tradition of friendly contact.”China has said it will strictly enforce U.N. Security Council sanctions banning imports of North Korean coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the North.North Korea has not engaged in any missile or nuclear provocations since mid-September, although it tends to test fewer missiles late in the year for unexplained reasons.Kim Han-kwon, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy in Seoul, said: "North Korea has been walking a diplomatic tightrope by taking advantage of strategic mistrust between China and Russia, but it has not been easy as Beijing has sternly responded to its nuclear and missile provocations."China's party congress is over, but Kim Jong Un's concerns will only continue to deepen. The most significant event at hand is the upcoming summit between Xi and (U.S. President Donald) Trump.”
