   The US President flew into Singapore's Paya Lebar Air Base aboard Air Force One a few hours after Kim arrived in the southeast Asian city-state.The pair are due to meet at 9am on Tuesday on the resort island of Sentosa for their high-stakes summit, the first-ever talks between a US and North Korean leader and the culmination of head-spinning diplomacy.Kim had earlier flown into Changi Airport after his longest trip overseas as head of state wearing his trademark dark Maoist suit and distinctive high cut hairstyle.He was greeted by Singapore's foreign minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, who posted a picture on Twitter of him shaking hands with Kim and the message: "Welcomed Chairman Kim Jong Un, who has just arrived in Singapore".

Many remain sceptical Kim will ever completely abandon his nuclear programmes. They believe his latest engagement is aimed at getting the United States to ease crippling economic sanctions that have squeezed the impoverished country.Mr Trump, who has led a "maximum pressure" campaign against North Korea, has insisted that Kim first provide verifiable proof that he will irreversibly dismantle North Korea's nuclear arsenal.But Kim has shown surprising diplomatic skills in his meetings with overseas leaders this year and a smiling and affable side as he went clearly out of his way to be cordial to Mr Moon.
