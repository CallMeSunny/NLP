      GETTYSecretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Karen Bradley backs the move   "Pinewood is one of our most iconic brands and, building on the recent state visit to the UK by Chinese president, Xi Jinping, I'm delighted to see Pinewood further expanding its presence in the international market," she said. In July, Pinewood said the plunge in sterling following Britain's decision to quit the European Union would give it a boost, adding that the impact of Brexit would be "largely mitigated" as its most significant customers are based in the US.
