  GettyChina has long been hailed as North Korea's only allyJin Qiangyi, from the Yanbian University in China, stated that if the Asian superpower continues to pile the pressure on the hermit kingdom, there “might be a crisis”.He stated: “North Korea doesn’t let the outside world see, but things have started to become very difficult.“If we push it harder, we should consider that there might be a crisis, and a lot of people could starve.”China, long hailed as the North’s only ally and partner accounting for over 90 per cent of its trade, has started to clamp down on Kim Jong-un as international pressure from the UN to implement sanctions grows.

    “Now, none of those people have jobs.”Imports from the Asian superstate dropped by roughly 33 per cent last year - figures from December also showed a shocking 82 per cent decrease from the year prior.Exports of oil products have almost completely collapsed since October - however many foreign officials claim that crude oil is not included in the figures.   Despite the added squeeze on the regime of Kim Jong-un, US officials and experts on the matter have declared that it will not deter the leader in his ambitions for a deadly nuclear arsenal.In addition to garnering finances from trade, the hermit kingdom has also dabbled in cyber tactics and arms sales to parts of the Middle East and Africa.Sigal Mandelker, the US’ top sanctions envoy, emphasised that the sanctions were introduced in a desperate attempt to force the North Koreans into sitting at the negotiating table before the rogue state is able to strike the US with nuclear weapons.He declared: “Ultimately, we want to get to a place where Mr Kim understands that his only choice is denuclearisation and talks.“We don’t have many options, so if this doesn’t succeed, we’re going to be in a very different place.”It is widely believed that Kim could have the capability to strike US mainland as early as the summer.
