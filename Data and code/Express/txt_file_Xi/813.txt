   US President Donald Trump plans to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion (£42 billion) on Chinese goods.The phone call between the counterparts is the highest level contact between the two governments since President Trump announced his plans to impose the tariffs.Mr Liu, a Harvard-trained economist who advises President Xi Jinping, said China hoped both sides would remain "rational" and work together to keep trade relations stable, the official Xinhua news agency said.He said: "China has already prepared, and has the strength, to defend its national interests.” Related articles   Theresa May STAYS at summit in bid to seal Trump steel tax reprive   Brexit news: EU customs union costs the UK this much   China has already prepared, and has the strength, to defend its national interestsLiu HeOn Friday Beijing had showed its readiness to go toe to toe with Mr Trump and proposed new levies on 128 American imports sparking further feats of a trade war between the superpowers.The Chinese government warned that Beijing might place tariffs on $3 billion of US goods such as pork, apples and steel pipes.China also wants to place a 15 percent tariff on US fresh fruit and wine.Taking a hardline against the US, the Chinese government made it clear the penalties were in response to Mr Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminium imports that he announced earlier this month.  GETTYChina has hit out at the US over Trump's tariffsHe Weiwen, a trade policy expert and former commerce ministry official, said: “China’s overall attitude was it never wanted a trade war to begin with.“But now that tariffs have been announced, China’s purpose is . . . to stop a trade war from continuing.”US officials say an eight-month probe under the 1974 US Trade Act has found that China engages in unfair trade practices by forcing American investors to turn over key technologies to Chinese firms.However, Liu said the investigation report "violates international trade rules and is beneficial to neither Chinese interests, U.S. interests nor global interests”.In a statement on its website, the office of the US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said it had filed a request - at the direction of Mr Trump - for consultations with China at the World Trade Organization to address "discriminatory technology licensing agreements".  gettyChinese president Xi Jinping wants to place a 15 per cent tariff on US fresh fruit and wineChina's commerce ministry expressed regret at the filing on Saturday, and said China had taken strong measures to protect the legal rights and interests of both domestic and foreign owners of intellectual property.Fears over a tit-for-tat campaign of escalating tariffs between Beijing and Washington has sent a chill through financial markets and the corporate world as investors predicted dire consequences for the global economy should trade barriers start going up.The Trump administration set import tariffs on Thursday of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium but exempted Canada and Mexico and offered the possibility of excluding other allies, backtracking from an earlier stance.Mr Trump imposed the tariffs after claiming the metal trade threatened “national security” by degrading the American industrial base.

    The US tariffs have met a barrage of criticism at the WTO meeting attended by the EU, Japan, China and Russia.Prime Minister Theresa May also expressed major concerns earlier this month about the US President’s import tariff plans and fears are continuing to grow about the prospect of a trade war.A Downing Street spokesman said: “The Prime Minister raised our deep concern at the President’s forthcoming announcement on steel and aluminium tariffs, noting that multilateral action was the only way to resolve the problem of global overcapacity in all parties’ interests.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also hit out at the tariffs and said: “we consider these tariffs unlawful”.
