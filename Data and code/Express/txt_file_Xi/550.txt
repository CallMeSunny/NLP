    Britain said back in 2015 it would become a founder member of the bank based in the Chinese capital Beijing. President Obama, Mr Trumps’s predecessor, was far from pleased when he heard of this news. A US official told The Financial Times: “We are wary about a trend toward constant accommodation of China which is not the best way to engage a rising power.”Beijing is the largest stakeholder in the AIIB with a third of subscriptions. The UK has three per cent in the company.  Related articles   North Korea: China will AMP UP pressure on Kim Jong-un thanks to Trump  China developing wind tunnel for weapons travelling 7 miles per SECONDThe bank already has 58 member states involved. Once Britain joined, Germany and France followed.AIIB’s aim is to be a green institution and avoid investments in power stations and coal. George Osborne supported the AIIB when he was chancellor as the coalition government had a heavy reliance on Chinese cash.Britain needed investments from China in nuclear power and high-speed rail and airports.   So far the bank has approved projects including rural roads to connect 1,060 villages in the Indian state of Gujarat and improving dams in Indonesia.A Treasury spokesman said the aim was “to support the bank’s focus on unblocking constraints to growth and jobs and to mobilise private finance”.He added: “We are on the front foot about the AIIB being part of strong relationships with China.”Britain’s annual aid figures show the country sent out £13.4 billion this year, a 10 per cent rise from last year’s £12.1 billion. A Government spokeswoman said: “Our aid commitment increases Britain’s global influence and alongside our world class defence and diplomacy helps the UK to create opportunity peace and prosperity.“UK aid is saving lives: immunising 80 children a minute against polio, getting food and shelter to people fleeing violence in Burma, taking on the Syrian children the chance to go to school and learn.”
