    The UN Security Council decided last month to impose new penalties on North Korea for its intercontinental ballistic missile test.This included setting tougher limits on refined petroleum products and crude oil supplies to Pyongyang.In the past, Beijing has repeatedly acted as Pyongyang’s diplomatic protector however, North Korea's recent reckless behaviour has begun to drive a wedge between the two nations.The UN measure also demands the repatriation of all North Koreans working abroad within 24 months.Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, have resisted previous US pleas for an outright oil embargo but agreed to the latest limit.   GETTYMongolia has been exporting tobacco to North Korea since 2016Under the latest restrictions, Chinese companies will only be allowed to export 4 million barrels of oil and 500,000 barrels of refined petroleum products per year.They are barred from supplying the dictator run-state with military or weapons programs.Some North Korean exports to China will also be restricted, including equipment, grain, timber and other agricultural products.
