   The US president could issue the order, which has been under consideration for more than eight months, as soon as in January, three sources familiar with the events told Reuters.

However, sources said the text has yet to be be finalised.  Related articles   Spy fears force removal of £2bn Chinese technology from UK 999 systems   US-EU trade war: Former US Ambassador WARNS of 2019 WTO crisis The order comes as the MI6 warned phones and equipment made in China could be used by the Chinese Government to spy or sabotage foreign countries.China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, attacked the US government saying it is acting “without any evidence”.She said: ”It's best to let facts speak for themselves when it comes to security problems."Some countries have, without any evidence, and making use of national security, tacitly assumed crimes to politicise, and even obstruct and restrict, normal technology exchange activities.    Donald Trump could issue a national emergency executive order targeting China's Huawei and ZTE (Image: GETTY)READ MORE: ‘Slanderous!’ Furious China demands US and UK retract spying accusations as tensions ERUPT"This in reality is undoubtedly shutting oneself off, rather than being the door to openness, progress and fairness."Mr Trump launched a trade war against Beijing earlier this year, when he issued in March a 25 percent tariff on all steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on all aluminium imports.More than 150 days later, the tariffs imposed by Washington on China’s exports currently amount to £197.85bn ($250bn).  Related articles   World War 3: China starts BOMBER DRILLS as it BOASTS military strength   USA vs China TRADE WAR: China to overtake US as world’s top economy   Donald Trump launched a trade war against China in March (Image: GETTY)  China's president Xi Jinping (Image: GETTY)The ones imposed by Beijing on US exports reached £87.02bn ($110bn). Meanwhile, Britain’s Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has spoken of “grave” and “very deep concerns” about Huawei being involved in the UK’s 5G network, telecommunication companies’ next step to give users super fast internet.He said: “We’ve got to look at what partners such as Australia and the US are doing to ensure they have the maximum security of that 5G network and we’ve got to recognise that the Chinese state does sometimes act in a malign way.”London’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport is looking into the UK’s telecoms market to see if it’s too reliant of China’s companies.
