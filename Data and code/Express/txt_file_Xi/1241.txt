  EPA / GETTYDonald Trump wants to ‘dramatically deepen’ co-operation with IndiaSpeaking less than a month before President Donald Trump is due to make his first state visit to China, Secretary Tillerson said the United States had begun to discuss creating alternatives to Chinese infrastructure financing in Asia.In another comment likely to upset Beijing, he said Washington saw room to invite others, including Australia, to join Indo-US-Japan security cooperation, something Beijing has opposed as an attempt by democracies to gang up on it.The remarks coincide with the start of a week-long Chinese Communist Party congress at which President Xi Jinping is seeking to further consolidate his power."The United States seeks constructive relations with China, but we will not shrink from China's challenges to the rules-based order and where China subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries and disadvantages the U.S. and our friends," Secretary Tillerson told the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.Related articles   EU chief lashes out at Trump with blistering attack   GETTYRex Tillerson said the US had begun to discuss alternatives to Chinese infrastructure financing India and the United States should be in the business of equipping other countries to defend their sovereignty"India and the United States should be in the business of equipping other countries to defend their sovereignty, build greater connectivity, and have a louder voice in a regional architecture that promotes their interests and develops their economies," Secretary Tillerson added.The US decision to expand relations with India almost certainly will upset India's rival, Pakistan, where Secretary Tillerson also will stop next week, said a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.Pakistan was the main US ally in South Asia for decades, but US officials are frustrated with what they charge has been Pakistan's failure to cut support for the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, where the administration wants India to play a bigger role in economic development.As part of a South Asia strategy unveiled by Trump in August, Secretary Tillerson is expected to press Islamabad, which denies aiding the Taliban, to take stronger steps against extremists and allied groups and intensify efforts to pressure them to agree to peace talks with Kabul. "We expect Pakistan to take decisive action against terrorist groups based there that threaten its own people and the broader region," Tillerson said.President Trump has threatened further cuts in US aid to Pakistan if it fails to cooperate.China, a strategic rival to the United States and India, is also vital to Trump's efforts to roll back North Korea's efforts to create nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the United States, an issue expected to top the agenda in Trump's November 8-10 Beijing visit.A senior State Department official defended the timing of the speech, saying Secretary Tillerson also said he wanted a constructive relationship with China."For many decades the United States has supported China's rise," said the official. "We've also supported India's rise. But those two countries have risen very differently."  GETTYPresident Trump threatened further cuts in US aid to PakistanThe Chinese Embassy in Washington said in a statement that Beijing "contributes to and defends the rules-based world order" and seeks to enhance international cooperation."We will never seek hegemony or engage in expansion, never pursue development at the expenses of others' interests," it said.Secretary Tillerson did not say what he meant by creating an alternative to Chinese infrastructure financing, but said the Trump administration had begun a "quiet conversation" with some emerging East Asian democracies at a summit in August.  GETTYSecretary Tillerson also will stop in Pakistan next weekHe said Chinese financing was saddling countries with "enormous" debts and failing to create jobs."We think it's important that we begin to develop some means of countering that with alternative financing measures.""We will not be able to compete with the kind of terms that China offers, but countries have to decide what are they willing to pay to secure their sovereignty and their future control of their economies and we've had those discussions with them as well," he said.Related articles   North Korea threatens Donald Trump with ‘UNIMAGINABLE’ strike  TERROR WARNING: Isis plotting 9/11 style attack – Trump security chief  North Korea claims Trump worse than HITLER in 'America First' attack
