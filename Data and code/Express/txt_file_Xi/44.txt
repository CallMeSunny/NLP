    The leader of the hermit kingdom made the trip with his wife.Images of the couple were shown on Chinese state television - they were shown greeting officials.The trip took place from March 25 to March 28.  TwitterThe trip took place from March 25 to March 28Kim’s visit to China is considered to be the first the leader has taken since his fathers death towards the end of 2011.The entire event was kept extremely secretive with only a sighting of the North Korean train giving any indication the trip was going ahead.China has long been heralded as the North’s sole ally and biggest trading partner.The Asian superstate was seemingly targeted as the key to diffusing tensions with North Korea by the US who has pushed for Xi Jinping to cripple the hermit kingdom with sanctions.US Defence Secretary James Mattis had previously offered a qualified confirmation of the rumours by stating that it “kinda looked like” the trip had taken place.Kim Jong-un’s father, Kim Jong-il met with then Chinese leader Jiang Zemin back in the year 2000 - at the time the visit was seen as a reaffirmation of the close ties between both nations.
