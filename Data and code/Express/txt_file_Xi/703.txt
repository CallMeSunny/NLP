   The Thomas G Thompson research vessel stopped in the port of Kaohsiung on the southern side of the disputed island on Monday, in a move which has angered officials in Beijing.Taiwan’s Defence Minister, Yen De-fa, defended the 274ft ship’s activities and said the docking was “unrelated to military activity” while the country’s state-owned Central News Agency said the ship was only there to refuel and change crew.But China’s foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang hit back and issued a stark warning to the Pentagon. He said they saw the scientific research vessel’s movements in the South China Sea as threatening.He said that China wanted to “express our solemn concerns to the US” about the ship’s visit which has been viewed by officials in Beijing as a military action which has escalated tensions between the two countries.
