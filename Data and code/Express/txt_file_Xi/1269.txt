    “Many of these poor animals are stolen pets, who must be utterly bewildered and terrified by their ordeal, and their owners must be frantic knowing what a dreadful fate awaits their beloved companions.“There are no animal protection laws in China whatsoever, so these animals need the world to speak out for them and implore the Chinese government to end this appalling spectacle of cruelty.”Fellow campaigner Will Young tells the camera that he could not wait to join the HSI’s #StopYulin campaign for the sake of his own beloved dogs, border terrier Esme and standard dachshund Nelly.“Esme and Nelly mean the world to me, so when Humane Society International asked me to support #StopYulin, I said yes straight away,” he explains. “The thought of them being stolen, crammed onto the back of a truck in a tiny cage, and ending up terrified in a Yulin slaughterhouse, is heart-breaking.  SGAlesha Dixon, with her two dogs please with the Chinese authorities to stop the slaughter“HSI works in partnership with Chinese campaigners representing the millions of Chinese citizens who want this awful trade to end too. They have my support, please give them yours, too.”Adding his voice to the campaign, Professor Green, who appears in the video with his bulldog Arthur, says: “I don’t understand the mentality of people who treat animals so cruelly, and I really admire Humane Society International and their Chinese activists for stopping illegal dog meat trucks and rescuing the animals. “It’s all too easy to look away and say it’s culture, but the truth is most people in China don’t eat dogs and the Yulin festival is out of step with a new generation of Chinese people who want a new culture of compassion.”HSI says that 10,000 dogs and cats face slaughter at next month’s Yulin Festival, the most visible and unacceptable face of China’s continuing pet meat scandal that claims the lives of up to 20 million animals every year.Ironically, most people in China do not eat dog and pressure within the country for the cruel and largely illegal trade is increasing on the authorities.  SGThe celebs are backing a HSI campaign to end the mass slaughter Most of the animals that end up being caged and then butchered in front of each other are stolen pets or strays dragged off the streets. Many of the animals are still wearing their collars as they arrive at slaughterhouses.Yet far from being a tradition, the Yulin Festival was staged for the first time only six years ago and is seen as commercial rather than cultural event.HSI says the festival was invented by dog meat traders to boost flagging sales and endorsed by local authorities in the hope of attracting tourism but the gamble has spectacularly backfired with Yulin becoming infamous globally as a symbol of China’s gruesome dog meat trade.Xing Hai, a Chinese activist working with HSI, said: “I’m ashamed of China’s Yulin dog meat festival. It stains our reputation around the world and it doesn’t represent the modern China that my generation wants to see.  Related articles   Skinned eel 'STILL ALIVE' slowly being cooked to death on grill  GRAPHIC CONTENT: Hunt on for thug caught on camera PUNCHING his dog...  Sadist caught on film torturing terrified cat“The dogs and cats who end up in this trade endure an unimaginable amount of suffering, including deliberate pain in the misguided belief that the more they suffer, the better their meat will taste. “These old fashioned ways of treating animals need to end, which is why we are so happy that people all over the world are supporting our efforts. It means a lot to us.”HSI is calling on the public to sign and share its petition calling on Chinese president Xi Jinping to halt the Yulin Festival.• For more information: #StopYulinpetition at www.hsi.org/stopyulin<http://www.hsi.org/stopyulin>
