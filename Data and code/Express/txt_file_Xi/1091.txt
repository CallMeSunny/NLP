   Mr Trump said the US would want concessions over Syria or Ukraine in return for lifting Russian sanctions.But in a separate move, the US today confirmed it was imposing more sanctions on Russian firms it accused violating trade bans on North Korea.Mr Trump made his remarks during a wide-ranging Oval Office interview with Reuters news agency, during which he talked about Turkey, a possible meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping – and of course relations with Russia.He explained he had discussed various issues with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their summit meeting in Helsinki last month.

You have Ukraine. You have many other things,"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded: "We of course welcome statements that affirm a readiness to cooperate, but we would welcome even more some kind of concrete actions.”He said Russia was keen to hear more details from the US on any proposed cooperation in Syria and Ukraine, and that Kiev should also take positive steps.   He added: "We need to be specific about what is expected from Russia in terms of Ukraine, and why nothing is expected from the Ukrainian authorities.”Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and has backed separatists in the country's industrial east fighting Ukrainian government forces.Mr Trump’s hints of some sort of conciliatory move contrast sharply with the US Treasury Department’s announcement today of fresh sanctions against Russian firms operating out of the Eastern port of Vladivostok, which is just miles from the North Korean border.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said: “The Treasury Department is disrupting Russian efforts to circumvent our sanctions.
