  GETTY/PAIn 2015 there were more than 200,000 Chinese tourists to the UKNo one is quite sure although theories abound that they are there because some episodes of Inspector Morse were filmed in nearby Thrupp, or because they wrongly believe that the streets were used for Harry Potter’s Privet Drive.Or perhaps they think it’s linked to that perennial favourite Midsomer Murders?No one seems to know for sure. But whatever the truth this is just the latest indicator of the Chinese love affair with Britain, because travellers from the Far East are visiting as never before.

The Chinese market is maturing very quicklyPatricia YatesIn the first nine months of 2015 there were more than 200,000 Chinese tourists to this country, 37 per cent up on the previous year, spending an average of £2,700 per visit – £435million in total – one of the highest of all by visitors from overseas.According to one forecast they could be spending £1billion a year by 2020.Favourite locations include Buckingham Palace and the discount shopping centre Bicester Village in Oxfordshire which boasts luxury labels that will be cheaper than ever this year due to the fall in sterling.   Indeed, many luxury designer stores actively seek sales assistants who can speak Mandarin.Last year’s visit to Britain by Chinese president Xi Jinping sparked further interest among his countrymen: “The Chinese market is maturing very quickly,” said Patricia Yates, director of VisitBritain.“Ten years ago they came in groups or on business. Now we are seeing more coming as individuals or families.”Visitor numbers have been given a further boost thanks to the likely ongoing weak pound. Shanghai Daily has just reported a surge in bookings since the referendum, while Shanghai Spring Tour has revealed that most of its summer guided visits to the UK are sold out.

Favoured locations were cited as being Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford, Cambridge and London and the Government has been keen to encourage this.From January this year visitor visas for tourists were extended to a two-year valid period – four times longer than the average elsewhere.Businesses are also catering to the Chinese: in recent years Madame Tussauds has created waxworks of past Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin and Deng Xiaoping, while its parent company Merlin, which also owns Legoland, the London Eye and Thorpe Park, has said it intends to cater increasingly to the Chinese.

    As for those Chinese who are not able to get to the UK there is a consolation in the East, of sorts. In 1994 a theme park called Window Of The World opened in Shenzhen City containing miniature representations of 130 of the world’s most famous landmarks.The section devoted to the UK contains the Palace of Westminster, Buckingham Palace, Tower Bridge and Stonehenge.And if you like it enough to want to live there you could take up residence in Thames Town, which was completed in 2006 and is 19 miles outside Shanghai. Complete with red telephone boxes, mock-Tudor houses and a church, only the Chinese street signs signify that you are not in the UK – but the town lies empty and is used mainly as a backdrop for weddings.But weddings with a British flavour… it’s the new Chinese way.
