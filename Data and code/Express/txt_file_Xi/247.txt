    A tourists guide claimed that the border forces belong to the Chinese People's Liberation Army.A recent tourist to that area of China said tourists were being made to spend a large period of their time undergoing security inspection from Chinese troops.   They said: “We spent more time being checked than sightseeing.”They added that troops examined passports, mobile phones and there belongings.
