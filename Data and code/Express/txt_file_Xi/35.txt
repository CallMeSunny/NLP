    Mr Aslam added: "China has certainly been the net beneficiary of cheap labour which caused massive changes for industry in the US."Keeping the peace in Asia is just another item on the agenda which will be important for both leaders to talk about."Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex.com, added: "Mixed signals from the US economy couldn’t prevent the Dow Jones from finally bursting back into life this afternoon."The thrust of the Dow’s gains seemed to stem from the ADP non-farm reading, which vastly outperformed expectations at 263k against the 184k, February’s figure, on the other hand, was revised from an extraordinary 298k to a more reasonable 245k."
