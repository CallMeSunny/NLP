   Downing Street is understood to have held high-level discussions about potential clashes when President Trump, who rejects climate change, meets Prince Charles and younger members of the monarchy, who are all well-known environmentalists.There are fears any rows could disrupt the visit, which it is hoped will get Mr Trump on-side to secure the UK a post-Brexit free trade deal with the US.There are also concerns that the President may flout royal protocol by tweeting details of private conversations he has.

GETTYMeghan Markle once dubbed Trump a 'misogynist' and threatened to leave the US if he became presidentNews of the dilemma comes just days after Trump accepted an invitation from the Queen to visit the UK later this year.The formal invite was delivered by Theresa May when she met him on Friday. It is thought the visit could take place as soon as the first week in June.It has been suggested that instead of Prince Charles taking the lead, the younger Royals, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, be put centre stage for the trip.But harnessing the popularity of the younger Royals may not be easy. Privately Harry, who formed a close bond with the former First Lady Michelle Obama, is understood to be wary of Trump, who once bragged about wanting to have sex with Princess Diana.And William will not have taken kindly to a 2012 tweet by the President in which he poked fun at Kate being photographed topless, saying: “Who wouldn’t take Kate’s pictures and make lots of money if she does the nude sunbathing thing?”Charles has already set himself on a collision course with Mr Trump after making a series of veiled attacks about his attitude towards climate change and refugees.Before Christmas, the Prince issued a warning over the “rise of populism” and, writing in a new Ladybird book, described climate change as the “wolf at the door”.

    A minister last night insisted that any difficulties would be resolved in a “grown up fashion” but admitted there were concerns about Prince Charles and protestors disrupting the state visit.“There is concern he might lecture the president on climate change or ask him if he has read his book,” he said.“There is also concern that the visit could be the subject of protest along the Mall.”The Prince will attend a lunch in the President’s honour at Buckingham Palace and is then expected to host Trump and his wife Melania for tea at Clarence House, the London home he shares with his wife Camilla.A source close to the Prince said: “He may or may not be at the state banquet.”  GETTYCharles missed a white-tie event when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited in 2015Much was made of Charles missing a white-tie event when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited in 2015, triggering speculation that he was taking a stand against China’s human rights abuses.Meanwhile, a Foreign Office source said there were concerns that Trump may flout royal protocol by tweeting details of private conversations with his hosts.On a more positive note, Charles Crawford, the former British ambassador to Sarajevo, Belgrade and Warsaw, said while the visit would be a challenge diplomatically, the Royals might be relishing the chance to meet Trump in person.

      GETTYDonald Trump will be the 11th President of the United States to meet the QueenHe said: “The Queen has met ten presidents – if any royal eyebrow is raised by the eleventh, it will be imperceptible.“The thing to understand about state visits beyond all the noisy political issues is that for the Queen, these are her personal house guests.“State visits can sometimes be quite dry, so the Royals may be looking forward to this one.“Frank conversations will take place behind palace doors – that’s part of the point.”
