   North Korea’s state media lashed out at its Chinese counterpart, which is also state controlled, saying that calls for tougher sanctions over Pyongyang's nuclear programme were undermining relations with Beijing and worsening tensions.The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) carried a story which referred to recent commentaries in China's People's Daily and Global Times newspapers, which it said were "widely known as media speaking for the official stand of the Chinese party and government".KCNA continued: ”A string of absurd and reckless remarks are now heard from China every day only to render the present bad situation tenser.  AFPNorth Korea leader Kim Jong-un"China had better ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by its reckless act of chopping down the pillar of the DPRK-China relations.”Attacking Chinese media, the KCNA accused Chinese articles of attempting to shift the blame to Pyongyang for "deteriorated relations" between China and North Korea and US deployment of strategic assets to the region.It also accused China of "hyping up" damage caused by North Korean nuclear tests to China's three northeastern provinces.KCNA added Chinese state media calls for North Korea to dismantle its nuclear programme were "a wanton violation of the independent and legitimate rights, dignity and supreme interests" of North Korea and constituted "an undisguised threat to an honest-minded neighbouring country which has a long history and tradition of friendship”.

    The KCNA commentary said calls by "some ignorant politicians and media persons" in China for stricter sanctions on North Korea and not ruling out military intervention if it refused to abandon its nuclear program, were "based on big-power chauvinism."It said North Korea's nuclear programme was needed for the "existence and development" of the country and "can never be changed nor shaken."Despite counting China as North Korea's only major ally, the KCNA suggested Pyongyang does not value the alliance. The commentary said: "The DPRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] will never beg for the maintenance of friendship with China."
