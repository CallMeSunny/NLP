    “The government continued to accuse individuals and religious organisations of engaging in so-called ‘cult’ activities. Underground house churches are particularlyvulnerable to these accusations.”The ruling Chinese Communist Party is officially atheist with more than half of China’s 1.4billion population not associated with any religion or belief. Those following one of China’s five officially recognised religions – Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism, and Protestantism – and affiliated with one of the corresponding state-sanctioned “patriotic religious associations” are protected in theory from the government’s crackdown on religion.
