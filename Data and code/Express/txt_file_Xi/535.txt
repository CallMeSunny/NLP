  GETTYThe US has placed China on a global list of worst offenders in human trafficking and forced labourThe reprimand of China, Washington's main rival in the Asia-Pacific region, would come despite Trump's budding relationship with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping and the U.S. president's efforts to coax Beijing into helping to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has decided to drop China to “Tier 3,” the lowest grade, putting it alongside Iran, North Korea and Syria among others, said the sources, who have knowledge of the internal deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity. The rating is expected to be announced today in an annual report published by the State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.  Related articles   Amber Rudd pledges to flush out gangs behind human trafficking   Human traffickers are selling women in Scotland to other crime groups A State Department official declined to comment on the report's contents and said the department “does not discuss details of internal deliberations.” Tier 3 rating can trigger sanctions limiting access to US and international aid, but US presidents frequently waive such action. While it was unclear what led Secretary Tillerson to downgrade China, last year's report criticised the communist government for not doing enough to curb “state-sponsored forced labor” and concluded it did not meet “minimum standards” for fighting trafficking - though it still said Beijing was making significant efforts.   GETTYThis step could aggravate tension with Beijing that has eased under President Donald Trump   The Trump administration has also grown concerned about conditions in China for North Korean labour crews that are contracted through Pyongyang and provide hard currency for the North Korean leadership, which is squeezed for cash by international sanctions, said the congressional source.  China resolutely opposes the US side making thoughtless remarksLu KangIn Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the government was resolute in its resolve to fight human trafficking and the results were plain to see. “China resolutely opposes the US side making thoughtless remarks in accordance with its own domestic law about other countries' work in fighting human trafficking,” he told a daily news briefing. Since taking office, Trump has praised Xi for agreeing to work on the North Korea issue during a Florida summit in April and has held back on attacking Chinese trade practices he railed against during the presidential campaign.   GETTYChinese president Xi JinpingBut President Trump has recently suggested he was running out of patience with China's modest steps to pressure North Korea, which is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States. The annual report, covering more than 180 countries and territories, calls itself the world's most comprehensive resource of governmental anti-human trafficking efforts.  Discover the disputed islands of the South China Sea Wed, May 10, 2017Among the islands at the heart of territorial disputes in the South China Sea.

    It organises countries into tiers based on trafficking and forced labor records: Tier 1 for nations that meet minimum US standards; Tier 2 for those making significant efforts to meet those standards; Tier 2 “Watch List” for those that deserve special scrutiny; and Tier 3 for countries that fail to comply with the minimum US standards and are not making significant efforts.   GETTYMr Trump recently suggested a lack of patience with China's modest steps to pressure North KoreaFor the past three years, China has been ranked “Tier 2 Watch List”. In Beijing, the Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. In 2015, Reuters reported that experts in the State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons had sought to downgrade China that year to Tier 3 but were overruled by senior diplomats.
