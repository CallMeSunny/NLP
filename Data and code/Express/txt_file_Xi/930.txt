   North Korea has continually heckled the US with threats of World War 3, prompting US President Donald Trump to warn of military action in an effort to shut down the rogue nation’s nuclear regime.But the president of the Security Studies Group, Jim Hanson, warned North Korean leader Kim Jong-un must shut down the nuclear regime or face war with the US.Speaking on Fox News, the securities expert said: “He’s dealing with the guy who wrote the part of the deal and he’s going to have to make real concessions or he is going to watch his nuclear facilities turn into radioactive rubble.“That’ll focus your mind and I think it makes for much better negotiations.”  GettyNorth Korea news: Jim Hanson said Kim Jong-un must denuclearise  He’s going to have to make concessions or watch his nuclear facilities turn into radioactive rubbleJim HansonMr Hanson insisted Kim Jong-un must denuclearise. He said: “There’s no place short of that. That’s President Trump’s policy.“He’s made that perfectly clear and either Kim Jong-un gives up the North Korean nuclear programme or between sanctions and actual kinetic action against his facilities – one way or another he is done as a nuclear power.”President Trump has agreed to meet with the North Korean leader but no details have so far been confirmed.Kim Jong-un made a secret visit to China's capital Bejing on Tuesday in what is believed to be the leader's first trip outside of the rogue nation since his ascent to power.

    Speculation about a high-ranking official from Pyongyang visiting Beijing circulated on social media earlier in the week after Japan’s Kyodo News showed a North Korean train travelling into China.Melissa Hanham, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, in Monterey, California, said: "Recent tensions and increased nuclear and missile capabilities mean China’s taking this seriously and doesn’t want to be left out of the process."President Trump was told Mr Kim’s meeting with China's President Xi Jinping “went very well”.In response, Mr Trump said he is keen to meet with the North Korean leader and believes denuclearisation is now possible.But North Korea expert Gordon Chang said the meeting is “not good” for the United States, who, without China, can “push around” North Korea.Mr Chang insisted China must be “pushed to the sidelines” or it could be impossible to shut down North Korea’s nuclear regime.
