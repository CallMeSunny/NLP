    Mr Turnbull was left stumped, however, when Mrs May took a playful jab at him regarding the UK-Australia cricket rivalry. The Prime Minister said she was especially happy to welcome Mr Turnbull to London a day after England recorded their first cricket Women's World Cup victory over Australia since 1993.Mrs May said: “It's always a pleasure to welcome our Australian friends to London, and even more so when you've just beaten them at the cricket."That's the women's cricket of course."   The visit builds on a successful weekend for Mrs May, who secured positive meetings with Donald Trump, Japan and China at the G20.Mr Trump said “there is no country that could possibly be closer than our countries” after meeting Mrs May.He said: “We have been working on a trade deal which will be a very, very big deal a very powerful deal, great for both countries and I think we will have that done very, very quickly.”Meanwhile Chinese President Xi Jinping said his country was experiencing a “golden era” of relations with the UK, with Mrs May also holding successful one-to-one talks with Japanese PM Shinzo Abe.
