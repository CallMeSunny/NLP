All of these countries have retaliated.The US president's new hard line on trade, which saw him withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact (TPP) last year, shows a remarkable change from the free trade policies that have governed the exchange of goods in America for decades.In an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk Francesco Moscone, Professor of Business Economics at Brunel University London explains how the trade war will affect other countries.Prof Moscone said: “We live in a world where countries are interdependent.US-CHINA TRADE WAR: WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR?

This is especially true combined with a strong US dollar and higher interest rates.“It means the whole emerging market excluding China will be debt trapped.“The conflict will eventually lead to global economic instability due to a trade war started by a tweet.”
