Oscar lays down a landmark that says 'we're in a rush, we've said football is going to be one of our next horizons and we want to bring in the best'."That's where ultimately I see our challenge coming to the Premier League. It will not come from Italy or Spain. They will always be there in some shape or form, likewise the Bundelsiga."The MLS is a good export but it's over there and won't challenge the Premier League any time soon. The A-League in Australia is now the standard of the Championship now. But that's a long way away."

GETTYOscar joined Shanghai SIPG for £60m   The Chinese transfer record was broken four times last winter and is expected to be shattered again as the government rapidly invests in the sport.President Xi Jinping wants China to host and win the World Cup by 2050 - and their plan right now is to lure the world's biggest names in the peak of their careers to their domestic league.But with the emergence of China comes a new method of dealing with player transfers.Transfer fees are stumped up by investors who have government backing on their side. And Smith, whose book The Deal unearths the hidden underworld of football's transfer dealings, says that creates added complexities when clubs and agents negotiate moves."The whole thing is politically based, so you've got to know the guys at the top of the political system," he added.  GETTYOscar will play under former Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas  GETTYChinese football has already surpassed the MLS's ability to sign big-name stars"You can't just turn up. Even if I was let's say John Terry's agent, it's difficult just to turn up and say 'John wants to come to China'."You've got to know the right entry points, know the right club, do the right deal at the right club."There are funds that flow to different investors in China, which are all government based. And the government is continually in a state of challenge and change."There are power points if you like in any of these quite austere regimes."While China is beginning to lure players away from the Premier League, businessmen and consortiums have started investing in the top flight clubs themselves.West Brom, Aston Villa and Wolves all have Chinese owners, while varying consortiums have bought Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid and Espanyol. China has a stake in UAE-owned Manchester City, while Birmingham are run by owners from Hong Kong.   GETTYAston Villa are one of a number of English clubs owned by Far East businessmen and consortiums  GETTYManchester City are also part owned by a Chinese business groupAnd Smith believes there more logic behind the deals than simply buying historic clubs in the pursuit of sporting glory."For whatever reason at the time it's seen as a bit like what Roman Abramovich did (at Chelsea)," Smith said."It gives them a credibility, a protection factor. It gives them currency. And there's a bundle of reasons why these guys buy football clubs."It's interesting why some of them buy clubs, like the guy who bought Aston Villa."Then he gets challenged. People don't know where the money's come from, who they are. Is the power pack behind him in favour at the time? It's a very complex situation dealing with the Chinese at this time."  GETTYChelsea sold Ramires to the Chinese Super League last year  GETTYLiverpool missed out on signing Alex Teixeira after a late bid from China scuppered the dealChelsea also sold Ramires to China last year, while Liverpool missed out on Brazilian Alex Teixeira who joined Jiangsu Suning despite holding talks with the Reds.There are claims Wayne Rooney, Terry, and even Alexis Sanchez could be offered big money to move to the Far East.And Smith admits the wages being offered to these big stars would turn anyone's head."China is still a long way away and is not yet an attractive proposition," he says."If I was Alexis Sanchez would I be going to China? If I was offered £400,000 a week and tax was an optional extra? Of course you'd think about it."But part of that mindset is 'I'm over there then and that's sort of the end of me as a footballing force'."European clubs currently have until the end of the month to complete their player transfers, but this is China's big off-season window that runs until the end of February.Ramires, Teixeira and Atletico Madrid's Jackson Martinez all moved during in February 2016 - after the European windows had shut.

      GETTYDidier Drogba (right) endured a brief stint in China before heading to GalatasarayDidier Drogba is one of the few big-name players to have gone to China and then returned to win trophies back in Europe.Drogba lasted six months in Shanghai on staggering wages but was swiftly sent back to Europe, with Galatasaray picking up the Ivorian before his second stint at Chelsea.And Smith says that deal exposed the fragility of China's transfer system."That investor got himself into trouble, he supposedly didn't have the money which means someone high above him didn't supply him with the right political credibility or whatever was needed," Smith says."It's complex and when you do these deals a lot of people are involved. A lot of people are included and you have to know the script."
