  GETTYXi Jinping is set to assume a title to put him on par with Mao Tse-tungThat is the view of multiple sources with ties to the Chinese leadership, including senior party officials, former officials and foreign diplomats who have talked to top officials. Much of it has also been signalled in various ways in the state media in recent months.President Xi was born into revolutionary aristocracy and came of age in the tumult of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution. Since taking office five years ago, he has cast aside decades of precedent, stamping his authority on the party's 89 million members and asserting China's rising might on the global stage.Having been perceived as a colourless, unambitious "princeling" child of the elite before catapulting into the apex of power as a Standing Committee member in 2007, President Xi has surprised time and again, leadership sources, diplomats and experts say. He has locked up political rivals for corruption, accumulated titles and pushed painful reforms for the military.China's State Council, which doubles as the party's spokesman's office, did not respond to a request for comment on President Xi's plans for the 19th Party Congress or on how the party evaluates his first five years in office.

In another first, President Xi has already overseen two large-scale military parades in his first term, including a dramatic display of China's rising power and military capability through Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 2015.What will actually happen at the congress, and what President Xi will say in his state-of-the-party address at its opening, are closely guarded secrets, even as the party and state media have flagged the broad outlines of what will happen.One of the most important signals to watch at the congress will be whether - or how often - President Xi is referred to as "lingxiu", or leader.That honorific has been bestowed only on two others since the 1949 founding of the People's Republic of China: Chairman Mao and his short-lived successor, Hua Guofeng.Using the term over the congress could set him up to be named party chairman, a title that has not been used since Hu Yaobang, who died in 1989, sources with ties to the leadership and diplomats say.  GETTYPresident Xi could also end up being called party chairmanPresident Xi is currently head of the party but with the title general secretary, and has to rule by consensus with his Standing Committee, part of a system of collective leadership set up after Chairman Mao died to prevent a recurrence of the chaos that erupted under him.If he does become chairman, that will spell the end for the concept of collective leadership, said a senior Beijing-based Asian diplomat."He won't have to answer to anyone," the diplomat said.President Xi has gathered other titles gradually since late 2012, when he first became party chief, just before assuming the presidency.He also runs the National Security Commission and the top financial and reform decision-making councils. And despite already being head of the military, he was appointed commander-in-chief last year.
