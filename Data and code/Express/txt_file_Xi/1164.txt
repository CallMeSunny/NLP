    Tensions are reaching boiling point ahead of tomorrow's "Day of the Sun", the 105th anniversary of the birth of state founder Kim Il Sung.But that is not going down well with President Trump who has said North Korea was a problem that "will be taken care of" and he believed Chinese President Xi Jinping would "work very hard" to help resolve it.That in return has sparked fury in the isolated state with  the North's KCNA news agency issuing a direct threat.It reported: "The Trump administration, which made a surprise guided cruise-missile strike on Syria on April 6, has entered the path of open threat and blackmail."The army and people of the DPRK will as ever courageously counter those who encroach upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK and will always mercilessly ravage all provocative options of the U.S. with Korean-style toughest counteraction."
