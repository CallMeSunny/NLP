  PAThe Ethiopian government burns seized ivory to discourage poaching Prince William, President Barack Obama and China’s Xi Jinping are three of the world leaders campaigning to stop elephants falling victim to poachers’ guns and traps.Yet for all the diplomatic and political will to smash the ivory racket, huge quantities of ivory are still being smuggled out of Africa almost daily.New figures today show more than 32 tonnes of poached ivory have been seized this year, with at least 18 consignments in excess of 500 kilograms.In stark terms, the ivory seizures equate to £110 million and a staggering death toll of 100 elephants killed every day.Numbers of the world’s largest land creature have crashed by 62 per cent over the last decade and as few as 400,000 remain in the wild.Prince William has spoken about his children growing up to find that elephants and rhinos have gone the way of other other extinct species. If the rate of slaughter is not checked, oblivion for elephants could happen inside a couple of decades.Even as new 2015 figures emerged, the seizures continue.  GETTYThese three are all outspoken opponents of the illegal ivory tradeTanzanian authorities have today seized tusks from as many as 45 elephants and arrested two suspects in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam. The 156 ivory pieces discovered weigh more than 200kg and are valued at £450,000.This pales to some of huge seizures of contraband ivory during the year.In April, two separate operations saw seven tonnes of ivory recovered in Thailand and the following month 3.7 tonnes was confiscated in Singapore.Vietnamese law enforcers swooped on 3.9 tonnes during three separate operations earlier in the year and only last week they uncovered 2.2 tonnes from Mozambique.For Interpol, such large seizures are a sign that organised crime is running the illegal trade.  GETTYIllegal ivory is also being destroyed in China Over and above the large-scale seizures, one cannot ignore the innumerable smaller quantities of ivory seizedKelvin Alie“It is worth reflecting that since the first reported seizure of 2015, on the January 2, not a single week has passed without law enforcers confiscating illegal ivory,” said Kelvin Alie, Director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare’s Wildlife Trade Programme.“Over and above the large-scale seizures, one cannot ignore the innumerable smaller quantities of ivory seized.“In total, IFAW’s records show that 142 seizures of ivory were reported in the media during the course of 2015, with the majority of those taking place in South East Asia and Asia, in particular Thailand, Vietnam and China and in countries across Africa.”  GETTYElephants are at risk of extinction if the illegal trade continuesAlie says that between 25,000 and 50,000 elephants are dying each year for their ivory.Accurate figures for ivory seizures in 2014 have yet to fully emerge, but between January and August of that year, 17.8 tonnes was recovered by the authorities. The tripling of the price of ivory in China since 2010 is the driving force for the mass slaughter of elephants.Rhinos are suffering the same fate but the death toll for 2015 is being kept under wraps by the South African government whose country remains the great bastion of these rapidly vanishing animals. Up to August, poachers are thought to have killed 749. Last year, 1,215 rhinos died for their horns, still prized as a cancer cure in the Far East.   Last month the plight of South Africa’s rhinos got worse when the country’s high court allowed the resumption of domestic trading in their horns.For all the global seizures of ivory, IFAW says it is crucial that governments look beyond confiscations and also aim at disrupting and dismantling trafficking networks.Alie added: “The only way countries are going to stop poaching of elephants and illegal trade is by cooperating with bodies such as the International Consortium for Combatting Wildlife Crime  and partner institutions such as Interpol and the law enforcement bodies of other governments to map and profile those behind this transnational criminal activity and dedicate the resources needed to stop those who seek profit from ivory trafficking.“There is a great need to focus on strategies that will halt the killing of these magnificent creatures.”
