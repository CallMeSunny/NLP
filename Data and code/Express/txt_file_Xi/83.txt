    "I believe that the United States and China are cooperative partners, and through joint efforts we can push bilateral relations to a historic new high," the statement cited Xi as saying."The development of China and the United States absolutely can complement each other and advance together. Both sides absolutely can become very good cooperative partners," Xi said.Relations between the US and China looked in danger when Trump angered Beijing by speaking with Taiwan’s leader after winning the presidential election.  GETTYTrump is widely expected to try and establish trade deals with ChinaLast week, however, the Foreign Ministry in Beijing claimed China and the US remain “in close touch” amid hopes of renewed relations between the two powers.Trump recently wrote a letter to Xi, telling him he is looking forward to developing a “constructive relationship” with China.The President thanked his Chinese counterpart for congratulating him on taking over the Oval Office last month, and wished China a prosperous Year of the Rooster.The news comes as Trump is set to host Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe on Friday in his latest meeting with other global leaders.Lawyer James Zimmerman, the former head of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said Trump should have never raised the "one China" policy in the first place."There is certainly a way of negotiating with the Chinese, but threats concerning fundamental, core interests are counterproductive from the get-go," he said in an email.  GETTYPresident Xi responded in a separate statement showing his appreciation of Trump's position"The end result is that Trump just confirmed to the world that he is a paper tiger, a 'zhilaohu' - someone that seems threatening but is wholly ineffectual and unable to stomach a challenge."The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, but is also Taiwan's biggest ally and arms supplier and is bound by legislation to provide the means to help the island defend itself.China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since 1949, when Mao Tse-tung's Communist forces won the Chinese civil war and Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to the island. China has vowed to bring Taiwan under its rule, by force if necessary.
