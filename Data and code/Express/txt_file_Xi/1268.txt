  ITVThe Queen has revealed she does like it when her grandchildren use their phone too muchShe gave her verdict on modern technology at a Buckingham Palace garden party, where aides insisted it was business as usual despite a security breach on Wednesday evening when a 41-year-old man was arrested after scaling the perimeter wall and roaming around the palace grounds for seven minutes before police, alerted by an alarm, arrested him. The 90-year-old monarch, who became an internet hit earlier this month when she joined Prince Harry in a video clip taking the mickey out of US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle before the Invictus Games for wounded warriors, said she relied on her family to show her what to do. But she bemoaned the fact that young people spend so much time on smart phones and other technology these days.  Related articles   PM forced to accept Brexit MPs change to Queen's Speech   Queen security review after intruder scales Palace wall  [The Queen] didn't like them to be on their phones and computers all the timeBarbara WilkinsHer comments came four days after her grandaughter Princess Beatrice, 27, was photographed playing with her phone while sitting directly behind the Queen at an equestrian-themed 90th birthday celebration for her at the Royal Windsor Horse Show. The monarch was speaking to Barbara Wilkins, 82, who runs eight pre-schools and received the British Empire Medal in the New Year's Honours for services to education. She was picked out to speak to the Queen and said they had discussed how much children had changed. "The Queen was talking to me about young children and asked me if they had changed a lot," she said.   AFP • GETTYThe Queen bemoaned the fact that young people spend so much time on smart phones"I said they are all digital these days and I said that instead of sitting at the dining room table having conversations like I did with my children they are all sitting on the settee with their teas on their knees watching television. "She agreed. She said her grandchildren did things for her digitally but she didn't like them to be on their phones and computers all the time. She says they need social skills. She was like any other grandmother really." Mrs Wilkins, a widow from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, was accompanied by her proud children Angela and Christopher.   GETTYThe Queen admitted that she does need help when she goes to use a computerShe said of the Queen: "She didn't say exactly what her grandchildren did for her but she did say she gets them to sort her out on the computer. Well she didn't use the words sort her out but you know what I mean. She actually said she gets them to help her out and to do things for her. I have to say she has fantastic communication skills being able to talk to anybody about anything at any time." The Queen, resplendent in a mint green one-button coat and a cerise dress by Karl Ludwig Couture with a matching hat by Philip Sommerville, was attending her first garden party since she was caught on camera last week criticising the Chinese delegation at last year's State visit to Britain by President Xi Jinping.  The Queen: Every year of her reign in pictures Thu, April 19, 2018On February 8, 1952, Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth II formally proclaimed herself Queen and Head of the Commonwealth and Defender of the Faith.
