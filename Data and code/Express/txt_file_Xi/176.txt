  GETTYMacclesfield Town Hall chiefs have snubbed an invitation from China's leader President Xi JinpingThe Cheshire town of Macclesfield, once famous for its weaving industry, is seen by many historians as the western end of the historic Silk Road. With officials in Beijing identifying it as the potential final destination for China’s 21st-century version of the ancient trade route, local politicians were invited to pay them a visit. But Tory council leaders responded by saying they cannot justify the jaunt at the taxpayers’ expense, despite the potential economic windfall.  Related articles   European Commission Vice President makes sly dig at populism   China rages at EU for blocking Belt and Road initiative Local heritage consultant Graham Barrow attacked the shortsighted decision, despite the obvious benefits for industry and tourism, as being more sour than sweet. He said: “President Xi has been promoting the modern Silk Road to revive cultural and economic links to Europe. “It’s a fantastic opportunity, a modern concept, a modern Silk Road for our post-Brexit relationship with China.”   GETTYThe Cheshire town  is seen by many historians as the western end of the historic Silk Road   The New Silk Road launched in 2013 by Mr Xi aims to use Chinese-built infrastructure to unite Asia, Africa and Europe by land and sea.  We really don’t want councillors to be seen as having jolliesBeverley DooleyHe called the plan to re-draw the global economic map the “project of the century”. In a statement the council said: “While we are pleased to see the interest shown locally in further developing the silk heritage story in Macclesfield, with its links to China, the trip there is not something the council is able to resource at this time.” Conservative councillor Beverley Dooley said: “It would be something I wouldn’t want the ratepayers of Macclesfield to pay for.“It could easily be seen as a jolly and that’s not something we want. In a time when there are lots of cuts we really don’t want councillors to be seen as having jollies.” In its Victorian heyday Macclesfield had about 70 silk mills employing more than 15,000 people, with traditional weaving skills and materials being imported from China. Today the town has a silk museum, the Macclesfield Town football team is nicknamed The Silkmen and even the town’s ring road is called The Silk Road.  In pictures: Thousands cram into Chinese water park Mon, July 31, 2017As the temperature reached 32 degrees Celsius in Fushun, China, people enjoyed themselves in the slightly overcrowded water park Play slideshow  Getty Images1 of 7People play with inflatable rings and toys at a water park to avoid heat
