    The pastor said: “The North Koreans are hard to change, and they have this dark side of human nature. Even if we clothe them and feed them, after a while, they will still turn against us and do bad things to us.”North Korea is ranked as the most dangerous country in the world for Christians, according to charity Open Doors. A spokesman for the advocacy group said: “Christians face arrest, torture, imprisonment and death for daring to believe there is a higher authority than the nation's leader, Kim Jong-un. “Many follow Jesus in secret; parents often don't even tell their children about their faith for fear they will be revealed.   AFP GETTYDefectors face torture and imprisonment on their return to Kim Jong-un's secretive state“Thousands of other Christians are trapped in horrific labour camps and isolated closed villages. But despite the risks, North Koreans are still choosing to follow Christ.”Once in China, Christians continue to be under threat with churches ordered to register with the state and facing strict surveillance. Worshippers have been beaten and jailed for hanging crucifixes as Xi Jinping’s regime cracks down in religious freedom.
