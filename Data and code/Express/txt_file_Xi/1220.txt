Kirkwood went on to say her perspective on politics had changed “enormously” since the play was performed in 2013.She said she was “really blindsided” by the extent to which Western democracy was “vulnerable to demagoguery” following the election of Donald Trump to the White House in 2016.“Many drafts of the original play were written in the afterglow of idealism rewarded by the election of Obama – in fact some early drafts were set around that 2008 election, that’s how long I was writing it for,” Kirkwood explained.“There was always a tension around that idealism, but I think in the screen version there is an even greater disillusionment with the Left – with myself, too.”She added: “Similarly, the contradictions in Chinese politics have grown even more complex. Xi Jinping has been a great agent of positive change as well as an agent of corruption.”  Chimerica has been adapted from the 2013 play (Image: CHANNEL 4)Who really took the photo of Tank Man in Tiananmen Square?Although Chimerica is a fictional story, the miniseries aligns itself closely to reality.The story sits in between real-life events and fiction, picking up on pertinent themes to tell a compelling story.Lee Berger is a fictitious character but confusingly the character shares his name with South African photographer and National Geographic explorer Lee Rogers Berger.Jeff Widener is, in reality, the photojournalist who took the photo of Tank Man, which has become an iconic and enduring image of resistance across the globe. Interestingly, the image has been banned in China.Chimerica airs on Channel 4 tonight at 9pm
