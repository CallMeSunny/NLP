We can talk about whether it's going to be a square table or a round table."Then we can begin to lay out a map, a road map, of what we might be willing to work towards.

    The calls for talks without pre-conditions appears to mark a change in US rhetoric that Pyongyang would have to agree to hang up its nuclear ambitions in order for the US to agree to talks.The secretary of state also revealed the US is working to tighten its grip on North Korea by enforcing renewed international sanctions that the country’s sole ally, China, would also be a part of.Mr Tillerson added that America has laid out a variety of military options to deal with Pyongyang if the situation calls for it.The secretary of state has long called for a diplomatic resolution to tensions that have brought the US and North Korea closer to World War 3 than ever.Pyongyang’s most recent missile test, the most powerful the country has ever fired, could be a factor in Mr Tillerson’s eagerness to throw prior US requirements for talks out the window.Russia’s Foreign Minister recently claimed that North Korea was ready to engage in talks with the US on “security guarantees”, suggesting negotiations between the two could be closer than ever.

We do think they could do more with the oil.“We're really asking them to please restrain more of the oil, not cut it off completely.“That was the most effective tool the last time the North Koreans came to the table.”
