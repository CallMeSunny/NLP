Nearly every company on the FTSE suffered losses as a global sell-off continued after the arrest of a top executive from Chinese technology giant Huawei sparked fears of an escalation in the US-China trade war. The sharp drop is the biggest one-day loss since June 24, 2016 - a day after the Brexit vote - which also saw the FTSE fall by 3.15 percent.
