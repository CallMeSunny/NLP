All times BST.9.50pm: Images released of North Korea scientistsNorth Korea has released rare images of its secret scientists tasked with bringing nuclear destruction to Kim Jong-un’s Western enemies.The scientists are blacklisted across the globe but hailed as heroes in North Korea, where they are working around the clock to help make the country a nuclear superpower. Photos released just hours ahead of last weekend’s nuclear test showed Ri Hong Sop and Hong Sung Mu flanking despot Kim Jong-un as he inspected a new peanut-shaped warhead.Ri is the head of the hermit state’s Nuclear Weapons Institute while Hong is deputy director of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea's munitions industry department.8pm: Shock new map shows what would happen if North Korea attacks LondonA North Korea attack on the heart of London would utterly destroy around nine square miles of the city and instantly kill tens of thousands, according to terrifying new data provided by NukeMap.The website shows in horrifying clarity the extent to which an H-bomb attack would impact all corners of the city, which is one of the most obvious European targets for the rogue state.NukeMap claims around 130,000 people would die in the blast, with a staggering 355,000 people also sustaining injuries in the event of a hypothetical 100 kiloton H-bomb landing on Trafalgar Square. 5.00pm: Russia condemns North KoreaRussian President Vladimir Putin and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in spoke by phone on Monday and resolutely condemned North Korea over its latest nuclear test, the Kremlin said in a statement.The Kremlin said Putin had told Moon that the only way to resolve the crisis was through diplomacy and talks.Russia regarded Pyongyang's latest test as a serious threat to peace and security in the region, the Kremlin said.4.00pm: US ambassador to UN says 'enough is enough'North Korea is "begging for war", Nikki Haley said in New York this afternoon. She said: "To the members of the security council I must say: enough is enough."His abusive use of missiles and his nuclear threats show that he is begging for war. “War is never something the United States wants. We don’t want it now. But our country’s patience is not unlimited."3.00pm: Japan warns ‘we cannot waste any more time’Japan has warned the UN Security Council that “we cannot waste any more time” in punishing North Korea after its latest nuclear test."We need North Korea to feel the pressure - if they go down this road there will be consequences,” said Japanese Ambassador Koro Bessho ahead of an emergency council meeting later today.2.00pm: Putin and Xi condemn North KoreaVladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and the other leaders of the BRICS group of emerging economies are the latest to condemn North Korea’s alleged H-bomb test.Leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are attending a summit in Xiamen, southeastern China, which was designed to boost their presence on the global stage, but has been overshadowed by Kim Jong-un’s latest act of war-mongering.In a joint communique, Mr Putin and Mr Xi, along with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Brazilian President Michel Temer and South African President Jacob Zuma slammed North Korea but insisted that the tensions must only be solved through diplomatic means.1.25pm: Theresa May calls for further sanctions on North KoreaTheresa May believes that “peaceful, diplomatic means are best when dealing with North Korea”, a Downing Street spokeswoman has said.“As the Prime Minister made clear yesterday, and the Foreign Secretary made clear, our focus is on working with partners to increase pressure on North Korea and find a diplomatic solution to the crisis,” the spokeswoman told reporters.“We've condemned the test in the strongest possible terms. We are calling for tougher action to have North Korea stop this dangerous and destabilising activity.“Our focus is on how we increase pressure and come to a peaceful solution, including at the UN today... It's our view in the UK overwhelmingly that peaceful diplomatic means are best."“During her visit to Japan last week, the Prime Minister said that she wanted to look at increasing the pace of sanctions against Pyongyang.When asked if this could include an oil embargo, the spokeswoman said: “Our view is that there are further sanctions we could consider.“There are lots of additional restrictions we could look at on a range of imports and things like restrictions on North Korean workers overseas.“We expect all of that to be discussed and we will be part of that discussion.”Mrs May believes that China, Kim Jong-un’s biggest ally, could be doing more – echoing a sentiment often expressed by Donald Trump.“China has leverage over North Korea and we should be encouraging them to use that leverage to ensure North Korea stop their illegal acts. That is very much the view of the Prime Minister,” the spokeswoman said.12.45pm: Neutral Switzerland prepared to mediate between North Korea and its enemiesSwitzerland is prepared to act as mediator to help resolve tensions on the Korean peninsula, Swiss President Doris Leuthard has said.“I think it really is time for dialogue," Ms Leuthard told a news conference in Berne.“We are ready to offer our role for good services as a mediator. I think in the upcoming weeks a lot will depend on how the US and China can have an influence in this crisis. That's why I think Switzerland and Sweden can have a role behind the curtain.”Despite Switzerland famously being a neutral country, Ms Leuthard couldn’t help but sneak in a jab as Donald Trump’s love of Twitter.Discussing the hypothetical need to find a location for talks, she said: “I think that's our role to look at what kind of possibilities we find. Because, well, Twitter won't be an adequate instrument... This must be very discreet.” Related articles   North Korea 'preparing to launch ballistic missile' after nuclear test   North Korea regime needs to be OVERTHROWN, warns ex-UN ambassador 11.55am: North Korea could ‘wipe out’ US economy with EMP attackNorth Korea could use a series of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks to destroy the US economy, the BBC’s foreign affairs editor John Simpson has said.Speaking to BBC’s Radio 5 Live, he explained: “One of the things that the North Koreans have been boasting about an electromagnetic pulse (EMP), which means firing a nuclear weapon up into the atmosphere and devastating the electrical grid of a country and all of its infrastructure.“If something like that were to happen, I don’t think it is at all likely, but when North Korea is boasting about it, then, of course, the whole world would suffer if there was a major breakdown of the United States, China or somewhere else – that would be absolutely devastating to the world economy.“There are serious dangers to the world economy, and I think this is why the Chinese are showing such signs of nervousness at the moment because they think that the world economy could be devastated if anything goes wrong at all.”11.00am: Russia and China respond to TrumpRussia has warned that it would need react to the deployment of a US anti-missile system in South Korea."It inevitably will raise the question about our reaction, about our military balances," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said at a BRICS summit in China.China has said that Donald Trump’s threat to cut off trade with countries trading with North Korea is “not fair”.Mr Trump last night tweeted: “The United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea.”Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said: "What we absolutely cannot accept is that on the one hand (we are) making arduous efforts to peacefully resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, and on the other hand (our) interests are being sanctioned or harmed."This is both not objective and not fair."  REUTERSNorth Korea released images of Kim Jong-un inspecting a nuclear warhead10.00am: South Korea and US plan North Korea responseSouth Korea has said that it is talking to the US about deploying aircraft carriers and strategic bombers to the Korean peninsula.The move is a direct response to “signs” that North Korea might launch more missile tests in the wake of its sixth and largest nuclear test.9.00am: US anti-missile system to launch in South KoreaSouth Korea has confirmed that it will temporally deploy a controversial US missile defence system designed to intercept North Korean warheads.The final four of six Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) launchers will become operational in the village of Seongju after the environment ministry gave its approval.Two batteries were installed in April causing outrage among villagers, who said that radiation from the launchers would damage their health and crops.Seoul said in June that it would hold off installing the remaining components until it completed an assessment of their environmental impact, which officials have now deemed to be “minimal”.Officials have conceded that that regular radiation assessments must be observed by local residents, with results being made available to the public.China has also protested the anti-missile system, which is says “gravely harms the strategic security interests of China, Russia and other countries in the region”.

    5.30am: Boris warns Trump that North Korea strike could ‘vaporise’ SouthBoris Johnson has warned Donald Trump that a military strike on North Korea could push Kim Jong-un to “vaporise” South Korea.The Foreign Secretary said: “There is no question that this is another provocation, it is reckless, what they are doing is they seem to be moving closer towards a hydrogen bomb which, if fitted to a successful missile, would unquestionably present a new order of threat.“We have to consider how to respond and it's our view in the UK, overwhelmingly, that peaceful diplomatic means are the best.“It's certainly our view that none of the military options are good. It is of course right to say that all options are on the table, but we really don't see an easy military solution.”North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb capable of being mounted on to an intercontinental ballistic missile on Sunday.The launch marked the rogue state’s sixth and most powerful nuclear test, resulting in a magnitude 6.3 earthquake.
