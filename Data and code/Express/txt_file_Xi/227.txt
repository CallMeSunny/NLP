  GettyChris Patten took the former Hong Kong flag on Britannia as he left the former colony in 1997Chinese President Xi Jinping is visiting the former colony in an array of socialist pomp and splendour, but, shielded from his eyes, there is an anger and democratic determination which the Chinese will no doubt be censoring from its citizens.Years before July 1, 1997, Britain and China signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration which ensured Hong Kong's democracy, capitalist system and rule of law would be untouched for at least 50 years from the Handover.It was branded 'One Country, Two Systems' - plastered on adverts across the city - and in the first few years following 1997 all seemed to be just that.

    Student protest leader Joshua Wong was among the group arrested last night and is no stranger to the police and the Chinese government.Mr Wong led the near three month-long 10,000-strong Umbrella Revolution in 2014 in retaliation over Beijing threatening universal suffrage - and he is only 20-years-old.He was recognised by Fortune Magazine as one of the world's greatest leaders in 2015 and is secretary-general of Demosisto, a party he formed calling for a referendum to determine Hong Kong's sovereignty after 2047 when the Sino-British declaration ends.I was just eight-years-old when the Handover took place and remember sitting on the seawall in Hong Kong harbour, just metres away from Chris Patten, now Lord Patten of Barnes, who stepped onboard the Royal Yacht Britannia with Prince Charles and waved an emotional farewell to what is often seen as the last vestiges of the British empire.It was tipping down with rain during the ceremony which we watched on a big screen in the boatyard, hundreds of people holding back tears - perhaps pathetic fallacy.Many British, and people from all over the world, left in the year coming up to the Handover over fears China would stamp down on the democracy and one of the most pure forms of capitalism in the world which shaped Hong Kong into one of the most prosperous global cities.However, many, including my family, remained, unwilling to leave their homes, friends, way of life and businesses, and a hope "One Country, Two Systems" would flourish.But slowly and surely, China's particular brand of socialism, haunted by the Cultural Revolution and years of stamping down on everything Hongkongers hold dear, has seeped into the Hong Kong government.Hong Kong is still a flourishing, vibrant, multi-cultural city, which attracts more than 36million tourists a year, but you do not have to dig very far to realise the country is being quietly throttled by China.  GettyXi Jinping took part in a military parade in the closed off HK headquarters of the PLAGrowing up in Hong Kong, politics came into our consciousness perhaps earlier than those in the UK, especially after 1997 when everybody was so aware of the democracy we were lucky to have compared to metres over the border where parents could only have one child and did not have the freedoms we enjoyed.Political protests, always peaceful, were a common sight in Central, the financial hub of the city - and over the past 10 years they have only increased.I was told a long time ago Hong Kong had the most amount of protests a week than any other country in the world - I don't know if that was true but it was something which seemed feasible and I was proud of.  Getty26 pro-democracy protesters, including Joshua Wong (blue and white, left) were arrested last night  GettyThe Umbrella Revolution in 2014 lasted for nearly three monthsThe Handover, for many, including my friends and me, was not about Hong Kong not being British anymore, it was about democracy.Yes, we were only eight years old, but that fight for democracy all around us seeped into our consciousness whether we wanted it to or not.Protest leaders quickly realised Britain was not going to come to Hong Kong's rescue after continued calls during the 2014 mass protest for anybody from the British government to publicly speak out against the Chinese tightening grip on democratic elections were ignored.In fact, the UK's Foreign Affairs Committee in 2015 attacked the Government for its "mild response" and said the protest was "more than an abstract concern".Britain does need to do more. It cannot benefit from years of prosperity in Hong Kong, which the UK worked hard to achieve, to just let it all go over fears of upsetting China. Britain has a responsibility and it is not holding up its end of the bargain.
