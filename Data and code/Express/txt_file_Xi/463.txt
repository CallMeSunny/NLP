     In China, people have many channels to communicate, it's just that they communicate in different waysHua Chunying, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman“I guess he must have done it via wifi on a satellite network,” said a user on Weibo.Many foreigners log on to virtual private networks (VPNs) to access content hosted outside of China. Another option is to sign up for a data-roaming service before leaving one's home country.“The president will tweet whatever he wants. That's his way of communicating directly with the American people. Why not?” a White House official said ahead of Trump's arrival in Beijing on Wednesday."When asked whether China considers Mr Trump's use of Twitter to be in breach of Chinese law, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said there were many means of communication with “the outside world”.“In China, people have many channels to communicate, it's just that they communicate in different ways,” Mr Hua said at a regular ministry briefing.

In his tweet, Mr Trump embedded a link to a photograph of his Beijing visit on Instagram - also forbidden in China.Not all of Mr Trump's tweets in China were bright and cheerful. “NoKo has interpreted America's past restraint as weakness,” he tweeted about reclusive North Korea's nuclear and missile threats, going on to issue a stark warning: “This would be a fatal miscalculation. Do not underestimate us. AND DO NOT TRY US.”
