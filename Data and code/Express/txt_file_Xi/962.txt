   North Korea could still strike the United States once its military "fine-tunes" its missile arsenal capacities.Speaking to NBC News, Ms Kang said: "They are using this lull to fine-tune some technical aspects of what further provocation they might undertake."Further provocations are always possible and so we are watching very closely. But certainly, this period of lull gives us an indication that North Korea is also recalculating."  FOX NEWS/GETTYMs Kang said North Korea is using a period of international calm to fine-tune its missile arsenalNorth Korea has ignored international condemnation and continued its efforts to push forward and create a deadly arsenal of nuclear weapons.US President Donald Trump has labelled North Korea a “menace threatening the world with nuclear devastation” during his latest speech in Seoul.Mr Trump attacked the regime of despot leader Kim Jong-un and called on "all responsible nations" to unite to halt the nuclear threat from the rogue state.The US President warned North Korea against making a "fatal miscalculation" as fears of World War 3 continue to soar.

    North Korea frequently arranges its missile tests to coincide with major international meetings and the President’s visit could be the perfect opportunity for the rogue state.Joshua Pollack of RUSI said North Korea could fire the weapon in a desperate show of force against the United States and its allies.Mr Pollack said: "North Korean leadership undoubtedly feels pushed into a corner."The logical sequence of actions would be to start testing them to full range into the Pacific and then to use one for a live nuclear test if it is deemed necessary to convince America’s leaders that a new reality has emerged.
