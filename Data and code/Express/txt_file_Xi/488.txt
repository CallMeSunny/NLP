   The EU Chamber of Commerce in Beijing said members were becoming increasingly frustrated at the lack of clear information from trade officials.Chambers bosses said Beijing likes to paint itself as a victim of an unpredictable and capricious President Donald Trump but acknowledged there were two sids to the story.Chief executive Mats Harborn said: "We consider tariffs to be inappropriate remedies but this trade war is fuelled by China's reform deficit."The ball is in the court of Beijing.” Related articles   TRADE WAR WARNING: China boosts banking ties with RUSSIA   China news: Global market fears SPARKED as China issues WARNING  The ball is in the court of BeijingMats HarbornChamber members have been on tenterhooks since Mr Trump announced he was increasing his current 25 percent penalty on Chinese imports of £38,000bn ($50bn) by another 10 percent to £152bn ($200bn) worth of goods.One member said: “Everyone is pretty nervous here. We expect China to reply with retaliatory tariffs worth £45.6bn ($60bn).”Mr Trump has already threatened to increase his 10 percent punitive tariff to 25 percent by the end of 2018 if China reacts with retaliation.China has vowed to strike back on September 24 when the are tariffs come into force.
