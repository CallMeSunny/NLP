Is this deep thinking?Long YongtuHe said it was unwise to impose import duties on soybeans in retaliation for US President Donald Trump’s decision to slap additional levies on Chinese imports.Mr Long said: “Agricultural products are very sensitive in trade and soybeans are very sensitive as well.“We should have avoided targeting agricultural products because targeting agricultural products should be the last resort.“But we have targeted agricultural products, or soybeans, right from the start.”  Donald Trump and Xi Jinping (Image: GETTY)China targeted soybeans in the hope of hitting the agricultural states which form Mr Trump’s political heartland but the fall in imports from the US also led to steep domestic price hikes.Mr Long said: “China is in dire need of soybean imports, so why did we pick out soybeans from the beginning? Is this deep thinking?”Washington sparked the trade dispute in July when it imposed 25 per cent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese products, which prompted China to slap a similar levy on the same amount of US goods.Mr Trump ramped up the pressure in September by slapping 10 per cent tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese imports and has warned that these will rise to 25 per cent from January if Beijing refuses to change its trade practices.

Negotiators from both sides are preparing for fresh trade talks and Mr Long said he was “cautiously optimistic” about a resolution because Mr Trump’s tariffs have also hurt US interests.He said: “To some extent, I like Trump’s character.“I hope the trade talks can have a good result.”
