    The incident comes as the world watches North Korea's participation in the Winter Olympics, hosted by South Korea, in a diplomatic push by Kim Jong Un's isolated regime.All UN member states are prohibited from facilitating or engaging in ship-to-ship transfers of goods to or from North Korean-flagged vessels.It is just one in a series of UN Security Council sanctions Pyongyang is subject to.The previous incidents reported by Japan this year both involved North Korean tanker Rye Song Gang 1 - one of the vessels denied international port access by the Security Council.   Following the news, three sources have reported that Japan plans to buy at least 20 additional F-35A stealth fighters over the next six years, some or all of which it may purchase directly from Lockheed Martin Corp in the United States rather than assemble locally.A source with knowledge of the plan said: "In view of budgets and production schedules a new acquisition of around 25 planes is appropriate.”The sources said buying complete aircraft from the United States, at about $100million each, will save Japan roughly $30million per airframe.The purchase will add to an earlier order for 42 of the fighters, most of which are being constructed at a "final assembly and check out" plant in Japan operated by the country's leading defence contractor - Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.  GETTYJapan's Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said they are 'evaluating what fighter aircraft we need'As North Korea pushes ahead with its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programmes, adding F-35s will further increase Japan's reliance on US military technology to give it an edge over potential antagonists in East Asia.When asked whether Japan planned to buy more F-35s, Japanese Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera said: "We have not yet made any plan and we are evaluating what fighter aircraft we need.”
