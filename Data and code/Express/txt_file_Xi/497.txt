As I understand it, there is a lot of Chinese state money behind this potential deal.“They do not allow us to invest in their economy in the same way. We have been far too generous in the past.”  GETTYThere are concerns the British Government is allowing China too much powerHe went on to urge the Government to be “firmer” and drew parallels with the failure to stop the Stock Exchange being taken over by the GermansLiberal Democrat Leader Tim Farron has waded-in on the debate, saying the Government is totally incorrect in its handling of China gas bid.

    National Grid said: “We will not speculate on the identity of potential bidders. Regardless of their identity, all bidders will have to go through the same rigorous approval process. The new owner will have to be approved by regulators and operate under the relevant requirements.“Networks are subject to strict rules and criteria in terms of security, reliability and availability and any buyer will need to prove to Ofgem and the Government that they can meet these criteria.”It is believed a gas deal involving the Chinese would be subject to additional safeguards, with a Government source telling the Mail that there is “a robust regulatory system in place”.
