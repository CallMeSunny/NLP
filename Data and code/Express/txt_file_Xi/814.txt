   During a visit to London and the House of Commons, former US ambassador to the UN John Bolton told officials the CIA has warned the US President America could soon be within striking distance from Pyongyang missiles, according to the Guardian.The March deadline, was also mentioned to a former European parliamentarian by a senior US commander a few days ago at Panmunjom on Korea’s demilitarised zone, which separates the North from the South.Mr Bolton, who served under George W Bush, has recently been giving a series of warnings during appearances on US TV networks.During an interview on Fox News at the end of last month, he warned that diplomatic options were running out after North Korea fired a new kind of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and Kim claimed the Hwasong-15 can be armed with a nuclear warhead and could strike the United States mainland.  Getty/EPACIA heads have told Donald Trump he has a three month window to stop Kim Jong-un's missile programmeMr Bolton said this test-launch was "significant" because, if the early estimates are confirmed, it leaves no doubt that Pyongyang is "getting very close" to being able to threaten the US with a nuclear attack. He said: ”You have to ask when we're going to start seriously considering a military option.“There is no time for this [sanctions] to have impact. Look, if the State Department is still focused on sanctions, then I will guarantee you. I’ll bet the ranch right now North Korea will have deliverable nuclear weapons.“The one diplomatic play that’s left here is with China. Presumably, the president delivered that message, which should be something like, Look Xi Jinping, we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way.

The Chinese policy is simply to contain the problem over North Korea, not to resolve it.  AFPNorth Korean dictator Kim Jong-un“But why would they want to do that?
