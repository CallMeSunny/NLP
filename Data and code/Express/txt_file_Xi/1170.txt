   Peskov also insisted that “the Syrian army doesn’t have chemical weapons,” saying this had been “observed and confirmed by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, a special UN unit.”The US air strikes on Syria have been blasted by the Russian foreign ministry, which has called for an emergency meeting of the UN security council.It claims that it is obvious that the US strike was prepared before the alleged chemical attack in Idlib. It has suspended air safety agreement with the USA.According to the head of the Defence Committee in the Russian upper house of parliament, Trump's strikes will “undermine efforts to fight terror” in the country.Speaking hours after US missile destroyers fired 59 Tomahawk missiles on a Syrian airbase, Viktor Ozerov said the Kremlin are now seeking an urgent UN Security Council meeting to quell tensions.Ozerov said: “This could be viewed as an act of aggression of the US against a UN nation,” according to local media reports.Hours before the strikes, a Russian official warned Trump to avoid launching a strike against Bashar al-Assad’s regime or they could face “negative consequences”.

Security Council."Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman said today it was necessary to enforce a no-fly zone and create safe zones in Syria without delay, calling U.S. missile strikes against a Syrian air base a positive response to "war crimes"."The destruction of Sharyat airbase marks an important step to ensure that chemical and conventional attacks against the civilian population do not go unpunished," spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said in a written statement.China today said it was urgent to prevent a further deterioration in the situation in Syria after a U.S. military strike on a Syrian government airfield.Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China called on all relevant parties to stick to political settlements.She made the comments during a regular briefing when asked about the U.S. strike, which came as China's President Xi Jinping was attending a summit in Florida with U.S. President Donald Trump.More to follow…
