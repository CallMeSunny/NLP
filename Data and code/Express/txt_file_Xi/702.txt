  Xi Jinping's China is set to overtake Donald Trump's US by 2032, the report says (Image: GETTY)The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) report suggested in the race to outpace developed economies, emerging countries such as China, India, and Brazil suffered a setback this year and will outgrow them later than previously expected, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said. But in China’s case, it will still overtake the US in 13 years, the study has predicted. The consultancy's 2019 World Economic League Table was more downbeat on the global economy in comparison with last year's outlook.The report, which forecast the fortunes of 193 countries to 2033, states: "For the medium term, we are roughly as optimistic as we were a year ago, but suspect the route to growth will be more bumpy than we had assumed 12 months ago.”US President Mr Trump threw down the gauntlet earlier this year after slapping tariffs on imports of 25 percent and ten percent on imports of Chinese steel and aluminium, triggering a series of tit-for-tat measures which some analysts will lead to a trade dispute which could last two decades.China is hit top spot in its ”league table” in 2032, two years later than previously expected, due to a more lax monetary policy and lower exchange rate, the CEBR said.The effects of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies have made themselves felt across global markets this year, and dented world trade growth.

In addition, the CEBR expects Brazil to overtake Italy in 2020, not 2018.India will overtake Britain and France, probably in 2019, but possibly 2020, rather than in 2018 as it predicted a year ago.Britain would temporarily lose its place as then the sixth biggest economy to France next year due to Brexit-related disruption, but will bounce back rapidly.The forecasts chimed with a deepening sense that optimism about synchronised global growth was overcooked, and that markets got ahead of themselves.A Reuters poll of economists in late October signalled the outlook for global growth in 2019 dimmed for the first time.
