    “The North Korean regime has pursued its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in defiance of every assurance, agreement and commitment it has made to the United States and its allies.“It’s broken all of those commitments.“After promising to freeze its plutonium programme in 1994 it repeated the benefits of the deal and then immediately continued its illicit nuclear activities.Chinese TV cuts out of @POTUS remarks temporarily, saying "unfortunately we lost the feed."— Steve Herman (@W7VOA) November 9, 2017“In 2005 after years of diplomacy the dictatorship agreed to ultimately abandon its nuclear programmes and return to the treaty on non-proliferation, but it never did and worst it tested the very weapons it said it was going to give up.”Trump emphasised that the US refuses to be “blackmailed or attacked” and sent a stern warning to Pyongyang that previous regimes that have failed to comply with American rhetoric have been “discarded”.He added: “America does not seek conflict or confrontation, but we will never run from it.  GETTYThe Republican firebrand stated that he gave China 'great credit' for taking advantage of the US“History is filled with discarded regimes that have foolishly tested America’s resolve.“Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States should look to our past and you will doubt it no longer.“We will not permit America or our allies, to be blackmailed or attacked. We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.  GETTYThe interruption came during the speech in which the US President was praising the country“We will not be intimidated and we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.”Trump also stated that the “three largest aircraft carriers in the world are appropriately positioned" to defend themselves in the event of a provocation from the rogue state.”The USS Nimitz, USS Ronald Reagan and USS Theodore Roosevelt all find themselves tasked with keeping tabs on any future provocation attempts from the hermit kingdom - it is the first time three US carrier strike forces are operating in the Pacific for a decade.
