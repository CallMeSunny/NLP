GETTYMrs May's jibe at doom mongers was being seen last night as a swipe at former George OsborneMrs May's jibe at doom mongers was being seen as a swipe at former Tory chancellor George Osborne, who spearheaded the "Project Fear" drive to raise alarm about potential economic calamity outside the EU.Her remarks followed a series of encouraging economic figures including record levels on the Stock Exchange and, in the last week, a record improvement in manufacturing figures and a massive fall in workless household figures down by 200,000.Hopes for the economic outlook were further boosted when a leading employers' organisation reported growing confidence in UK industry.The EEF, which represents manufacturing employers, published research predicting growing output and orders in the coming months.Meanwhile, another economic survey to be published later this week was expected to show that Britain will avoid a recession next year.   "Now I’m not going to pretend it will be plain sailing."There’ll be some difficult times ahead."Obviously we will be looking ahead to an Autumn Statement, so in terms of how we’re going to position things, more detail will be coming out there."What I’m clear about is that I’m going to continue as we have done in a government over the last six years ensuring that we’re a country that can live within our needs."She added: "In the conversations I have had with businesses, both big and small, since the referendum decision, many who probably would have campaigned to stay in the European Union – there’s a real sense of - let’s get on with it."We’ve had the decision, let’s get on with it, let’s make a success of it and a real sense of optimism and that’s what we had around the Cabinet table this week as well."The Remain campaign had claimed that a vote to Leave the EU would cost each household £4,300 and force an emergency “punishment” Budget with £30 billion of cuts and tax rises.The new Prime Minister, who was attending her first major international summit since taking office, re-emphasised her commitment to launch talks for new trade deals.

It was also seen as a dig at Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who was also travelling on the official Government jet to the gathering of world leaders in Hangzhou.He was seated a few yards away in the aircraft as the Prime Minister spoke to reporters.She said: "We’ve seen figures giving some different messages in relation to the economy and I think the reaction of the economy has been better than some had predicted post the referendum.She wanted to make clear that Britain was “open for business as a bold, confident, outward looking country.”And arriving in Hangzhou, she declared that under her Premiership Britain will be a “champion of global free trade.”    reaction of the economy [to Brexit] has been better that some have predictedTheresa MayWith a series of top level bilateral meetings planned with US President Barack Obama, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Modi and the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, she plans to push for new trade deals for Britain free of EU control.Her remarks about business "optimism" were backed up by the EEF, which forecast growth would return to manufacturing output at the end of the year.Exports were more positive on the back of stronger demand from the EU and United States, the manufacturers' group said.  GETTYMs May is to hold a series of top bilateral meetings with figures including Malcolm Turnbull Chief economist at EEF Lee Hopley said: "Manufacturers' confidence collapsed in the aftermath of the EU referendum, but our latest survey provides some relief that this has corrected."Ms Hopley added: "Signs of an export revival are helping to drive more optimism about activity in the second half of the year, but concerns about whether the UK economy can shrug off post-referendum challenges is clearly evident."These risks are expected to hit some sectors, such as with industries linked to investment goods and construction, harder than others. Despite the short-term outlook for manufacturing remaining broadly stable, the continued downward slide in investment plans should keep policymakers alive to the potential risks facing the sector."Tom Lawton, of BDO Manufacturing, which helped with the study, added: "While the outlook for the UK economy remains uncertain, manufacturers are more confident about their own business performance. This shows they believe there is a positive way forward from here and that Brexit might not have been the portent of recession."  GETTYMrs May took her swipe at 'Project Fear' during her flight to the G20 Summit in China, yesterdayOn her flight to China, Mrs May also insisted that the controversy over the £18 billion Hinkley Point nuclear power station, which would be funded by China will not be resolved this weekend.Mrs May delayed a decision over whether to go ahead with the project soon after taking office amid suggestions she does not trust the Chinese.She avoided answering whether she does trust the Chinese when it was put to her by journalists.She said: “Of course we have a relationship with them, we will work with them.”And she said China and the French Government, whose public sector company EDF will build the power station, will have to wait.She said: “I actually look at the evidence and the advice and then consider that.”But emphasising her priorities for trade partnerships, she said: “I very much want to give the message that Britain is open for business.“We are a bold confident outward looking country, we want to talk about the opportunities for free trade around the world.”She said she plans to use the conference to “talk to other world leaders about the opportunities in Britain.”She added: “We will unashamedly be proponents of free trade and out there explaining the benefits of it.”As Brexit became a key talking point at the G20 summit, the Japanese government claimed the UK's withdrawal from the EU could have an impact on Japanese firms operating in the UK.The Tokyo government published a list of demands aimed at protecting the country's car manufacturers and financial institutions and jobs of Britons working for Japanese firms.The 15-page ministry of foreign affairs document, based on requests from Japanese firms, urged Theresa May's Government to behave in a "responsible manner".The official report said: "In light of the fact that a number of Japanese businesses, invited by the Government in some cases, have invested actively to the UK, which was seen to be a gateway to Europe, and have established value-chains across Europe, we strongly request that the UK will consider this fact seriously and respond in a responsible manner to minimise any harmful effects on these businesses."The document also warns that head offices of Japanese firms in the UK could be shifted to the continent if EU regulations no longer apply after Brexit.
