    var brightcoveBrandsafety='' The China trade war with the USA has escalated in recent days, with both countries announcing new tariffs on each other’s goods. US president Donald Trump repeatedly stated China will pay these taxes, but his economic advisor has said US firms will pay the tariffs for any goods brought in from China. The President has claimed the trade war between America and China is a positive business move and will generate billions of dollars for the US Treasury. As the trade war between the two superpower nations has intensified, what actually are the new tariffs?

They are essentially border taxes charged on foreign imports.Importers pay these applicable charges at the point of entry to the customs agency of the country or entity that is imposing them.The purpose of tariffs is to increase the price of foreign goods for the consumer, and make domestic produce comparatively cheaper, with the aim of encouraging domestic production.  China trade war: US president Donald Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping (Image: GETTY)Why is Donald Trump using tariffs to target China?Donald Trump believes China is using unfair trade practices to gain an advantage over the USA.He has accused China of stealing and abusing the intellectual property rights of American firms, and of subsidising steel exports, which is essentially selling a product at an artificially low price to drive down competitor prices.President Trump is also sensitive about the size of the US trade deficit, which is the amount by which the cost of a country’s imports exceeds the value of its exports.China is a manufacturing juggernaut and holds enormous power in the global economy.By comparison, the USA is unable to supply at the same levels as the country demands and, therefore, a large trade deficit exists for the country.
