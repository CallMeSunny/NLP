  EPARhinos face being wiped out by the ruling by the South African judgeRhinos took another step towards extinction today when a judge ruled that a ban on trading their precious horns is illegal.Conservationists have recoiled at the decision by the South African judge, warning that getting rid of the moratorium will push the imperiled creatures closer to the brink.Judge Francis Legodi lifted South Africa’s domestic sales ban after ruling that the government had failed to consult the public when imposing the moratorium in 2009. He  highlighted the way rhino poaching has soared to record levels since the ban had come into effect in his judgement.Up to 1,200 rhinos were slaughtered in South Africa last year, and 2015 figures show little sign that the killing is abating.At the end of August, 749 rhinos had been poached, 544 of the protected animals inside the famous Kruger National Park. During the same period in 2014, 716 had been poached countrywide with 459 massacred in the KNP.Poachers have been turning the bush country into a bloody shambles to get their hands on a  substance comprised of the same material as toe nails but which is hailed as a magical cure for cancer in the Far East.  EPARhinos are facing a grim futureBlack market Rhino horn is worth the same price as cocaine, selling at more than £40,000 a kilo, and only taking a few bullets from a poacher’s Kalashnikov to make him rich beyond dreams.Two South African game breeders launched today’s legal challenge, saying they had a constitutional right to sell rhino horn, describing it as a renewable resource.In a 39-page ruling at the in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria, Judge Legodi, agreed, asking: “What disastrous implications would be brought about by the immediate lifting of the moratorium? I cannot think of any.”Conservationists responded immediately.Philip Mansbridge, UK director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), said: “The question has to be asked: ‘Who is going to buy rhino horn in South Africa?’ This is all part of a bigger campaign to push for international trade and is driven purely by the economic motives of a few who wish to trade rhino horn.

    “At a time when rhinoceros are being slaughtered at an unprecedented rate for their horns, this legal bid by a small group that stand to benefit directly from the international sale of rhino horn should be condemned.“This is not a challenge based on the need to conserve and protect rhino; that is a fallacious and disingenuous argument. It is a challenge driven purely by economic incentives and it is the rhino that would pay the ultimate price.”His comments were echoed by IFAW’s Southern Africa director Jason Bell, who  added: “The rhino breeders have won round one, but we can only hope that the findings of the government’s Committee of Inquiry into the possibility of international trade in rhino horn will find against the notion of trade and that the Minister of the Environment will launch an appeal against today’s ruling.”Allison Thomson, founder of Outraged SA Citizens Against Poaching, went on to warn: “South Africa does not have a market for rhino horn domestically and the opening of trade locally will only lead to the smuggling of rhino horn by criminal syndicates into the black market in Vietnam and China.” Related articles   Savage killing of 60 tigers and rhinos in 10 DAYS: Shock pics of...   Top ten facts about rhinoceroses Lawyers from South Africa’s environment agency are studying the ruling.The case was brought by game breeders John Hume and Johan Kruger. After the ruling, Hume's lawyer GH Heyns said: “It is a total success. Factually, it is legal to trade rhino horns in South Africa There is no moratorium in place.”South Africa has around 20,000 rhinos, 80 per cent of the global population. Since 1997, there has been an international ban on trading their horn but South Africa’s domestic moratorium only came into placed six years ago.The last few months have seen a global groundswell to protect endangered rhinos as well as elephants from the ravages of the ivory trade.Prince William has championed the animals’ cause and President Barack Obama and China’s Xi Jinping agreed historic measures to protect the animals from wildlife trade earlier this autumn.Last night WWF applauded the South African government’s decision to appeal the lifting of the domestic ban on trading rhino horn.Warning that the court’s decision means it now possible to buy rhino horn in the country, Dr Colman O Criodain, WWF wildlife trade policy analyst, said: “It is hard to see any positive conservation benefits from this court ruling, particularly at a time when rhino poaching figures are at record highs.“There is no domestic demand for rhino horn in South Africa, so it is inconceivable that anyone would buy it – unless they intend to sell it abroad illegally or they are speculating that international trade will be legalised.“We welcome the Minister’s prompt decision to appeal today’s High Court decision as this will help to minimise the fall-out from this ruling. Reopening the national rhino horn trade will make it even harder for already overstretched law enforcement agents to tackle record rhino poaching.”And Born Free Foundation President, Will Travers OBE, said: “Rhinos are threatened by poaching for their horns across their remaining African and Asian range. South Africa has the majority of the world’s rhinos, but by no means all.“Legalising trade in rhino horn, at either a domestic or an international level, sends a message to consumers that rhino horn is a legitimate product and will inevitably lead to increased demand, incentivising further poaching. Trading in horn will not save rhinos – it could hasten their extinction.“South Africa does not exist in isolation, and the decisions it makes will have repercussions in other rhino range countries in Africa and Asia which are struggling to protect their remaining rhinos. Leading international economists and conservation experts agree that the markets for rhino horn are highly unpredictable, and that legalising the trade would be a huge risk, one that will be very difficult to reverse should it prove disastrous – as I predict it will.“This decision, which seems to be based on the desire of private rhino owners to make a lot of money by selling their stocks of rhino horn, puts all of Africa and Asia’s remaining rhinos at even greater jeopardy. We urge the South African authorities to appeal the judgement and desist from any further efforts to legalise rhino horn trade.”
