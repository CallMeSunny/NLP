  GETTYThe Calais migrants attempts are becoming more brazenWith schoolchildren on half term this week this is a real worry for any families planning to spend a few days in France.For the hauliers who have to use Calais on a regular basis it is of daily concern. Over the summer we saw miles of lorries queueing on the motorway as the migrants brought ferry services to a standstill.This cost drivers a fortune in wasted time and ruined goods. When they eventually made it across the Channel they were forced to run a gauntlet of fear as migrants tried to smash their way on to their vehicles. This cost drivers a fortune in wasted time and ruined goodsFor these truckers the situation has hardly improved in the months since. Chief executive of the Road Haulage Association Richard Burnett has warned that the threat to drivers is on the increase and that they "can't go on like this".He is absolutely right. These drivers are vital to the smooth running of our economy. It is scandalous that the French failure to provide adequate security is preventing them from going about their business.Theresa May must do more to fight their corner.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  GETTYChinese leader Xi Jinping has said he would like to see Britain remain in the EU Related articles   You cannot have human rights on the battlefield   We welcome Chinese elite but can still criticise them Mind your own businessTHE Government's attempts to foster ties with China deserve our support. It is only right that politicians try to encourage more foreign investment and greater trade opportunities. However this does not give President Xi the right to comment on our affairs.The Chinese leader has said that he wants to see Britain remain a member of the EU. He should keep his nose out of it. This is an issue for the British people to decide and with our referendum on the way it is a question that we are more than capable of answering for ourselves.  GETTYStudies reveal that we should go to sleep at 10.37pm for a perfect night's sleepNo doubt he has enjoyed the hospitality laid on for him by David Cameron and George Osborne but he should not help them strong arm us into voting in favour of the EU.There are enough unelected leaders in Brussels telling us what to do without China's dictator getting involved as well.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The times are changingACCORDING to a new study, for a perfect night's sleep we need to go to bed at 10.37pm and wake up at 7.19am. Well, most of the time. The clocks go back tonight so anybody wanting to stick to the formula will have to adjust the timings. But whatever you decide to do this weekend enjoy your extra hour.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
