       On day one of the couple’s visit to the country, Brigitte made waves as she touched down in the country with her choice of jacket - a bold red, double-breasted overcoat. Red symbolises good luck in China, so Brigitte was obviously hoping to sprinkle some positive energy on her trip with her choice.
