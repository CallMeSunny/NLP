 Xi Jinping looks set to become re-elected as President at the end of the Communist Party summit, after giving a three and a half hour speech to Congress vowing to build the nation as a “modern socialist country” and refuse to use the political systems of other countries.The Congress is used to decide the party’s five-year plan for policy and is usually the time they decide on a new leader.But Xi Jinping, who has made himself appear as a voice of stability amid international chaos, could instead leave with more influence.Analysts are awaiting moves from within the Congress that show President Xi consolidate even more power after removing his rivals from office on charges of “corruption”.  EPAXi may use the conference to ensure he can stay on past the limit of his secoThere is speculation he may use the conference to ensure he can stay on past the limit of his second term, which would end in 2022.He could also be “crowned” in the party's constitution and be bestowed the title of "lingxiu", or leader.The title was used by Mao Zedong, as well as briefly by his short-lived successor Hua Guofeng.The crowning of a leader has only been used in relation to the political schools of philosophy Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory. Dang Xiaoping oversaw the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.Related articles   US warship 'carries out threatening manoeuvres near Chinese islands' In his lengthy speech, President Xi said: "Through a long period of hard work, socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, this is a new historical direction in our country's development”He added: "We should not just mechanically copy the political systems of other countries.”The Chinese premier's show of strength in Beijing comes as US President Trump is quickly losing power to the Chinese leader, primarily because of his own inconsistency over policy and isolation from the world.

    Hundreds of senior posts at the State Department remain empty with 48 ambassadorships and 21 assistant secretary positions unfilled.And massive cuts proposed by Secretary Tillerson would slash the Foreign Service and dramatically reduce America's foreign aid, decimating their stance on the world stage.At the same time as the State Department cuts, Mr Trump requested £41billion in additional defence spending - equaling the entirety of the State Department budget.A former Obama-era senior official told The New Yorker: "All of our tools right now are military. When all of your tools are military, those are the tools you reach for."He also slammed it as an empty show of strength. Speaking on CNBC, former US Treasury official Scott Morris said the president’s “America first” stance was isolating the nation from the world and turning people towards China.He said: “It is this administration seeking to pull away from multilateral agreements, multilateral institutions. It is damaging. I think, first and foremost, it is damaging for the United States.”  GETTYThe Congress is used to decide the party’s five-year plan for policyThis is in comparison to President Xi Jinping’s statement in his speech in Beijing yesterday that China supports an open world economy and pledged further liberalisation of its market to foreign investors.Former Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns told The New Yorker: “We can shape things, or wait to get shaped by China and everybody else.” Rumours of Russian collusion in the US election and President Trump’s infantile and potentially dangerous war of words with Kim Jong-un on Twitter have also sparked fears The Donald is losing his grip on control in the White House.Officials in China have stopped working with the US Embassy on North Korea, an American official told business insider, because "Why call the Embassy when the only thing that matters is what the President tweets?"The Chinese Congress continues alongside a nationwide propaganda effort in the communist nation.Beijing has been covered in security while state-controlled media has kicked into overdrive in support of Xi’s rule.Meanwhile, China's top social media platform told their 960 million users that due to "system maintenance" they would be unable to modify profile pictures, nicknames and taglines until the end of the month in an apparent move to crush dissenting voices online.The disabled features are sporadically used by Chinese citizens to show solidarity for popular social and political causes.Related articles   US 'damaged trust with China by deploying anti-North Korea missiles'  Chinese military clamp down hard on masturbating recruits  Foreign aid splashed on helping Chinese factory workers quit smoking
