We cannot stand by while the steel industry across Europe, not just in the UK, faces such unprecedented challenges."There are no straightforward solutions to the complex global challenges but the UK government wants to work with the EU and our European partners to do all we can to support our steel industry."Mr Javid has also been in negotiations with the commission on speeding up work to approve the UK's Energy Intensive Industries (EII) compensation scheme, which could benefit steelmakers.Business Minister Anna Soubry told MPs: "I think safeguarding, which is what we call the nuclear option, is certainly one of the options that we are at least considering."But Ms Soubry also admitted that David Cameron's talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping over steel dumping were unlikely to have achieved anything "tangible".Britain recently rolled out the red carpet for Mr Xi on his state visit, despite the country's policy on steel exports.Chancellor George Osborne said the visit meant that the UK could question the Chinese about their production and "how that's distorting world prices", while Mr Cameron raised the issue during talks in Downing Street.The select committee's Labour chairman Iain Wright asked Ms Soubry: "Did the Prime Minister achieve anything?"She replied: "Yes. He raised it with the Chinese." Related articles   Volkswagen owners could get £3000 or more in compensation from...   British Army and Navy vehicles to be built using FOREIGN steel as...
