   Mr Mattis is in Vietnam for talks aimed at bolstering military ties between Washington and Hanoi, which has its own territorial claims in the South China Sea.He said US officials were “highly concerned” about China’s “predatory behaviour” and also accused Beijing of deliberately piling debt on smaller countries to pay for Chinese-backed infrastructure projects.Mr Mattis said: “We remain highly concerned with the continued militarisation of features in the South China Sea.“We look at the — what we consider to be almost predatory, in some cases certainly predatory — economic behaviour of China which is encouraging smaller countries to pile on massive debt that fiscal analysis would say they are going to have difficulty, at best, repaying."
