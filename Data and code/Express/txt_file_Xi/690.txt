We are willing to use the greatest sincerity and expend the greatest hard work to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification.However, he added: “We do not promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option to use all necessary measures” to achieve such a goal and prevent Taiwan independence.” Related articles   World War 3: Putin’s ‘tolerance warfare’ could spark huge confrontaion   World War 3: China warns the US to stay out of Taiwan   The Bashi Channel separates Taiwan from the Philippines in the South (Image: Google)Prior to this, in October 2019, he ordered military commanders responsible for monitoring the South China Sea and Taiwan to “prepare for war”.The mainland’s Taiwan Affairs Office has also warned Taiwan would face a “dead end” if it refused to recognise the 1992 consensus, an understanding that the two sides are part of one China but which leaves room for different interpretations of what the policy means in practice.Speaking after Xi’s speech in January, Tsai called on the “international community” to support Taiwan.She warned if it did not do so “we might have to ask which country might be next?”   The fact the planes were spotted in the Bashi Channel underlines China’s increasing boldness, and possibly indicates a closer relationship with the Philippines, whose controversial President Rodrigo Duterte hosted a visit from Xi in November, and who declared in 2016 China was “already in possession” of the South China Sea.In its annual strategic study 2018, published in November, London-based think tank the International Institute for International Studies warned China, like Russia, was engaged in what it termed “tolerance warfare” aimed at testing the boundaries as it pushes its expansionist agenda and continues its military build-up in the South China Sea.The report, edited by Dr Nicholas Redman, said: “The very assertive effort by China to militarise many of the islands, and their direct or implied military threats to other states who might seek, alone, to explore for natural resources in adjacent waters, has served to intimidate neighbours in the South China Sea and tame their ambitions.”It added: “This approach extends to companies internationally who may not use the appropriate nomenclature for Taiwan.”
