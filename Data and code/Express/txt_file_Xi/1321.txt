  GETTYDonald Trump has been described as a dangerous madman who is a threat to world peace and prosperityIf you listen to millions of American voters he is the only presidential candidate who can save their country from decline and assert Uncle Sam’s voice in the world again.Such a yawning chasm in opinion is unusual, even in the madcap world of American politics.Related articles   Mitt Romney criticises Trump and warns of 'improvident choices' Experience tells us that no politicians are ever as good or as bad as they’re painted so it’s important when analysing The Donald to retain a sense of proportion.He isn’t the Devil incarnate, nor is he the next Hitler (although 17 million Germans voted for Hitler) – but he isn’t Mother Teresa either.  GETTYHe is simply a man with a vision that appeals to vast numbers in the StatesHe is simply a man with a vision that appeals to vast numbers in a country which has lost its way.It might seem strange that a billionaire who owns the 58-storey Trump Tower on New York’s prestigious Fifth Avenue can resonate so profoundly with builders, truckers and small-business owners. There wealth is not something to be despised or scorned, as it can often be in this country, but something that is sought after and applaudedOn the face of it he has nothing in common with them. But that is to misunderstand the character and the culture of America.There wealth is not something to be despised or scorned, as it can often be in this country, but something that is sought after and applauded.One of The Donald’s trump cards, if you will forgive the pun, is the economy – what he calls Trumponomics.In the finest traditions of the Republican Party he would take an axe to tax.  GETTYHe also taps into the Google/ Amazon/Apple issue which angers votersHe promises to stop 75 million households paying tax at all, there would be a top rate of 25 per cent for high earners and no business – from corner store to global conglomerate – would pay more than 15 per cent.What’s not to like? He also taps into the Google/ Amazon/Apple issue which angers voters here by offering incentives to big companies who take back to America the $2.5billion in cash they currently hold abroad and pay tax on it.He also wants China to be charged for exporting to the US. Billionaire New York investor Carl Icahn applauds his forthright campaign.“Donald is what this country needs,” he says. “Donald is speaking out, he’s saying we’ve got to do something, we’ve got to help the little guy.”Trump has a remarkable ability seen in few politicians: like Nigel Farage he delivers a simple message which people get… that cheap labour provided by illegal immigrants plus mountains of imports from abroad add up to huge profits for multinational companies but lower wages for home-born workers.Left-wing intellectuals may not like it but this Trump rallying call goes down a storm.When he boasts of building a wall across the border with Mexico he’s not being a racist but a realist.  GETTYTrump has the “us” on his side because he speaks their language and they trust himAnd everyone who’s on the scrapheap or who is struggling to avoid it knows there is truth in the message. Maybe his solution is wacky. But his analysis of the symptoms is correct.In America today the official estimate is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants, about half of them Mexican.Trump says the number is 30 million – and most commentators say the truth lies somewhere in the middle.As we’ve seen to our cost in Britain, illegal immigrants (and legals from poor EU countries) will work for peanuts just to survive.In America the average household income was $58,000 (£41,100) in 1999 and adjusted for inflation it has now slipped to $53,657 (£38,000).America is going nowhere for its middle class citizens because they no longer have the power to push for pay rises. Someone else will always do the job cheaper.That’s why Trump rails against Ford building factories in Mexico or IT workers from Disney being displaced by foreigners they are forced to train.British politicians who mock his idea of a wall keeping Mexicans out should consider what Hungary has done with a barbed wire blockade across the EU and tell us how that’s any different.Trump is branded dangerous by some because he promises to “kick the ****” out of the so-called Islamic State.But how does that differ from what RAF bombs are doing in Syria, Iraq and Libya?When Trump floated the idea that temporarily no more Muslims should be allowed into America, he was widely condemned in the UK.Labour’s shadow home affairs minister Jack Dromey, husband of Harriet Harman, said Trump should be “not allowed within 1,000 miles of these shores”.But incredibly Dromey admitted he wouldn’t ban Vladimir Putin of Russia, President Xi Jinping of China or Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.Nor would he ban King Salman of Saudi Arabia, whose country had beheaded 50 people the week before. Clearly one law for the rich and another for the rancid. Many people treat as laughable the attack on Trump by Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton that he is “trying to divide America between us and them”.As a super-rich and hugely powerful woman of privilege Clinton is as much one of “them” as Trump.The only difference is that Trump has the “us” on his side because he speaks their language and they trust him.No one trusts the Clintons. Will Donald J Trump become the 45th president of the United States when the nation votes on November 3?Mexicans certainly think so… since October another 150,000 have been arrested at the border trying to sneak in before that wall becomes reality. Would it work at Dover?
