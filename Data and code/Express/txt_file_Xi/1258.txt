Missile test failure is no reason to get rid of Trident, argues Ross Clark

   As Mrs Thatcher discovered when she was harangued by a lady from Gloucestershire during the 1983 general election campaign it is never worth trying to be evasive when you are asked to confirm a detail widely suspected to be true. What people remembered from the encounter was Mrs Thatcher’s shiftiness in refusing to acknowledge that the Belgrano had been sailing away from the Falklands, not her subsequent robust defence of the sinking in which she made the point that the ship was in an exclusion zone and was therefore a danger to Royal Navy vessels whichever direction in which it happened to be heading at the time.Downing Street yesterday confirmed what was already clear from Theresa May’s performance on Sunday: that at the time the Commons held a vote on renewing Trident last July, the Prime Minister knew about the malfunction during the testing of an unarmed Trident missile a few weeks earlier.What she should have said is: yes, I did know. But so what? In no sense does a failed missile test undermine the case for renewing Trident.

There cannot be a machine in the world which has functioned perfectly first time without any need for some form of adjustment. The case for renewing Trident is strong. Theresa May should have no hesitation in continuing to make that caseObviously, in the case of a nuclear weapon the consequences of any malfunction are potentially cataclysmic. That is why the missile was equipped with a small explosive charge which was used to destroy it as soon as the navigational error became apparent.Quite rightly people will want to ask: what else is in place to ensure that a malfunction does not turn into a catastrophe? We need to be reassured, for example, that systems are in place to ensure that a nuclear warhead cannot be activated unless operators on the ground are 100 per cent sure that the missile on which it is installed is heading for its correct target.   REUTERSTheresa May failed to answer Andrew Marr's straightforward questions  10 facts about Trident nuclear weapons Wed, July 20, 2016As MPs vote to renew the UK's Trident weapons system, we look at the facts about the nuclear weapon.

    However effective the failsafe mechanisms in a Trident missile you can be sure that those installed in Trident’s replacement will – with the benefit of 30 years of technological advance – be far better. Yet no amount of testing or reassurance will please Jeremy Corbyn and the rest of the unilateral disarmament lobby. They are against Britain possessing nuclear weapons and that is that. They are insistent on this even if other countries do retain nuclear arms.What those opposed to the renewal of Trident need to answer is this: why do you think the world would be a better place if Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jong Un had their finger on the nuclear trigger but Theresa May did not? It is not a good enough answer to argue that no enemy would ever launch a nuclear attack on us unless provoked by the threat of being attacked with nuclear weapons themselves. That is just wishful thinking.   GETTYThe Government's case for renewing Trident is strongWhat is clear is that any enemy power which dared to attack Britain with nuclear weapons would – so long as the missiles functioned properly on the day – face instant retaliation. The threat of mutually assured destruction is surely the best guard we have against nuclear war but it is one which would be fatally undone by unilateral disarmament. True, a nuclear deterrent does not come cheap. The estimate of the costs for Trident’s replacement is £31billion. It is very tempting to think we could get away without spending this money and hope that we can rely on America.However we can’t count on the US wanting to defend Western Europe for ever. It would take only a future – or even the current – US president to announce to the world that he would only ever use its nuclear arsenal to defend the US, never Europe, and we would have no nuclear deterrent at all. Defence is expensive but this is one cost we are going to have to bear.     GETTYMishandling of the event could bolster Trident's opposition The debate over Trident’s replacement was settled last July when 140 Labour MPs defied Jeremy Corbyn and voted with the Government. But there is a danger that the handling of the incident could bolster the unilateral disarmament campaign. There is every reason for the Government to keep back technological details of a misfiring incident – it is important that other military powers should not know where weaknesses may lie.   GETTYIt was however a bad decision for the government to try and deny the incidentBut for the Government to try to deny that such an incident occurred is not clever. Business Secretary Greg Clark tried to explain yesterday that the Government has long had a policy of not commenting on missile tests. But when everyone knows that something went wrong, trying to deny it merely makes it look as if the Government has something terrible to hide.The case for renewing Trident is strong. Theresa May should have no hesitation in continuing to make that case – and to offer the public reassurance that while things will inevitably go wrong from time to time, malfunction will never lead to cataclysm.
