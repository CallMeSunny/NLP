  World War 3: China could be gearing up to wage 'space warfare' the US has warned (Image: GETTY)China made a huge leap forward in space exploration on Thursday by successfully landing an unmanned probe on the Moon’s far side. But numerous experts have warned of the dangers of China’s space exploration programme. They point to the growing chasm between peaceful US scientific programmes devoted to exploration and discovery, and Chinese plans to turn space into what US vice-president, Mike Pence, has described a “war-fighting domain”.

On Thursday China landed a robotic spacecraft called Chang’e 4 on the far side of the Moon in a space exploration world first, touching down at 10.26am local time (2.26am GMT), according to Chinese state media.Of the Moon landing, Professor Hou Xiyun of Nanjing University said: “On the whole, China’s space technology still lags behind the West, but with the landing on the far side of the Moon, we have raced to the front.”In response to the moon landing, and in the face of growing Chinese dominance in outer space, some experts are questioning Beijing’s nefarious intentions.The Pentagon warned earlier this year China’s ambitious space programme was part of Chinese military plans to make space “central to modern warfare”.READ MORE: China lands on ‘dark side of the Moon’ in space WORLD FIRST  Chinese leader Xi Jinping (Image: GETTY)Bob Walker, the space adviser to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, told The Sunday Telegraph: “It's part of a more total Chinese effort.“This is an indication China has the capability to use the moon for military matters.“If you look at what they're doing in the South China Sea.“There are a number of elements to what the People's Liberation Army is doing in terms of aggressive military policy but space is a very big one.”Meanwhile, senior research fellow and China expert at the Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington, Dean Cheng, pointed out how in “In some ways” the US has fallen behind China.READ MORE: WORLD WAR 3: China 'MORE SERIOUS' threat than Putin Related articles   China reaches far side of moon: What is the far side of the moon?

Currently the US is not.”However, other experts have urged perceptive, arguing China’s space programme is, in the short term, about projecting “soft power” as it attempts to expand influence.Adam Ni, China scholar at Australia’s Macquarie University, said: “Space power is about soft power in that it feeds into nationalistic narrative internally and narrative of China's growing power internationally.”READ MORE: FURY as UK gives MILLIONS in aid to China despite Moon landing  China moon landing: one of the first images sent to Earth of the far side of the moon (Image: GETTY)   Wu Weiren, chief scientist of the Chang’e 4 programme, said: “China is making a tremendous effort to become a space power.“This mission will be a landmark event in this endeavour.”The Chinese space probe landing came just months after US President Donald Trump’s Vice President Mike Pence announced plans for a US “Space Force”.The outlandish project seemed far-fetched at the time but China’s growing domination in outer space may give the idea some weight.READ MORE: STAR WARS to become reality? - US Vice President announces SPACE FORCE  Mike Pence announced the Trump administration's plans for a Space Force last year (Image: GETTY)Michael Pillsbury, a veteran China hawk and a key adviser to Trump, told The Sunday Times: “For many years now, western elites have viewed China through rose-tinted spectacles and have overlooked China’s very serious ambitions in space.”However Mike Coffman, a Republican who lost his congressional seat in November’s mid-term elections, still sees the Space Force programme as a pipe-dream.He said: “Space Force, that’s dead in the water.”“It was already questionable, and the Democrats aren’t going to hand this President a victory.”
