    The two leaders have played up their personal relationship, but they are at odds on a number of key issues. China has continually warned against military action by the US on the Korean Peninsula.An American invasion would likely lead to millions of North Korean refugees fleeing over the border and China would be faced with having US forces deployed on its doorstep. But the Asian giant accounts for more than 90 per cent of North Korea’s foreign trade, and White House officials have accused Mr Xi’s government of not making good on its commitments to sanctions. Mr Trump said this week the US trade deficit with China is “embarrassing” and has complained Mr Xi’s policies are “stealing” US manufacturing jobs and stunting economic growth.
