   The energy deal was signed by Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping who was in Manila for a state visit. The pact was one of 29 separate trade deals signed by the pair as Mr Xi became the first Chinese leader to visit the Philippines for 13 years and described the trip as a “milestone” in the countries’ relations. Mr Duterte said there was “a deepening trust and confidence” between the two leaders. He said the pair talked about their increasing trade and investment and China’s involvement in Mr Duterte’s signature $180 billion “Build, Build, Build” infrastructure programme.
