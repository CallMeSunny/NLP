    He said: ”Looking to the future, we are willing to work with the US side to respect each other, deepen mutual trust, focus on practical exchanges and cooperation and appropriately manage and control disputes, to continue injecting positive energy in the development of ties.”China, a strategic rival to the United States and India, is also vital to President Trump's efforts to roll back North Korea's efforts to create nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the United States, an issue expected to top the agenda in his Beijing visit in November.On Monday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Chinese economic pressure could be "key" in negotiating with the hermit nation.He said that economic pressure is the most important diplomatic effort at the moment as they hold North Korea’s economy in their hands; 93 per cent of exports go to China, and Beijing controls the nation’s oil flow.He commended the “willingness” of China to adjust their policies to the real uncertainties form Pyongyang but encouraged them to do more.
