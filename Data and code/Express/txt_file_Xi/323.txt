    It comes after a new spy hotline was set up in China, as well as cartoon posters entitled ‘Dangerous Love’ which sprung up in the country warning citizens to be aware of dating foreigners who could be spies.Guidelines to help people identify spies then appeared on Chinese social media, however it is unclear where the details originated.They were shared widely on Chinese messaging app Wechat, saying potential spies are those with “vague job titles and a lot of money” and “those who bring up controversial topics at parties and then only observe the discussion”.    GETTY China has introduced a law which tightens laws over foreign non-profit organisations The nation’s paranoia over foreign forces has been on the rise since Xi too power.In January, China introduced a law which tightened laws over foreign non-profit organisations.During China’s first National Security Education Day last year, authorities emblazoned walls with posters featuring a comic government employee who falls for a red-haired foreign academic who turns out to be a spy.
