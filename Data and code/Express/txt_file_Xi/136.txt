    In a second Tweet posted 15 minutes later, Mr Trump said: “Melania and I look forward to being with President Xi & Madame Peng Liyuan in China in two weeks for what will hopefully be a historic trip!”As tensions escalate Mr Trump’s attempts to cosy up to China will set alarm bells ringing in Pyongyang, who have relied heavily on Beijing throughout its history. However in recent months, as North Korea continues to recklessly test-fire rockets and nuclear weapons, China has begun to turn against the hermit state.    In February the country cut off imports of North Korean coal - a major money spinner for Kim’s impoverished and starving nation. In response North Korean state media, essentially a mouth piece for Kim, accused China of a “betrayal”. It said: “China should no longer recklessly try to test the limitations of our patience. We have so devotedly helped the Chinese revolution and suffered enormous damage."
