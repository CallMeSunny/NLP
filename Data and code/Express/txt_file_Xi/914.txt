   The rise follows a statement from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.He said: “We respect the British decision to leave our union. But we also ask the British government to understand that someone who leaves the union cannot be in the same privileged position as a member state."After 29 March 2019, the UK will never be an ordinary third country for us. [However, the] UK will always be a very close neighbour and partner."The first part of this statement, and Mr Juncker’s later declaration that the UK will definitively be leaving the EU single market, suggests potential problems for future Brexit negotiations.
