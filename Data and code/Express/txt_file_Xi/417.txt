    Prof Chalmers said: “China has been trying to find another member of the Kim family to replace him – which has of course enraged him.“China are interested more in personnel change rather than regime change.”Beijing’s adoption of a harder line against the rogue state comes after mounting pressure from Donald Trump to act.   Following the secretive states second intercontinental ballistic missile test in July, the US President blasted Beijing for doing “nothing”.Boris Johnson has followed in Trump’s footsteps by backing other foreign ministers in a plan to impose fresh sanctions on North Korea in a bid to dismantle the country’s nuclear programme.The Foreign Secretary detailed the effort that will dismantle vital sources of revenue that is currently being poured into Pyongyang’s weapons programme.  GETTYUS President has previously blasted Beijing for doing “nothing” against North Korea  GETTYChina recently announced that it will cut off a string imports to North KoreaHe said: "North Korea continues to pose an unacceptable threat to the international community, which is why the UK, working closely with our European allies, has secured a set of stringent new sanctions on the regime."As I have said before, the North Korean regime must bear full responsibility for the measures that the international community is enacting against it, including these sanctions."Maximising diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea is the most effective way to pressure Pyongyang to halt its illegal and aggressive actions."
