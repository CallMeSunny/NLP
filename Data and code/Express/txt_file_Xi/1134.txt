    Meanwhile, Kim Jong-un has said it has the capability to attack the US territory of Guam with a nuclear weapon in a direct threat to their arch enemy.Australia has also been the target of threats from the rogue state for its close relationship with the US and South Korea.It is not known what Mr Trump is expected to announce on North Korea once he returns to the White House.   Over the period of the US President’s tour of east and southeast Asia, he has given mixed messages as to his intended next steps to deal with Kim Jong-un.Addressing South Korea’s National Assembly last Wednesday Mr Trump insisted that the US would “not be intimidated” by the dictator’s rhetoric and called for other countries to respond to the “twisted regime’s” threats with a sign of military force.Then, just days later while in China he appeared to seek a diplomatic situation to the North Korea problem, calling on President Xi Jinping to help reign in his out of control neighbour.
