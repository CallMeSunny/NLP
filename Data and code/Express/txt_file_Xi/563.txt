The battle lines continue to harden.”Deborah Elms, Executive Director at the Asian Trade Centre, said US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer can now "turn his total attention to China”.

The rest is a distraction on the way to the real show.“Now he is in a much better position to focus on China all day and night long.“Given the importance of Lighthizer to US trade policy, this is a worrying trend for China."Some experts think the impact of recently-imposed tariffs on Chinese economic activity might make Beijing more willing to agree to a deal but others expect Beijing to retaliate to further US escalation by raising regulatory obstacles to American businesses operating there.

Partly because what Trump and his team want from China is much less clear. Partly because China cares less about what Trump might do."Rachel Ziemba, an emerging market analyst the Centre for New American Security thinktank said Washington's demands on China "still seem more opaque — mixed between market access, end to forced technology transfer, reduction in Chinese exports to US and cuts to overcapacity”.

Not just tariffs, but also denial of access to Western technology."They are probably too late, but it seems to reflect a growing recognition that the dream of China becoming more prosperous and also more democratic/better member of the international community was naïve.“They cannot stop its rise, but maybe they can slow it down."
