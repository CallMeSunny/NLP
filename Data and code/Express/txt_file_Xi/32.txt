  GettyDonald Trump has agreed to meet with North Korea leader Kim Jong-unSteve Tsang, the Director of SOAS China Institute, told Express.co.uk that the meeting between the two leaders was part of an attempt by China to reassert itself on matters concerning North Korea ahead of the proposed meeting between Kim Jong-un, Donald Trump and South Korea leader Moon Jae-in.He explained: “Xi Jinping has just powerfully reminded Trump that he should not be ignored over Korea.“Since President Moon of South Korea started the peace initiative at the Winter Olympics, China appeared to have been completely sidelined.“Korea at their first summit a year ago and Trump has recently raised the heat on trade while China appeared side-lined, it was imperative that Xi should make himself a key player over Korea again.

    Mr Tsang commented: “There would have been a lot of pleasantries but the key subject would have been the proposed Trump-Kim talks, and how they can present the Beijing meeting to the outside world in a mutually beneficial way.“The meeting was most probably the result of a Chinese initiative, as Kim has not a lot to gain from the meeting apart from Xi sharing whatever insights he may have on Trump.“Xi needs the meeting to project China’s leadership and relevance over Korea."The fact that the meeting took place also shows that if Beijing is really determined to exert influence on Pyongyang it can still do so.   “Kim must know that while Xi may look the other way if some UN required sanctions are not enforced fully, no Chinese ships or pipeline will deliver any oil to North Korea if Xi orders all supplies to be stopped for his own reasons.”China confirmed that Xi Jinping had accepted an invitation to visit North Korea after declaring that the hugely rumoured meeting between himself and Kim had actually taken place - however Mr Tsang predicted that the Chinese leader may save the purposed visit until he feels the time is right to reassert his relevance.The expert said: “I doubt that Xi is in a hurry to visit North Korea. He may hold it back until he needs to assert the relevance and significance of China over a solution on the Peninsula again.“This may not imply a long gap either if the Trump-Kim meeting should turn out to be unproductive.”  GettyImages and video emerged yesterday of the meeting between the despot leader and Xi Jinping  GettyBefore the meeting was confirmed the entire event was shrouded in secrecyImages and video emerged yesterday of the meeting between the despot leader and Xi Jinping in Beijing.Mr Kim’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, joined her husband during the visit and was pictured with Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan.Before the meeting was confirmed, the entire event was shrouded in secrecy with only pictures of a train from North Korea prompting speculation that the leader could have made his first foreign visit since taking power in 2011.
