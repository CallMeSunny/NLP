    North Korea threatened to wipe out America last week in 'Korean-style'. A spokesman said: "The Trump administration, which made a surprise guided cruise-missile strike on Syria on April 6, has entered the path of open threat and blackmail."The army and people of the DPRK will as ever courageously counter those who encroach upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK and will always mercilessly ravage all provocative options of the U.S. with Korean-style toughest counteraction." Yesterday it was alleged that North Korea's military weapons cache were made up of dummy props including wood shaped and painted to look like warheads.
