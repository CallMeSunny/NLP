    North Korea have continued to test nuclear weapons over the past few months, with its most recent test being its most powerful. The test took place on September 3 at the Punggye-ri Test Site which registered as a 5.7 magnitude earthquake by the South Korean government. Threats between the rogue state and the US have continued after a senior diplomat from Pyongyang warned the United States to take the threat of a possible atmospheric nuclear test over the Pacific Ocean should be taken “literally”.President Trump is set to travel to Asia in his bid to urge countries to continue applying pressure on the rogue state and its nuclear programmes. The US has deployed nuclear bombers to the Pacific ahead of the Asia tour.
