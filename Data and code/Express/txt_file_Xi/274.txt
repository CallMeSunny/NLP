    Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has pledged that Beijing will crack down on the hermit nation of North Korea.He said: “If we consider traditional economic relations between China and North Korea, it is China that will have to pay most of the price for implementation of the latest resolution.”However, China would sacrifice its own economic interests to ensure peace in the region, he said.Economic sanctions are costing North Korea millions, especially in coal and seafood exports, but the government will not back down.Kim Jong-Un is continuing with his nuclear programme and test firing Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs).
