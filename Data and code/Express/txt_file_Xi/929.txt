   North Korea rarely sends its leaders abroad but, on the rare occasions it does, the Kim dynasty travel in absolute security on a heavily-fortified train.Kim Jong-un was filmed arriving in Beijing this week in a bullet-proof train painted a dark-green colour - the same train which transported his father and grandfather during their bloody reigns.Kim’s father Kim Jong-il even used the train for parties during long-distance trips to Russia or China, scoffing lobster and wine while his citizens starved during the disastrous 1990s famine.The train is packed with bodyguards with each carriage divided into secure units, ensuring total safety for the ‘Dear Leader’ at all times.
