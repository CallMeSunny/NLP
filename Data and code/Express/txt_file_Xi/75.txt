  GETTYTensions have ramped up at the China border after India was accused of entryDiplomats say Beijing would like to resolve the border issue before a summit of the BRICS nations - that also groups Brazil, Russia and South Africa - in the Chinese city of Xiamen in early September, and ensure nothing dampens what China wants to be a show of cooperation and friendship among Third World countries. But that could be tough.

This makes it hard for China or India to back down,” said a Beijing-based source who is familiar with the discussions between the two sides. The Indian government has asked political parties to refrain from politicising the issue and allow diplomacy to work.
