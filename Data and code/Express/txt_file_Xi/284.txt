   After vowing to “handle the situation” in brief comments made shortly after news of the missile launch broke, Trump has promised a raft of “major” sanctions will be imposed on North Korea today.He tweeted: "Just spoke to President Xi Jinping of China concerning the provocative actions of North Korea. Additional major sanctions will be imposed on North Korea today. This situation will be handled!"Details about the sanctions remain unclear but would likely isolate Pyongyang further in a bid to reduce soaring tensions on the Korean peninsula.President Xi said China's priority is to maintain peace in the region.The US President also spoke by phone with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, with all three leaders reaffirming their commitment to combat the North Korean threat.

    “The test-fire was conducted in the highest angle launch system and it had no adverse effect on the security of neighbouring countries.“The great success in the test-fire of ICBM Hawsong-15 is a priceless victory won by the great and heroic people of the DPRK who have upheld the WPK’s line on the simultaneous development of the two fronts with loyalty without the slightest vacillation despite vicious challenges by the US imperialists and their followers and manifold difficulties.”It goes on to say in a “solemn declaration” that the ICBM was to defend the “sovereignty and territorial integrity” of the country from the “US imperialists”.It added: “As a responsible nuclear power and a peace-loving state, the DPRK will make every possible effort to serve the noble purpose of defending peace and stability of the world.”
