  GettyUS network providers are already in the process of testing the much-improved networksThe official revealed that the idea of a government network is being discussed at a low level but could be considered by the Republican firebrand himself in as little as six months time.The official declared: "We want to build a network so the Chinese can't listen to your calls."We have to have a secure network that doesn't allow bad actors to get in. We also have to ensure the Chinese don't take over the market and put every non-5G network out of business."A decision to create a high-tech 5G network to restrict China’s US access would line up with Mr Trump’s hard-line approach to Beijing that has seen him press Xi Jinping to get results on matters surrounding North Korea.

    An official explained that the US could work with the “industry” to put its security idea into fruition.They said: "We want to build a secure 5G network and we have to work with industry to figure out the best way to do it.”The comments from officials appeared to add weight to an earlier report that stated the US government could rent access to the 5G network to providers such as AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile.
