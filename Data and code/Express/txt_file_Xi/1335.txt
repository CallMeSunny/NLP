   Donald Trump hit China with a whopping $50billion (£44.8billion) of duties on Chinese goods this summer and may unleash a further $200billion (£179billion) worth of crippling levies in the weeks to come.China hit back at the US, plying $50billion on US goods and threatening to impose another $60billion if tensions between the two nations do not subside.But because of China's massive trade surplus of US goods, experts believe Beijing’s retaliatory measures cannot compete with Mr Trump’s damaging tariffs, with the US relying heavily on Chinese imported goods.This is because the Chinese population doesn’t buy enough goods from US manufacturers in which to slap on equal amounts of tariffs and could affect the country’s own growth in the process.
