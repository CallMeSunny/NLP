   The Su-35 Russian-made advanced fighters were sent to the waterway for joint combat cruise missions, according to the official account of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force. The PLA Air Force tweeted: "This is a pragmatic action for the air force to fulfil its mission in the new era and conduct a combat training military exercise.”Xu Guangyu, a retired major general, told China’s state-owned Global Times the move was a “reaction to the provocation by the US” after Washington sent destroyers to the South China Sea last month.If the Chinese jets land on a South China Sea island, it could act as a major deterrent to rival forces with claims to the disputed waterway, he added.

    US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has previously likened Beijing’s activities in the South China Sea to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and recent developments in the region are unlikely to be welcomed by Washington.Speaking at his confirmation hearing in January 2017, Mr Tillerson said: "Building islands and then putting military assets on those islands is akin to Russia's taking of Crimea. Its taking of territory that others lay claim to."We're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops, and second, your access to those islands also not going to be allowed."
