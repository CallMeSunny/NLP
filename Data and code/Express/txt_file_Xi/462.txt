   Surveillance photographs appear to show China’s growing efforts to militarise the disputed waterway with new images revealing construction works during the latter half of 2017.The sea carries huge strategic importance, with one-third of the world's shipping passing through, carrying over $3trillion in trade each year.Oil and gas reserves are located under the seabed and the body of water also holds lucrative fishing opportunities.China, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan have overlapping claims to the South China Sea, while Donald Trump repeatedly attacked Beijing during his presidential campaign for trying to snatch control of the waters.

And what changed is the United States stopped paying attention.” The Philippine Daily Inquirer, which obtained the images, claims the pictures show an  “unrestrained” building campaign designed to extend China’s influence over the waters.Some of the images appear to show runways, hangars, control towers and helipads while others appear to reveal cargo ships and supply vessels nearby.  INQUIRER.NET  INQUIRER.NETEugenio Bito-onon Jr., the former mayor of Kalayaan town on Pag-asa Island, the largest Philippine-occupied island, told the newspaper the photos are authentic after claiming to see the contraction for himself when he flew over the region almost two years previously.He said: “These photos are authentic. I flew with HBO before the elections in 2016. We got repeated warnings from the Chinese because we were circling over the islands. I see there are now additional vertical features.”Washington has not yet reacted to the pictures but previous comments from high-ranking officials suggest the news will not be well received. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said during his confirmation hearing in January 2017: "Building islands and then putting military assets on those islands is akin to Russia's taking of Crimea. Its taking of territory that others lay claim to.  INQUIRER.NET  INQUIRER.NET"We're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops, and second, your access to those islands also not going to be allowed."Last month, Australia became embroiled with Beijing over the waterway and a Chinese state newspaper has belittled its rival as an insignificant world power because of Canberra's "meddling" in the South China Sea row.The Global Times accused Australia of adopting a diplomatic role too closely aligned with the US.It read: "Provocations in the South China Sea may prompt China to adopt strong countermeasures which will seriously impact Australian economic development.  INQUIRER.NET  GETTYChina's regional neighbours have repeatedly contested Beijing's claims to the waterway"Excessive involvement in the South China Sea has increased Canberra's strategic burden, widened the gap between its limited prowess and its goal to become a middle power. “Australia has held this goal for a long time and wants to have its position in international affairs."However, due to its small population and limited strength, Canberra hasn't stood out in global geopolitics."
