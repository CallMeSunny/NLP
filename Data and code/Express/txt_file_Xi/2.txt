  GETTYChinese President Xi Jinping and Theresa May meet in BeijingAnd one political commentator said in theory, Xi could stay on even longer than recently deposed Robert Mugabe who held onto power for 37 years as prime minister and later president of Zimbabwe.Since taking office more than five years ago, Xi has overseen a radical shake-up of China's Communist Party, including getting rid of top leaders once thought untouchable as part of a war on deep-rooted corruption.The announcement, carried by state news agency Xinhua, said the proposal had been made by the party's Central Committee, the largest of its elite ruling bodies and also covers the vice president position.Xi, 64, is currently required by China's constitution to step down as president after two five-year terms. Nearing the end of his first presidential term, he will be formally elected to a second at the annual meeting of China's largely rubber-stamp parliament opening on March 5.

Though positive remarks filled the comments section under the pages of main state media outlets such as the People's Daily, there was less support on China's social media Weibo service.One user said: "If two terms are not enough, then they can write in a third term, but there needs to be a limit. Getting rid of it is not good!" Constitutional reform needs to be approved by parliament, which is stacked with members chosen for their loyalty to the party - meaning the reform will not be blocked.There has been persistent speculation that Xi wants to stay on in office past the customary two five-year terms. The October party congress ended without appointing a clear eventual successor for Xi.

    However, the role of party chief is more senior than that of president. At some point, Xi could be given a party position which also enables him to stay on as long as he likes.Xi is currently the party's general secretary, but not chairman. China's first three leaders after the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 all carried the title party chairman – Mao Zedong, Hua Guofeng and then Hu Yaobang. It has not been used since.However, Zhang Ming, a professor of political science at Renmin University of China in Beijing, explained: “Whether Xi ends up being Party Chairman or just remains Party Secretary doesn't really matter. What matters is whether he holds onto power."Titles don't matter as much in China as they do in the West. Here what matters is whether you are the emperor. In China, ordinary people already consider Xi Jinping to be the emperor."
