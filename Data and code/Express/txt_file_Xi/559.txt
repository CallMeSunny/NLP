   With World War 3’s looming threat continues to terrify the Korean peninsula, neighbouring China has become increasingly exasperated with North Korea.Nicholas Burns, former US Ambassador to Greece, said the persistent North Korean threat is helping President Donald Trump push for more action against Kim Jong-un.Mr Burns said: “The Chinese are clearly frustrated with the North Koreans. Chinese don’t want a war in the Korean peninsula: they want trade.“The Chinese have done more under President Trump than any other American president. They signed up to the UN sanctions, there are now individual Chinese sanctions.  CNBC/GETTYMr Burns said China is becoming frustrated with North Korea and will help Trump defuse the tensios“The Central bank governor instructed banks wind up loans to North Korea.”The Harvard Kennedy School professor suggested President Trump use this newfound willingness to act upon the missile threats as a way to “turn the heat up” on North Korea.Speaking to CNBC, Mr Burns continued: “Xi Jinping has just been given this new mandate to govern. He’s now probably on a par with Mao Tse Tung.“Job number one for President Trump is to focus the Chinese on expanding those sanctions and turning up the heat on North Korea.”   China has come under increased pressure from the US to exercise its influence to try and defuse the tension between Washington and Pyongyang. North Korea will now face stronger calls to put an end to its nuclear development programme after the Punggye-ri facility suffered a devastating collapse, leaving an estimated 200 people dead.Experts warned the accidents could provoke a dangerous cloud of radioactive fallout escaping from the side and spreading across “an entire hemisphere.”Punggye-ri was the site of the DPRK’s sixth nuclear test on September 3, when a huge 100-kiloton explosive was tested.Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences warned Pyongyang of possible risks to the facility shortly after the test took place.
