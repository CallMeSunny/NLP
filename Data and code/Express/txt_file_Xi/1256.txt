   Britain was the first country to come forward in support of last night's Tomahawk strikes on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's Shayrat airbase in Homs after it was revealed the fatal chemical attack in Idlib on Tuesday, which killed at least 80, was launched from there.Australia was next to follow, while Turkey, Japan, Israel, Italy, Germany and Saudi Arabia all expressing their praise for Mr Trump's decision shortly after.Donald Tusk, the European Parliament President, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Parliament President, have also supported the strikes.  GETTY•REUTERS•EXPRESSOpinions are split over who is supporting Trump's strikes or supporting Assad Related articles   Hillary Clinton urged US airstrike hours before trump's missile attack   SAS mission to destroy Assad chemical arsenal 'ABORTED at last minute' However, Russia and Iran were quick to condemn the move, while China has remained fairly neutral as President Xi Jinping meets with President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida today.The move was always going to be controversial, with Mr Trump rolling back six years of restraint by the US under Barack Obama, just two days after the chemical weapons attack.  Express.co.ukCountries are divided over who they supportDespite Theresa May being relatively outspoken against Mr Trump during his election campaign, the UK was keen to show it believes the strikes were the correct reaction.A Government spokesman, said: "The UK Government fully supports the US action which we believe was an appropriate response to the barbaric chemical weapons attack launched by the Syrian regime and is intended to deter further attacks."Fellow European countries have come out in favour of the airstrikes, however some of their right-wing opponents have said they have lost their faith in Mr Trump.France, Italy and Germany have cautiously supported the strikes, with French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault saying he does not want an escalation of the Syrian conflict and Russia should now join talks.He said: "We do not want an escalation. We have to stop the hypocrisy. If Russia is acting in good faith it should stop and negotiate."We do not wish to raise the stakes, but to find a solution. You can not deal with reality (use of chemical weapons) by resorting to propaganda."Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said Italy, France and Germany believe there must be a negotiated solution to the Syrian conflict.

    Russia and Iran were immediately outspoken in their condemnation of the strikes against their ally.A spokesman for Vladimir Putin said the strike had seriously damaged ties between Washington and Moscow as he threatened to increase Russian military force in Syria in association with ally President Assad.Mr Putin regarded the US action as "aggression against a sovereign nation" on a "made-up pretext", spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.   Iran, Syria's closest regional ally, also denounced the strikes, calling them a "violation of international laws".Bahrain Qasemi, an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, said: "Iran condemns the use of chemical weapons, but at the same time believes it is dangerous, destructive and a violation of international laws to use it as an excuse to take unilateral actions."Iran strongly condemns any such unilateral strikes."Such measures will strengthen terrorists in Syria and will complicate the situation in Syria and the region."  GettyItalian PM Paolo Gentiloni said Italy, France and Germany do not want an escalation  GettyThe Shayrat airfield in Syria was hit by 59 US missilesEuropean right-wing politicians have also condemned the attacks, saying they are disappointed in Mr Trump's decision.French presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen has said she is "surprised" about Mr Trump's reaction to the chemical attack.She said: "Let us wait for the results of an international investigation before carrying out strikes in Syria."I am surprised about this reaction."What has happened in Syria is terrible and I strongly condemn it. But first, we must have an international investigation."We must allow democracy and the people of Syria to express themselves. It is up to them to choose their own leader."

Where will it end?"His successor, Paul Nuttall, was even stronger in his condemnation.The Ukip leader, said: "The US bombing of Syria last night was rash, trigger happy, nonsensical and will achieve nothing. I hoped for better."Matteo Salvini, the leader of the right-wing Italian party Lega Nord, was equally outspoken, as he said the strikes are a "gift to ISIS".He said: "Perhaps because of the internal problems in the USA, perhaps badly advised by warmongers who are still looking for Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons, Trump has made the wrong choice in Syria and reopens a war against Islamic terrorism that had already been won."Maybe someone in Washington wants to repeat the disaster of Iraq, Libya and the Arab spring with all the devastating consequences for Italy and Europe?"
