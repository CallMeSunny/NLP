   North Korea will not negotiate with Donald Trump if the US relies on China to cooperate as its only strategy against the rogue state. Kim Jong-un sparked further fears of World War 3 after telling the world he was ready to launch a nuclear strike on the United States at any time, during his New Year's address from Pyongyang.Aaron Connelly of the Lowy Institute for International Policy told CNBC News that China’s help against Kim Jong-un is becoming more unlikely as Xi Jinping fails to comply with UN sanctions. The Research Fellow in the East Asia Programme of the Lowy Insitute said: “For years the US administrations have assumed that if they can just get China to play ball on North Korea to cut off oil imports or coal exports then North Korea will come to heal and they would have a more pliable negotiating partner in North Korea.  GETTYNorth Korea news: China will not help Donald Trump stop Kim Jong-un China ultimately won’t cut off all economic aid or trade with North KoreaAaron Connelly“But it’s become clear to administration after administration, to the Bush administration and the Obama administration, and I think to the Trump administration, that China will go so far in terms of pressuring North Korea and the relationship between North Korea and Beijing was not good.“But they ultimately won’t cut off all economic aid or trade with North Korea.“If that’s the only element of US administration’s strategy in getting North Korea to come to the negotiating table and play ball in terms of nuclear negotiations, it’s not going to work. That’s becoming increasingly clear to people in the Trump administration in Washington.”Chinese ships were spotted by US satellite images illegally selling oil to North Korea. At the news, Donald Trump tweeted: "Caught RED HANDED - very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen!"   In his televised New Year’s speech, Kim Jong-un threatened the US saying he is ready to defend his country if he feels it is necessary. He said: “The entire United States is within range of our nuclear weapons and a nuclear button is always on my desk.“This is a reality, not a threat.” US and South Korea meet for winter drill on North Korea's doorstep Wed, December 20, 2017The winter training exercise originally was designed to prepare for possible North Korea attacks and is annually held by soldiers of South Korea's and the U.S. Marine Corps Play slideshow  AFP/Getty Images1 of 12A South Korean Marine aims his rifle on a snowy hill during a joint winter drill with US Marines in Pyeongchang
