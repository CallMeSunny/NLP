   In a rare instance of Pyongyang using state media to threaten Beijing, the North Korean government issued the threat through commentary written by a person named Jong Phil, published by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).Referring to its trade partner and only ally as a “country around the DPRK”, the commentary accused China of failing to criticise actions taken by Donald Trump’s administration, while continuing to take punitive measures against Pyongyang.

    Experts have argued the commentary appears to be Pyongyang’s response to the calls of Chinese experts and media for escalated tensions against North Korea.A US F18 fighter jet involved in a show of force against Kim Jong-un’s despotic state crashed into the Japan Sea yesterday.The sole pilot survived by ejecting and landing in the sea, before being rescued by a helicopter crew.
