  GETTY Donald Trump is under pressure to break down Kim Jong-un with the help of ChinaThe relationship between the US and Kim Jong-un’s neighbour is a complicated one, but the trip has been hailed as the moment President Trump will call on his Asian allies to confront the warmongering state. In recent months President Donald Trump has been highly critical of Beijing over its aggressive behaviour, but at the same time places pressure on China to do more to rein in its neighbour.But President Xi Jinping is deeply suspicious of any US backed military build up in the region and has repeatedly expressed anger at the deployment of a US anti-missile defence system in South Korea.However, when President Trump sets out on his five-nation Asian tour on Friday to reassert American leadership in the region, all eyes will be on how he handles China over North Korea.   GETTY Donald Trump well set out on his Asia tour on Friday  Related articles   The REAL special relationship: Prince Harry and Barack Obama    YOU LOST!’ Boris Johnson in hilarious slap down to SNP Remainer   We should all hope that the President begins to act like a leader during his time in Asia.

Xi knows that flattering Trump throws him off guard, so he will probably roll out the red carpet.”The American expert said it is vital President Trump stamps his authority or face looking “more naive”. She said: “The United States will suffer another blow to our global standing if Trump fails to talk to Xi, and to share a real readout of those discussions publicly, about tough issues like trade, intellectual property theft and cybersecurity while in Beijing.  North Korea stages anti-US rally in battle with Donald Trump Mon, September 25, 2017Tens of thousands of Pyongyang residents were gathered in the capital's Kim Il-Sung Square to laud leader Kim Jong-Un's denunciation of US President Donald Trump.

    “Playing a round of golf with Xi may be a good photo op, but if he doesn't focus on business he'll come out of his time in China looking more naive.” Ms Winograd also warned of the Russian threat because US officials have decided to skip the the East Asia Summit (EAS). She added: “This will leave more room for the leaders of Russia and China to dominate the discussion at the summit.“It's a major downside risk to our national security to let China and Russia steer security discussions because our interests are not aligned.”  GETTY Trump is expected to put pressure on President Xi Jinping to stem the threat of North Korea China has repeatedly rapped despot Kim on the knuckles as the international community places more responsibility on Beijing to solve the crisis, which could erupt into World War 3. Ms Winograd said America’s “safety depends” on President Trmp and him acting like a leader. Describing the Asia tour as the “first step toward repositioning the United States for global leadership after a tough few months,” she said: “Failing to act like a leader while overseas, however, could instead push the US further into the background as new leaders rise in power.“National security shouldn't be a partisan issue, and we should all hope that the President begins to act like a leader during his time in Asia. Our safety depends on it.” It comes after it emerged President Trump will stay away from the border between South and North Korea during his tour.
