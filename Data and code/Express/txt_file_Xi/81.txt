    Underscoring the mystery, one senior Beijing-based diplomatic source told Reuters simply: "We just don't know."For his part, Mr Mattis said it "kinda looked like" Kim went to Beijing, but told reporters at the Pentagon, "I don't know."Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, met then-president Jiang Zemin in China in 2000 before a summit between the two Koreas in June that year.Kim Jong Il was considered at the time to have made the visit to reaffirm close ties with China.   Yoo Ho-yeol, Professor of North Korean studies at Seoul's Korea University, said: "North Korea likely wants to confirm its relationship with China and believes it has some leverage with which it can ask for things from China.”If North Korea speaks with the United States on its own, it might feel it is at a disadvantage but, if it has China as an ally, Pyongyang may think it will be able to protect its interests and profits during the summits."The roly poly North Korean leader, who is believed to be in his mid-thirties, has stuck to his own country since taking over following his father’s death in 2017. If true, his visit to China would be his first trip outside his own country since he took power seven years ago.During this time he has attended plenty of military parades – although he is also reported to be a huge Manchester United fan, as well as enjoying day-time soap operas.
