  GETTYOn the balcony of Buckingham PalaceThe Royal Wedding only feels like yesterday and yet, five years on, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s lives could not be more transformed.Back when they exchanged vows before a global audience of more than two billion at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011, William and Kate barely had a care in the world.As they sealed their love with a kiss on the Buckingham Palace balcony and drove off as newlyweds in Prince Charles’s Aston Martin DB6 MKII, their marriage signalled the dawn of an exciting new era for the House of Windsor.Now parents to Prince George, two, and 11-month-old Princess Charlotte, as they toast their fifth anniversary on Friday, there is no doubt the Cambridges have breathed new life into the sometimes stuffy institution of the monarchy. The Royal Wedding only feels like yesterday and yet, five years on, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s lives could not be more transformedAs their recent colourful tour of India and Bhutan showed, the forward-thinking couple are global ambassadors for Great Britain. The trip came after equally well-received official visits to Canada and the US in 2011, Malaysia, Singapore, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu in 2012 and New Zealand and Australia in 2014, when they took the then eight-month-old George. As William has become more statesmanlike on Royal engagements, Kate has also grown in confidence. No longer just a Royal plus-one, the Duchess has carved out a charitable role for herself while finding her feet as a mother.Today’s Kate appears decidedly more self-assured than the shy, nervous 20-something who was interviewed by news anchor Tom Bradby following the Royal engagement in November 2010. “I’m willing to learn quickly,” she insisted, somewhat apprehensively. “I really hope I can make a difference, even in the smallest way.”William, forever her most stalwart supporter, added, reassuringly: “She’ll do really well.”So how have they both fared over five years? Veteran Royal commentator Ingrid Seward says it’s to Kate’s credit that she’s singled out a cause close to her heart so early in her Royal career.

For Princess Anne it was Save the Children and that was the making of her. In five years Kate has found something, which is quite quick for a Royal. This job is for the rest of her life, let’s not forget.”In January 2012, Kensington Palace announced that Kate, 34, would be becoming patron of four organisations – Action on Addiction, East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices, the Art Room and the National Portrait Gallery – as well as being a volunteer for the Scout Association.The following April, another three Royal patronages were announced, of Place2Be, SportsAid and the Natural History Museum. In 2014, the Duchess became patron of the 1851 Trust, which promotes sailing – one of her favourite pastimes.Kate recognised that mental health was a common thread running through her charity work and has now pledged to raise awareness of the issue, especially where children are concerned.In February, she recorded a video messagefor Place2Be, which provides emotional and therapeutic support for vulnerable children, calling for schools to provide more emotional support. Kate & William's fourth wedding anniversary Wed, April 29, 2015It's four years since Prince William and Kate Middleton tied the knot to become the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. To celebrate, we're taking a look back at their relationship so far in pictures.

    Advocating early intervention, the Duchess said: “Every child deserves to grow up feeling confident that they won’t fall at the first hurdle, that they can cope with life’s setbacks. While we cannot always change a child’s circumstances, we can give them the tools to cope, and to thrive.”Kate also appears to have mostly conquered her fear of public speaking, having previously admitted it terrified her. She managed to brush her anxieties aside to address a headteachers’ conference last November, discussing how some children do not have the “wonderful and secure childhood” she was lucky enough to experience and how that can affect their mental health in later life.Aides have said this is just the beginning, and that the Duchess will become even more vocal about the issues that are most important to her as she grows into her Royal role. Marriage and motherhood have helped Kate evolve from an inexperienced princess who was seen and not heard into a sophisticated future queen who is keen to be listened to. As the mother of a future king and Charlotte (the so-called “spare to the heir”), the Duchess’s role in the Royal Family is now more influential than ever. While campaigning alongside his wife to end the stigma surrounding mental illness, William, 33, has also spent the last five years championing the causes closest to his heart – young people, the military and conservation. Since 2011, the Cambridges’ charitable efforts have been channelled through the Royal Foundation they share with Prince Harry – a vehicle for their charity work that has raised more than £16 million.As patron of the Tusk Trust and president of United for Wildlife, the illegal ivory trade and poaching have been a main focus for William, who visited an elephant sanctuary during his tour of the Far East last year to highlight the plight of elephants killed for their tusks in China.After raising the subject with Chinese President Xi Jinping, he called on the country’s residents to give up the fashion for ivory, which is fuelling poaching in Africa.  GETTYEnjoying a family skiing holiday this year at Courchevel in the French AlpsEnjoying a family skiing holiday this year at Courchevel in the French AlpsIn Tuvalu, during their tour of the Far East in 2012“Ultimately, ending demand for ivory is down to citizens across the world,” he said. “No tradition or fashion is worth the extinction of an entire species, and no criminal gang should be allowed to destroy any part of nature.”Earlier this year, William courted controversy during an interview with ITV News anchor Mark Austin when he insisted that so-called “trophy hunting” was justified in certain circumstances. “So when one is infertile, he’s at the end of his life, if somebody out there wants to pay that money – and it wouldn’t be me – but if somebody did, then as long as that money goes back into protection of the species, it’s a justifiable means of conserving species that are under serious threat,” he said.The comments came amid growing criticism of the Cambridges’ lifestyle. Much has been made of the fact that, despite having spent £4 million of taxpayers’ money renovating apartment 1A at Kensington Palace, the couple choose to live at Anmer Hall, their country bolthole on the Queen’s Sandringham estate (which has also undergone extensive refurbishment, but at the Royal Family’s own expense). Aides have made no secret of the fact that William and Kate find living in London “like a goldfish bowl” and are happier away from the limelight on their 20,000-acre Norfolk estate, where they are afforded total privacy – plus exclusive use of the swimming pool and tennis court. In December last year, Kensington Palace announced that George would be attending a local nursery, Westacre Montessori School, in the nearby village of East Walton. It was recently reported that the family will relocate to London so George can start school in September 2017 at Wetherby Prep, where William and Harry were both educated, but this has not yet been officially confirmed. Although they have a Spanish nanny, Maria Borrallo, and an Italian housekeeper, Antonella Fresolone, as well as a Fijian orderly in their small entourage, the couple strive to be as hands-on as possible, and Kate drives George to nursery herself several mornings a week.William’s prioritisation of parenthood has not been without its detractors. The Duke left the RAF in 2013, after working as a search and rescue pilot based at RAF Valley on Anglesey, where the couple used to rent a modest farmhouse for £750 a month. Their idyllic existence on the tiny island, where they would regularly walk along the beach with their black spaniel Lupo, then a puppy, was as “normal” as life got for a pair of high-profile Royals.   Kate would tend to the small cottage garden while William was flying Sea King helicopters, popping to the local supermarket to pick up groceries and indulging her love of cooking (she gave the Queen a jar of home-made chutney for their first Christmas together). On returning to Anglesey in February, Kate said, “It was such a special time for us. It was the start of our life together really.” Admitting they would “miss it terribly” before they left, it’s no wonder the couple have tried to recreate the magic at Anmer, where clever new landscaping ensures maximum privacy.Now a pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance, working 80 hours a month, William still carries out sporadic Royal engagements, but some have questioned whether the second in line to the throne should be doing more to support his grandparents, the Queen having recently turned 90 and Prince Philip due to celebrate his 95th birthday on June 10.The monarch still carries out more Royal engagements in a year than William, Kate and Harry combined. Despite being almost three times their age, last year Her Majesty performed 306 official duties in the UK and 35 abroad, while the young trio managed only 198 and 94 between them.A part-time prince William may be, but the Queen has been nothing but supportive. An interesting development over the past five years has been Her Majesty’s unprecedented efforts to integrate the Middletons into the Royal Family fold. As well as inviting Kate’s parents Michael and Carole to key annual events like Royal Ascot, she even let William and Kate spend their Christmas lunch with the “in-laws” in 2014, and invited the entire Middleton family to stay at Sandringham for four days in January this year. The extended shooting party, to which Kate’s siblings Pippa and James were also invited, signalled not only the respect Her Majesty has for the self-made Middletons but also her love for her grandson and heir.The two have been close ever since his school days at Eton, when William would join “Granny” for tea at Windsor Castle on Sunday afternoons. He recently told an ITV documentary to mark her 90th birthday: “Growing up, having this figurehead, having this stability above me has been incredible. I’ve been able to explore and slightly carve my own path. I greatly appreciate and value that protection.”William has always insisted that family is a “non-negotiable” – not just when it comes to his own children but Kate’s close-knit clan, too.

    In return, the Queen has grown to admire the unshowy way the couple go about their family life – the reason she has given her blessing for them to enjoy such a remarkably independent existence away from the capital and much of the relentless Royal routine.The Cambridges’ set-up is said to remind her of her own upbringing, before her father became King, when she and her sister Princess Margaret enjoyed an idyllic childhood out of the spotlight. When her Uncle David (Edward VIII) abdicated in 1936, the family her father once described as “us four” had to move from their London townhouse into the austere surroundings of Buckingham Palace. Then, her father’s sudden death at the age of 56 in 1952 thrust her on to the throne at the age of 25 and with two small children. She had hoped she and Prince Philip would be able to bring up their family relatively undisturbed until she was at least 40, but instead the Queen missed much of Charles and Anne growing up because of official visits abroad. Interestingly, Ingrid Seward believes that Prince Charles also supports his son for the very same reason. “This is what Charles wants William to do. He has said to his son, ‘Don’t make the same mistake that I made and miss your children growing up. Take it easy.’”Like Charles, William has had his destiny mapped out from the day he was born. Just as the heir to the throne doesn’t want his son to repeat his own mistakes, he also doesn’t want his beloved grandchildren to have absent parents like he did.So as they embark on their sixth year of marriage, the Cambridges are enjoying the best of both worlds. With the Queen’s blessing, William has been able to delay taking on his full share of Royal duties, and thanks to his shift patterns with the air ambulance he can also devote time to his family and charitable ambitions.So it wouldn’t be surprising if we heard the pitter-patter of tiny Royal feet once more. Despite having suffered with very severe morning sickness during her first two pregnancies, as one of three, Kate is said to be keen to have another child.Although William often jokes about George being a “terror” (“Please tell me it gets easier,” he begged fellow parents at an event he attended in February), parenthood has been the making of the prince.In January, the Duke admitted to Ant and Dec in an interview to mark 40 years of the Prince’s Trust that he is a lot more emotional than he used to be. Speaking of his mother Princess Diana’s death in a Paris car crash in 1997, when he was 15, he added: “You realise how precious life is and it puts it all into perspective. The idea of not being around to see your children grow up and stuff like that.“I remember my mother and father taking us to various charities and organisations. Seeing such a broad spectrum of life is really important from a young age to give you a bit of perspective. You don’t just live in a palace, it’s very important you see what goes on in the ordinary world.”Very much his mother’s son, it seems that William is determined to continue not only Diana’s charitable legacy, but also her modern approach to the monarchy and breaking the Royal mould.
