   The anti-ship missile, Hsuing Feng-3, can be seen being launched from a corvette. The projectile has a range of anywhere from 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) to 400 kilometers (248.5 miles), Asia Times notes, adding that the weapon is the latest variant of a missile family whose lineage in Taiwan traces back to the 1970s.
