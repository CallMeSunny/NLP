    City skipper Vincent Kompany said he was sad about the cancellation and apologised to fans, before adding: “I do feel it’s not the last time we will come to Beijing. If we’re patient, like Chinese people are, then good things will come around again and we’ll be here again.”In a video message to the fans, United midfielder Juan Mata said: “I know you are all disappointed but I wanted to say thank you for all your amazing support here in China. In Shanghai and now in Beijing, we really felt that you love the club, love United. So we are really disappointed because we were looking forward to the game. But I’m sure we will be back really soon.”Defender Luke Shaw added: “Obviously I know you’re all disappointed and as players we’re all disappointed too. We came out here to play here in front of all you fans because we know how much you love us all. We’re so sorry and if we could change it, we all want to play right now but that is the final decision and we can’t play. Hopefully we’ll see you all soon.’Patrick Murphy, spokesman for the ICC tournament, said: “The extreme weather leading up to the match in Beijing has damaged the National Stadium playing surface to an extent that leaves it in an unplayable condition.  GETTYEd Woodward confirmed that Jose Mourinho's Man United will return to China in the future“We have collectively made this cancellation decision in the interest of player safety and concerns over the players’ subsequent ability to put on a display for the fans that meets the quality standard of the International Champions Cup.“The conditions experienced in Beijing on July 19 and July 20 were reported as being some of the most extreme weather conditions the capital of China has experienced in recent history. Regular rain occurred also on July 21 and July 22.“The decision was made collectively by tournament organisers, participating clubs, the China Football Association, the Beijing Football Association and the management of the National Stadium.”United flew home last night to prepare for their next friendly against Turkish club Galatasaray in Gothenburg on Saturday where new signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic is expected to make his debut.City have remained in China and fly to Shenzen in the south of the country for Thursday’s game against Borussia Dortmund which, the organisers say, is not in any danger.
