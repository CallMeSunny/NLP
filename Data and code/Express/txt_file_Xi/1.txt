The new law abolishes term limits in China and makes Xi the country’s most powerful ruler since Mao Zedong, who led China from 1949-76.The National People’s Congress passed Xi’s amendment to abolish term limits by an astonishing 2,956-vote margin.President Xi Jinping - known as ‘Xi Dada (Big Uncle Xi)’ in Communist propaganda - cast the first ballot at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing himself to rapturous applause.2,958 delegates later voted to abolish term limits and only two opposed, with three abstentions and one invalid vote.

GETTYPresident Xi watching his amendment get passed“He used the constitution as the ultimate legal weapon that binds all officials and all citizens.”Under the old rule, Xi would have had to give up the office in 2023.Instead he can now take power indefinitely.Ju Xiuquin, a delegate from northeastern Heilongjiang province, said: “This is the urgent wish of the common people.”   The parliament also added Xi’s philosophical treatise, ‘Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,’ to its constitution at the meeting.Only Mao and Deng have had their names alongside their guidelines in the constitution - but since taking office in 2012, Xi has worked to consolidate his rule.He wants to make a ‘world class military’ and to turn the country into a global economic powerhouse before 2050.Xi has clamped down on civil freedoms - detaining activists and lawyers, as well as censoring the internet - in pursuit of his goals.

    The Chinese President has also tackled corruption, punishing more than one million party officials and sidelining potential rivals.Chinese political commentator Wu Qiang said: “I think that during the past five years, he has been carrying out a soft coup, including making the Politburo a mere figurehead.“He wants to prevent power from falling into the hands of technocrats like Jiang (Zemin) and Hu (Jintao).”The Communist Party claims the rule responds to ‘the masses’ desire for the removal of term limits.   But while Xi discussed the amendment with his Politburo in September, it was kept secret until a state media report just one week before its proposing.Dos Yanli, a delegate from astern Shandong, said: “Xi Jinping has presided over so many important projects such as economic reforms and the fight against corruption.“There was a consensus that we supported him having more time to finish his work.”
