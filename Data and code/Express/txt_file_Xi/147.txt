   The move comes as China looks to expand its military with the aim of having the best army in the world by 2030.The Long March 2D booster was sent into space from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi desert.According to the dictatorship, the satellite is designed for remote-sensing of land resources, and the technology will analyse vegetation, water, impervious surfaces, nutrients, and soil.

    The spy satellites will allow the Chinese government to track stealthy targets such as US B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, which usually cannot be seen, within 10 years.Using a system called ghost imaging China will be able to take pictures of the military air force, even if they are flying below heavy cloud.The communist state is currently hoping to invest enough money to have a prototype satellite complete by 2020, test the new technology by 2025 and then implement the big Brother styled satellites by 2030.   The announcement comes after Eric Schmidt, the head of Google’s parent company Alphabet, made a stark warning earlier this month about Beijing’s plans to invest heavily in technology.Speaking about whether the US or China would have more technological power Mr Schmidt said: “It's pretty simple.
