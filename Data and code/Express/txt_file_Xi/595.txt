   VTB, a major state-run Russian bank, has announced plans to double its headcount in Shanghai over the next three to four years.Riccardo Orcel, head of international operations at what is Russia’s second largest bank, will aim to appeal to Chinese companies keen to expand into his country.Key services set for expansion in China will include commercial banking, foreign exchange, and trade finance.Referring to the bank’s Shanghai office which employed about 35 people, he reportedly said: “We are looking for new premises because we are totally full.”  China president Xi Jinping (Image: GETTY) Related articles   TRUMP WARNING: Germany could cosy up with RUSSIA AND CHINA against US   300,000 Russian and Chinese troops j China celebrate Vostok 2018 He referred to the “extremely good relationship” between Russia and China and the “not so good relationships that exists moving towards the west” as a major motivation for expanding eastward.VTB, led by president Andrei Kostin, has already scaled down its operations in Europe and effectively cut ties with the US.It is Russia’s only lender with a full brand in China.China has reportedly invested around $7 billion in Russia through acquisitions and mergers since 2013.

Hopefully, this will be resolved, in the end, by myself and President Xi Jinping of China, for whom I have great respect and affection.”
