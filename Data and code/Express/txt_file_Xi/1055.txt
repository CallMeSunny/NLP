   Italy is said to be on the verge of becoming the first G7 country to endorse Beijing’s “Belt and Road” investment programme. The Asian Infrastructure Investment bank’s plan to put money into global transport, logistics and infrastructure projects has been largely resisted by Brussels and Washington. Rome’s coalition government made up of League and the Five Star Movement will attempt to allay international fears that the Belt and Road project poses a security threat.
