But the UK has traditionally been an open country, welcoming of foreign direct investment. And we'll continue to do that.”He did not comment on the US deal rejection.The Government is keen to sign a free trade pact with China once it leaves the EU, and London and Beijing have been keen to show that Britain's withdrawal from the bloc will not affect ties.Fox said China's service sector openness was a "big issue" for Britain, but that there were more options than a post-Brexit free trade agreement (FTA) to get Beijing to open, including specific service sector agreements and mutual recognition deals.

And people tend to talk as though an FTA is the only tool we have available in terms of trade liberalisation. It's not.”The focus on a "Golden Era" of relations, trumpeted by China and Britain in 2015 when then-prime minister David Cameron hosted a state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, has cooled under Cameron's successor, Theresa May.In 2016, Mrs May caused a diplomatic spat by unexpectedly deciding to delay approval of a partly-Chinese funded nuclear power project. She later granted it, but not before drawing criticism from Beijing.The PM is expected to visit China later this month accompanied by a business delegation, diplomatic and business sources have told Reuters, though the trip has not been formally confirmed.
