   Protesters were barred from congregating on the Champs Elysees after shops and businesses were looted and destroyed last weekend. Protests were also banned in areas of other cities like Bordeaux, Toulouse and Nice, where President Xi Jinping of China, who is on a tour of Europe, is expected to stay on Sunday. French President Emmanuel Macron has been forced to call in "Operation Sentinelle" military units to prevent a repeat of last week. Around 7,000 soldiers, most armed with automatic weapons, are deployed across France.
