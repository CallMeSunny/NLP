   On Sunday, the ruling Communist Party proposed to remove a constitutional clause limiting presidential service to two terms in office.To do so would mean that Xi - who also heads the party and the military - would technically never have to retire.The immediate and contentious social media reaction urged China to block some articles and publish pieces praising the party.

    The Kim’s family dynasty in North Korea has ruled for decades following Kim Il Sung founded the country in 1948.The Chinese Communist party’s proposal, which will be passed by delegates loyal to the party at next month's annual meeting of China's largely rubber stamp parliament, is part of a package of amendments to the country's constitution.It will also add Xi's political thought to the constitution, following its inclusion in the party constitution last year, and set a legal framework for an anti-corruption super body.In one confusing moment for many Chinese, Xinhua News Agency initially only reported the news in English.State-run newspaper the Global Times said: "Since reform and opening up, China, led by the Communist Party, has successfully resolved and will continue to effectively resolve the issue of party and national leadership replacement in a law-abiding and orderly manner.”The party's official People's Daily reprinted a long article by Xinhua news agency, writing: "The broad part of officials and the masses say that they hoped this constitutional reform is passed.”  GETTYTheresa May at a Tea Ceremony in Mr Jinping's official Diaoyutai State Guesthouse earlier this monthTheir WeChat account, after initially posting a flurry of positive comments under its article, disabled the comments section late Sunday.New party-adoring comments were revealed when the comments section returned on Monday.Joshua Wong, a student activist and politician who serves as secretary-general of pro-democracy party Demosistō, said: "This move, which would allow for a single individual to amass and accumulate political power, means that China would again have a dictator as her head of state - Xi Jinping.”
