We are escorting them]as part of the normal surveillance we have in our territorial waters.”“We sent one unit out to them last night, when they were approaching Danish waters. It will take around a day in total until they leave again near Bornholm, where they entered, and we will escort them the entire way.“Our position is that there is free passage through the Baltic Sea, and the Danish Navy acts as a stopper in the gap. That means we accompany foreign state vessels as part of our surveillance of Danish waters.”He refused to reveal the exact location of the Chinese ships in Danish waters.
