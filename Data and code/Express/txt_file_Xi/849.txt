   Mr Clapper who served under the Obama administration said that North Korea views its nuclear weapons as its “ticket to survival”.He added: “I think our process, our thought process here, ought to be on accepting it and trying to cap it or control it.“A denuclearised North Korea, I would love to see it, but I don’t think it’s in the cards.”North Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in July and there are also reports that they may have nuclear capability.

They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.”These comments were criticised by some as overheated and Mr Clapper similarly called for “more temperate language”.

    The former intelligence chief said: “When I served in Korea many years ago as the director of intelligence US forces in Korea, what I was worried about was an incendiary event getting out of hand.“We can’t know, we don’t understand, exactly what the decision making mechanisms are surrounding Kim Jong-un in North Korea or what would set him off. And that’s why I think many people and myself included would argue for more temperate language than the fire and fury kind of thing.”CIA Director Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that the Trump administration’s goal is to denuclearise the Korean Peninsula.Pompeo defended Trump’s statements, but he said that nuclear conflict is closer than it has been for a long time.
