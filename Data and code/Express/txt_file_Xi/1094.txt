In the EU, we should be wary of the view that during Trump's time the Chinese would be our best friendsGermany’s Green MEP Reinhard ButikoferIn Beijing, the EU chiefs will meet with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Kequiang to review the international scene as well as bilateral relations .Leader of the BDI Joachim Lang, said: “The current escalation between the US and China is worrying.“We call on the US and China to de-escalate the conflict and restore sanity in trade relations, and China now has to tackle criticism from its trading partners, rather than responding only to the new US tariffs.  The leaders gather at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing (Image: GETTY)"It is time to align the opening and reform agenda even more with the market economy and the rule of law."Mr Lang also said: “China has been benefiting from low tariffs, legal certainty and very good conditions for investment and acquisitions in the EU for years.“European companies in China are having a harder time.”The newspaper claims that according to the EU Commission, half of EU companies have complained about increasingly difficult market conditions in China.As a result, the Commission’s President Jean-Claude Juncker demanded at last year’s EU-China summit in Brussels: “Trade must not only be free, but also fair”.

But an open investment environment works best when it is two-way.“In that spirit, I welcome the first exchange of offers that we have made on the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment. This is an important step but only the first one; what we need is an Agreement that fulfils our common ambition and gives investors on both sides predictable and long-term access to our respective markets.”   Topics at the summit will also include the fight against fraud and protection of property rights.The Silk Road Project which refers to the huge infrastructure investments connection Asia, Europe and Africa is expected to be discussed.MEP Butikofer said: “China is trying to set up a court system in Beijing for the Silk Road economic area, then the World Trade Organisation would be replaced by a Chinese court.”Additional reporting by Monika Pallenberg
