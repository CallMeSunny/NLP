  GETTYChina is playing Trump like a drum, according to one economistThe politician repeatedly hit out at the economic policies of the far eastern nation ahead of taking office. And now that markets are anxiously awaiting more details from the new president, there are fears Mr Trump could call China a 'currency manipulator' - a label that would play into their hands, according to Carl Weinberg, founder of research firm High Frequency Economic. The colossal country has recently been trying to keep the yuan strong. But if China allows the currency to weaken this would cause problems for Mr Trump, as it's likely to boost Chinese exports.

"I think the Chinese are playing him like a drum in this regard."Ahead of his inauguration, Mr Trump signalled that the current strength of the dollar is a problem for the US.

    In another clash, last week Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke out in favour of globalisation and against the protectionist policies favoured by Mr Trump. Mr Weinberg added: "Listening to President Xi step right up and say if the U.S. doesn't want to be the hegemon on trade and globalism, then we're happy to step up."That's a big change in the world economic order and I don't see how we can possibly benefit from that.
