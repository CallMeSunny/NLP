  GETTYChinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li KeqiangBeijing’s top economic bureaucrats are trying to convince the world that China will open to trade and investment flows and is willing to integrate further into the global economy.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said China would stick to “free trade” and open up its telecoms, health care, education and new-energy vehicle sectors to foreign investors.In addition, China will remove foreign ownership caps on banks, brokerage houses and fund management firms – a promise made by Beijing during US President Donald Trump’s visit to China in November.That message was underlined by Ning Jizhe, deputy director at the National Development and Reform Commission, the top economic planning agency, when he said the government was considering a slew of measures to widen market access this year.NDRC chief He Lifeng said: “We will embrace an open policy. China’s door of opening will become wider.” Related articles   China spooks US Navy as it spends BILLIONS developing arsenal   India warns Britain AGAINST Brexit trade deal with China in latest ...

But this does not look like bluff to me. They are pretty determined to go down this road.”  REUTERSDelegates in a traditional dress attend the annual Chinese parliamentary sessionMeanwhile, India has issued a stark warning to Britain over striking quick trade deals with “non-democracies” like China after Brexit amid ongoing tensions between the two Asian giants over the contested border known as the Line of Control.Ashish Chauhan, chief executive of the Bombay Exchange, said Britain leaving the EU was both “an opportunity and a threat” to improve trading relations with Asia but he warned the UK not to get “carried away”.He said: “The UK would be better off working with democracies. It’s easy to get carried away with fast results from non-democracies.”When asked to clarify what he meant by “non-democracies”, Mr Chauhan pointed to China.
