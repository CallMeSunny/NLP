  An end to Donald Trump and Xi Jinping's trade war could be in sight (Image: GETTY)The world’s two largest economies have slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods over the last seven months but a deal now appears to be in sight. Negotiators frantically trying to wrap up talks before a March 1 deadline after which US tariffs on Chinese goods will rocket from 10 percent to 25 percent. US and Chinese brokers have begun outlining commitments in principle on the most difficult issues in their trade dispute which has stunted global economic growth, fractured supply chains and stalled manufacturing.

Lower level officials worked on finer details in the US capital on Tuesday and Wednesday before being joined by top level negotiators including US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and China’s vice premier Liu He to continue conversations today.During meetings in Beijing last week, US and Chinese officials exchanged documents outlining obligations and negotiators considered extending their stay in China because such good progress was being made.However they decided to take a few days break and reconvene in Washington this week to thrash out a mechanism aimed at enforcing the obligations.

Negotiators are working to secure a deal before $200 billion of tariffs are stuck on Chinese imports (Image: GETTY)One Tuesday, Mr Trump told reporters in the Oval Office “they're trying to move fast so that doesn't happen” but left the possibility of extending the date at which $200 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese imports would be imposed.According to a source, “core demands” of both countries are still being narrowed and Chinese commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng declined to comment on the MOUs.However stocks across the globe soared on news a deal could be made, hitting a four-month high.Stocks started with a rally in Asia that pushed the MSCI world equity index to its highest since October and European stock indexes also strengthened.
