  GettyQueen Victoria's statue in Victoria Park was covered up the day before Xi Jinxing's visitOrganisers behind a science exposition, said to be pro-Beijing, placed boards and a banner around Victoria Park in central Hong Kong so the statue of the late queen could not be seen.The Hong Kong Celebrations Association was branded “petty” for the move by a local councillor.Clarisse Yeung Suet-ying, Wan Chai district councillor, saw two rows of boards surrounding the bronze statue which has stood at the park’s main entrance since 1955.It was moved from Statue Square in central Hong Kong where it was installed in 1896 to commemorate the former queen’s Golden Jubilee.

    Ms Yeung, told the South China Morning Post: “If that was the plan, it was just too petty. “They can’t even face the city’s colonial past.”Cheung Yiu-tong, the organisers’ chairman, said they had not meant to block the statue.He said: “We were planning to put up a plan of the science expo on the board. It turned out to have blocked the statue, but that was not our idea.”     Facebook•Clarisse YeungThe boards and banner covered the statue of Queen VictoriaA spokesman from the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, said one of its staff members had seen the boards around the statue while patrolling on Tuesday and immediately contacted the organisers to find out why.They then removed the structures.Despite denying the structures were put up to purposefully cover up Queen Victoria, Hong Kongers used to Beijing’s posturing hit out at the Chinese government.One Facebook user, said: “Obviously they don’t want President Xi to be able to see the relic of the colonial era.”  Clarisse YeungThe boards were put up for a science expo, but the banners said they were celebrating the Handover  GettyThe statue of Queen Victoria was originally in Statue Square in central Hong KongAnother said: “Can’t accommodate an old bronze statue? Their pathetically little tolerance.” One user suggested: “Why don’t they tear the statue down?”July 1, 1997, marked the end of Britain’s 99-years of rule over the prosperous island nation to the south of China.The date is widely seen as the end of the British empire.Under the Sino-British Join Declaration, China promised to leave Hong Kong’s capitalist system in place for at least 50 years after the Handover.However, this has widely been seen to have not happened as Beijing imposes its force on the city, especially its democratic voting system which prompted the Umbrella Revolution in 2014.
