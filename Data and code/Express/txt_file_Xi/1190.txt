  GETTYScotland's steel industry has been crippled by the closure of two plants in LanarkshireOwner Tata announced plans yesterday to mothball the Dalzell plate rolling works in Motherwell and Clydebridge plant in Cambuslang, both in Lanarkshire.The Indian giant blamed the cuts on a flood of cheap imports from China, a strong pound and high electricity costs.It heaped pressure on Prime Minister David Cameron to tackle the Chinese over their aggressive steel pricing following a wave of cuts at plants across the UK.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon set up a task force aimed at finding new owners for the sites.But Tata chiefs said they had already tried to find a buyer for them and were “pessimistic” the plants would ever reopen.The events of what union chiefs branded a “dark day” effectively end production at the country’s last two major steelworks. The UK steel industry is struggling for survival in the face of extremely challenging market conditionsKarl Koehler, Tata European chief executiveTata said 225 jobs would go in Motherwell and 45 in Cambuslang as part of 1,170 lay-offs. The brunt of the cuts will hit Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, where 900 posts will go.Scots workers yesterday said they had little hope of a rescue.John McKenna, who worked at Ravenscraig before it closed in 1992 and joined Dalzell eight years ago, said: “It is terrible the way we are being treated and for me the steel industry in Scotland is now finished.”Karl Koehler, chief executive of Tata’s European operations, said the firm had looked at all options and would work with unions to help staff.He added: “The UK steel industry is struggling for survival in the face of extremely challenging market conditions. The European Commission needs to do much more to deal with unfairly traded imports.”Human resources director Tor Farquhar said he was “pessimistic” the mothballed plants would reopen. “It’s a very difficult decision and one we fought against but the global macroeconomic picture means we can’t find a viable way of production,” he said. About 5,200 jobs have been lost in the UK steel industry in the past fortnight after the closure of SS in Redcar and Caparo’s announcement of 1,800 job cuts. Mr Cameron has pledged to raise the issue of cheap imports with Chinese premier Xi Jinping on his state visit to the UK.Responding to a question in the House of Commons, Business Secretary Sajid Javid told steelworkers: “We will not abandon you now in your greatest time of need.”Announcing her task force, Ms Sturgeon said she will be visiting the plants tomorrow. “My Government is determined to fight for a future for our steel industry,” she said. “We will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to keep the plants open and support the staff affected.”Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said: “The workers at the Dalzell and Clydebridge plants are highly skilled and make a valuable contribution to our communities. These skills cannot be allowed to wither on the vine.”Ross Clark, the Community union’s lead representative at the Dalzell plant, said: “The task force must deliver on the promises the Scottish Government has made in recent days to save our steel.”
