   Mr Xi’s speech at Davos came after a backlash against globalisation in the West, epitomised by the Brexit vote and Donald Trump’s election. It is the first time that a Chinese leader has appeared at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Mr Xi told the forum: "We should commit ourselves to growing an open global economy to share opportunities and interests through opening-up and achieve win-win outcomes.

No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war."   EPAChina's President Xi Jinping in Bern yesterday during a two-day visit to SwitzerlandWho Xi Jinping? The Chinese President was appointed in 2012 and has managed to his concentrate power in his hands, taking control of the economy and other issues. Mr Xi has been dubbed the ‘chairman of everything’ and there is a growing a personality cult around the strongman leader in China.  The son of one of China’s founding revolutionary heroes has carried out a fierce anti-corruption drive during his time in power.     He became the party general secretary and head of its military commission in November 2012, four months before becoming President.Mr Xi is set to cement his power during the Chinese leadership turnover around the 19th Communist Party Congress later this year.Global consultancy the Eurasia Group has said that two of the biggest political risks facing the world in 2017 flow from this consolidation of power. Its latest report said: “First, because Xi will be extremely sensitive to external challenges to his country's interests at a time when all eyes are on his leadership, the Chinese president will be more likely than ever to respond forcefully to foreign policy challenges.  Inside China's Military Superpower Sat, November 11, 2017An inside view of the Chinese military over 120 years.

    “Spikes in US-China tensions are the likely outcome."Second, by prioritising stability over difficult policy choices in the run-up to the party congress, Xi may unwittingly increase the chances of significant policy failures.”  The incoming US President campaigned on a promise to confront China more aggressively on trade. Before his election, Mr Trump pledged to label China a currency manipulator. But he now plans to "talk to them first".He has also broken with decades of US protocol by taking a telephone call from the President of Taiwan, which Beijing sees as part of China. The US has historically had formal ties with China, not the island of Taiwan, under its longstanding One China policy. China has rejected Mr Trump’s assertion that "everything is under negotiation, including One China".
