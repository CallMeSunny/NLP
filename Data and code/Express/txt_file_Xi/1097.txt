   Mr Hammond visits Beijing this week at a crucial time when the escalation of tit-for-tat tariffs battles between China and the US read like a Hollywood movie script as President Trump moves the world ever closer to a full-blown trade war.The escalating tensions gives the Chancellor - ironically nicknamed ‘Box Office Phil’ - his best chance yet to inject new urgency into the long-running economic talks between the two nations.The UK and China have found themselves as the world’s leading, albeit somewhat unexpected, advocates for free trade following President Trump’s protectionist stance and the EU’s struggles with exports and internal migration issues.With China looking for new allies in the wake of the Trump tariffs affair, its relationship with the UK has taken on new importance for Britain as it looks to re-invent itself as a global trading nation after Brexit.

Britain is committed to promoting free and open trade, and as Britain and its European cooperation partners form a new relationship, we will deepen our relations with other regions around the worldChancellor Philip HammondWriting in Chinese financial magazine Caixin Mr Hammond signalled what he called “globalised Britain’s” support for free trade.He said: “During this visit to China, I will meet with Chinese leaders in order to clearly convey a message to the outside world - as a firm supporter of trade liberalisation and a free market, the United Kingdom is China’s long-term trusted partner.“Britain is committed to promoting free and open trade, and as Britain and its European cooperation partners form a new relationship, we will deepen our relations with other regions around the world.”Both Mr Hammond and Prime Minister Theresa May have eyed a trade deal with China as a massive boost to Britain’s Brexit ambitions and progress in talks at this stage could give the UK added confidence and leverage in forthcoming negotiations with the EU.

Ahead of the trip she said she would “intensify the 'Golden Era' in UK-China relations”.However there remains plenty of work to be done and Mr Hammond will look to the progress made during his visit to last year’s Beijing summit celebrating President Xi Jinping’s landmark Belt and Road infrastructure program to build a new Silk Road, which has aroused suspicion in some Western capitals that it is more about expanding China’s influence than anything else.Mr Hammond said: “Britain is an ideal cooperation partner to turn Belt and Road into a globally recognised asset class via London’s position as a global financial hub.“We hope that Britain can grasp the unlimited opportunities brought by the Belt and Road initiative, and take a lead in its financing work.”  Chancellor Hammond is looking for a Brexit boost from China (Image: GETTY)
