   Queen Elizabeth II had her wedding to Prince Philip in November 1947. In honour of the day, the former Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten bought Her Majesty a bracelet as a gift.The large diamond bracelet was a fitting wedding gift for a member of the royal family, as it was made from the same diamonds as the Queen’s engagement ring.These sparkling gems were taken from a tiara owned by Prince Philip’s mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg.The tiara was dismantled to create his wife’s engagement ring, and later her wedding present.
