    Describing the “positive atmosphere” between the two, a senior Government official said: “The President made clear that he believed the UK would thrive outside the European Union.”The pair agreed to prioritise work on the trade deal so it can be completed “as soon as possible” after Brexit.They also pledged to look at areas where trade can be deepened before Britain quits the EU.Mrs May said afterwards: “We are optimistic and positive about this.”  GETTYMrs May met with President Trump during the G20 summitInternational Trade Secretary Liam Fox will begin trade talks with US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who was present at the meeting, on July 24.Mr Trump’s upbeat remarks are in stark contrast to his predecessor, Barack Obama, who warned that Britain would be “at back of the queue” for a trade deal with the US if it voted to leave the EU.He also told Mrs May he had “a tremendous meeting” with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday.Afterwards Mr Putin said: “TV Trump is very different from the real Trump, from the Trump I had before me.”Mr Trump’s comments came the day after China’s President Xi Jinping told Mrs May that Brexit could be a global force for good.
