  GETTYSir Martin Moore-Bick will head the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fireBut "the crime of being white" is surely the only way to interpret the backlash that has accompanied the announcement that retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick will head the inquiry into the horrific Grenfell Tower tragedy.From the moment Sir Martin, who has been described as being "highly respected and hugely experienced" by Prime Minister Theresa May, was handed the job of finding out how at least 80 people lost their lives in what clearly would appear to be an accident waiting to happen, there has been a ceaseless barrage of criticism.

He has handed down judgments in the past that have discriminated against tenants, agreeing that one had to be moved from Westminster to Milton Keynes.This neatly ignores the plain fact that any judge with his lengthy track record would have been bound to have handed down verdicts or sentences that caused controversy and resentment.

    This judge's latest misdemeanour is his gender, skin colour and background. That would seem to be the case if you listen to Labour MP David Lammy.Lammy said: "He is a white, uppermiddle class man who I suspect has never, ever visited a tower block housing estate and certainly hasn't slept the night on the 20th floor of one."Lammy went on: "It is a shame we could not find a woman to lead this inquiry or indeed an ethnic minority to lead the inquiry in 2017." Then, most damning of all as he is questioning the retired judge's impartiality, he said: "I think the victims will also say to themselves, when push comes to shove, there are some powerful people here - contractors, sub-contractors, local authorities, governments - and they look like this judge. Whose side will he be on?" It is incredible that Lammy, a man who went on to be a barrister, could be responsible for such nonsense.   Is he really saying that Sir Martin is nothing more than a successful and well-educated patsy who will cower in the face of big business or be diffident to local or central government? ow crass and offensive.Had Lammy bothered to do just a smidgen of research he would have discovered that Sir Martin was not born into the lap of luxury, knowing a life of Eton and privilege awaited him.His father was a dairyman and his mother was a teacher. Born in Wales, the family moved to England where Sir Martin excelled at school and won a place at a grammar in Tunbridge Wells.From there he went on to Cambridge and his impressive career began.Oafish Lammy appears to be suggesting you can only be empathetic to people if you have lived their lives, which is astonishing from someone supposedly so legally skilled. That means rape cases could only be heard by rape survivors and it would be helpful if you are sitting in judgment of a murderer that one of your family had been lost to murder.  GETTYHe has been described as a 'highly respected and hugely experienced' by Theresa MayHis comments have been picked up enthusiastically by Grenfell action groups where there is more than a whiff of class war at work.Indeed due to the rising tensions in the area Lammy's willingness to play the race and class card, supported by the newly elected local Labour MP Emma Dent Coad, is even more questionable.If you are in court any time soon (and I really hope that you're not) imagine the reaction if you saw a black female judge and you demanded a white male one as you believed there was no way she would be able to empathise with you. It is rightly unacceptable in any other walk of life so why over Grenfell? Perhaps Lammy should try studying some recent history and reflect on remarks made by Martin Luther King. He said: "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character." It is time to stop judging the judge and let him get on with his unenviable task.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Charlie Gard: A timeline of the heartbreaking case Mon, July 24, 2017Charlie Gard timeline: A parents struggle to save their son.

    It is one of the most complex stories of recent times: desperately ill 11-month-old Charlie Gard is being kept alive despite court rulings upholding the NHS's belief that he should be allowed to die as further treatment would cause him suffering.Tomorrow the High Court will make a fresh ruling after Great Ormond Street hospital, where he is a patient, applied for another hearing after "claims of new expert evidence" on the experimental treatment suggested.Two of the planet's most powerful men have supported the parents' plea to be allowed to take their child to the US for a treatment they know might not work.Pope Francis has said his own hospital in Rome would treat the boy and President Trump has tweeted his support.The public too has raised more than £1million to help him.In the face of all of this, one simple question: if the treatment was allowed to proceed, what's to lose?-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  GETTY - STOCK The Care Quality Commission set out the state of elderly care in the UKThe report into elderly care homes made for particularly grim reading.The Care Quality Commission highlighted egregious examples of supposed "care" such as administering out-of-date medicines, unqualified care staff and managers unable to name a single resident.While the staff must shoulder some of the blame don't you think if some of the managers and, in particular, the owners were forced to spend a few nights in the homes they run or own, things might change rather rapidly?-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Can there be a more lame excuse for failing to erect a statue of the late Margaret Thatcher than claiming it is feared it could be vandalised by Left-wingers? The application to Westminster Council requests permission for a statue showing the nation's first female prime minister in a "resolute position looking towards Parliament with a stern gaze".However a residents' association has successfully argued that it could be a target for vandals. This is a ludicrously dangerous precedent. If any group opposes anything in the future it merely has to say it could be vandalised.The statue must proceed, covered extensively with CCTV cameras, and anyone caught defacing it instantly arrested and charged accordingly.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   The situation in North Korea has moved from troubling to petrifying. If diplomacy is to ever have a role now is the time. However it is worth remembering the meeting in Florida of US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. That ended with effusive promises from Jinping that he would do all he could to bring North Korea to heel.Now China is both part of the problem and part of the solution. Along with Russia they cannot be allowed to hide behind vetoes or abstentions at the UN Security Council.Live feed from Love Island. Brilliant!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------While the crackdown on charities' obsession with pestering potential donors is admirable, the idea of fining repeat offenders is plain nuts. In some instances those fines could be £25,000.However the cash will effectively be paid by those kind enough to give to the charity in the first place.Surely the answer is to fine the executives running the charity and let them take it out of their often very weighty pay packets.
