   Beijing military officials accused the US of having large, negative influence on military trust with China through “wrong” actions – including arms sales to Taiwan and the deployment of the THAAD missile system, which serves as a deterrent to North Korea.Fan Changlong, a vice chairman of China's powerful Central Military Commission, told the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford, that mutual trust mechanisms between the two militaries had continued to improve.He added: “But wrong actions on the Taiwan issue, the United States deploying the THAAD system around China, US ships and aircraft's activities in the South China Sea, the United States close-in surveillance in the sea and air near China have had a large, negative influence on bilateral military ties and mutual trust.”THAAD, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence anti-missile system the US has deployed in South Korea, is one of the nation’s main deterrents against the warmongering ways of Kim Jong-un.

      GETTYTensions have run high between the world's two largest economies since the election of Donald TrumpBut the Trump administration also has reservations about Beijing’s approach, expressing concern about what it calls unsafe intercepts of US aircraft by the Chinese air force and a lack of transparency in military spending.It comes as China and Russia unite in a bid to force Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump to “hit the brakes” after a month of provocative rhetoric.Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi laid down a stark warning as he called on Russia to unite with the eastern superpower to prevent an “August crisis”.His comments are believed to be a reference to the July Crisis, the name given to the series of events which triggered the start of World War One.

    Speaking with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, Mr Wang said: “The most important task for the US and North Korea is to ‘hit the brakes’ on their mutual needling of each other with words and actions, to lower the temperature of the tense situation and prevent an ‘August crisis’.”He added the two nations should work together and not allow anyone to "stir up an incident on their doorstep”.Sergei Lavrov responded by calling for tensions on the Korean peninsula to be “peacefully resolved”.He said: “A resolution of the North Korea nuclear issue by military force is completely unacceptable and the peninsula’s nuclear issue must be peacefully resolved by political and diplomatic methods."
