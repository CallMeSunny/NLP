  GETTYNorth Korea is arming children and teaching them how to hack computersLieutenant General In-Bum Chun, one of South Korea’s most decorated military leaders in history, claims a 14-year-old North Korean gets more than 100 hours of military training each year.This means by the time they reach conscription age and serve their time in the military they are able to fire an array of weapons, including an AK-47 machine gun, as well as launch grenades and effectively fend for themselves.He said: “North Korea is very militarised, far beyond any imagination of western powers.“The entire country is like a barracks.

GETTYNorth Korea is "like a barracks" said the South Korean general   "We can be as sure as possible - I can't obviously go into the detailed intelligence  - but it is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea had taken this role."Pressed on the security minister's comments, a Downing Street spokeswoman said she would not get into detailed discussion on cyber attacks, nor whether the UK government had approached North Korean representatives with its concerns.  GETTYSouth Korea and North Korea recently held talks to reduce tensionsShe said: ”But there have been reports from various sources that have attributed that attack to a group known as Lazarus who are believed to operate in North Korea.”Mr Wallace suggested the attack was motivated by North Korea's need for foreign funds.This view appears to be supported by LG Chun, who said when he sees reports of foreign banks losing millions of dollars he assumes North Korea is in some way responsible.Tensions have reduced in recent days after South Korea began talks with the North over the nuclear threat.As part of the discussions North Korea has said its sportspeople will compete in next month's Winter Olympics, which will be held in South Korea.Chinese President Xi Jinping today welcomed the progress of negotiations.
