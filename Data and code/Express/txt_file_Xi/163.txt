Bhutan said last week that the road was being built inside its territory.Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are attending a summit of the G20 group of nations in the German city of Hamburg later this week.Mr Geng would not comment on whether the two could meet there, saying bilateral meetings for Xi at the summit were being arranged.
