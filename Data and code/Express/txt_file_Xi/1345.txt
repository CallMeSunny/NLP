    var brightcoveBrandsafety='4 Sport and specialist news &ndash; passed for ad targeting' The ongoing trade battle between the United States and China is worrying Wall Street analysts, who are concerned some sectors will be adversely impacted as a result. Retail, auto vehicles, auto parts, and semiconductors are at most risk according to analysts, as the trade-war could have “material (and potentially far-reaching) ramifications”. Some analysts are hopeful for a deal, whilst others are waiting for China to retaliate before recommending action and others are anticipating an “all-out trade war”.

These massive payments go directly to the Treasury of the US.“The process has begun to place additional Tariffs at 25% on the remaining 325 Billion Dollars.“The US only sells China approximately 100 Billion Dollars of goods & products, a very big imbalance.“With the over 100 Billion Dollars in Tariffs that we take in, we will buy agricultural products from our Great Farmers, in larger amounts than China ever did, and ship it to poor & starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance.

Our Farmers will do better, faster, and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted, or go to new source!“If we bought 15 Billion Dollars of Agriculture from our Farmers, far more than China buys now, we would have more than 85 Billion Dollars left over for new Infrastructure, Healthcare, or anything else. China would greatly slow down, and we would automatically speed up!”However, to get anywhere in negotiations Mr Clothier says President Trump needs to keep aware of the Chinese culture as there are “many nuances and processes within Chinese culture that must be respected, especially when it comes to business and negotiations, and observing hierarchy and showing respect are paramount”.
