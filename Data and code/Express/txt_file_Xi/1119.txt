  GETTYDonald Trump recently refused  to open the new US embassy in LondonThe US President’s unenviable qualities have been on display in recent days from his refusal to open the new US embassy in London to reports of his racist remarks about Haiti and some African nations.Yet love or loathe him we have to deal with him. It is all too easy to grandstand but this is the real world.President Trump is the elected leader of one of the world’s great democracies – a long-time ally of Britain.To ignore the influence of the global superpower is disingenuous posturing as well as being wilfully naive.

    Many may disagree with President Trump’s views but there are also those who find the stance taken by Jeremy Corbyn hypocritical in the extreme.Consider his past association with the IRA, including hosting two convicted Republican terrorists in the House of Commons just weeks after the Brighton bombing, to describing the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah as his “friends”.As recently as 2015, the Labour leader happily cosied up to Chinese President Xi Jinping despite the regime’s human rights record being described as the worst since the Tiananmen crackdown. As is ever the case with the Left, there is one rule for Labour and another for everyone else.Now is the time for grown-up politics. While the President of the United States may sometimes behave in an undignified manner, we must never lose respect for the office he holds.----------------------------------------------  PABlack-cab rapist John Worboys is to be released just a yearRemember his victimsIt is deeply troubling that black-cab rapist John Worboys is to be released just a year after a proposed move to an open prison was rejected.What changed so much within 12 months that it was deemed safe to allow this sexual predator to freely walk the streets?After all, in 2015 Worboys was still in denial of his heinous crimes by appealing his sentence.This case underlines the urgent need for much greater transparency around how decisions are reached by the Parole Board.As it stands, this latest revelation will only fuel the bewilderment and distress of victims, already deeply traumatised by their ordeal.Their feelings must not be forgotten in the bureaucracy of justice.----------------------------------------------  GETTYThe Brussels bloc has a great deal to lose from a no-deal scenario Let’s call the EU’s bluffIf David Davis is to embody his “gangster” nickname, then he really does need to make the EU an offer they can’t refuse.Contrary to Project Fear claims, the latest figures suggest the Brussels bloc has a great deal to lose from a no-deal scenario while the UK has everything to gain from branching out as a global free trade nation.Instead of treating Brexit as a damage limitation exercise, the Government needs to start accentuating the positives of leaving the EU, deal or no deal.Optimism and ambition are key to securing the best possible outcome for Britain.
