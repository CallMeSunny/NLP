  GETTYUS President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet next weekSecuring agreement on the purchase of 22 unarmed drones, worth more than $2 billion, is seen in New Delhi as a key test of defence ties that flourished under former President Barack Obama but have drifted under President Trump, who has courted Asian rival China as he seeks Beijing's help to contain North Korea's nuclear programme. The deal would still require approval by Congress. California-based General Atomics, the maker of the Guardian drone sought by India, declined to comment.  Related articles   India to overtake UK on defence spending in just THREE YEARS   North Korean life revealed as tensions with US threaten to boil over Modi's two-day visit to Washington begins on Sunday. President Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in April and has also had face time with the leaders of nations including Japan, Britain and Vietnam since taking office in January, prompting anxiety in New Delhi that India is no longer a priority in Washington. The Indian navy wants the unarmed surveillance drones to keep watch over the Indian Ocean.   GETTY - STOCK IMAGEThe US is expected to authorise India’s purchase of a naval variant of the Predator drone    We are trying to move it to the top of the agenda as a deliverableIndian officiaThe deal would be the first such purchase by a country that is not a member of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. “We are trying to move it to the top of the agenda as a deliverable, this is something that can happen before all the other items,” said an Indian official tracking the progress of the drone discussions in the run-up to the visit.   GETTYModi's two-day visit to Washington begins on SundayIndia, a big buyer of US arms that was recently named by Washington as a major defence ally, wants to protect its 4,700-mile coastline as Beijing expands its maritime trade routes and Chinese submarines increasingly lurk in regional waters. But sources tracking the discussions say the US State Department has been concerned about the potential destabilising impact of introducing high-tech drones into South Asia, where tensions are simmering between India and Pakistan, particularly over Kashmir, which is divided between them.  Donald Trump's most iconic photographs Wed, June 14, 2017The U.S. President as you've never seen him before!

    Such a sale of sensitive military hardware must be authorised by the State Department before being sent to Congress for review. A congressional source said no notification of a planned sale has yet been sent to Congress, but this could come next week. The State Department declined comment ahead of any notification. Other strains have emerged in US-India relations, with the United States vexed by a growing bilateral trade deficit and Trump accusing New Delhi of negotiating unscrupulously at the Paris climate talks to walk away with billions in aid.   GETTYPresident Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in AprilUS officials expect a relatively low-key visit by Modi, without the fanfare of some of his previous trips to the United States, and one geared to giving the Indian leader the chance to get to know Trump personally and to show that he is doing so. Mr Modi is also not expected to press hard on a US visa programme the Trump administration is reviewing to reduce the flow of skilled foreign workers and save jobs for Americans, seeing limited gains from raising a sensitive issue, they said.
