Mr Putin, who is armed forces commander-in-chief, is observing the exercises this week alongside Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, who is overseeing them.Mr Shoigu has said they are the biggest since a Soviet military exercise, Zapad-81 (West-81) in 1981.By contrast, Mr Trump shelved plans for joint military exercises with South Korean forces earlier this year after his meeting with North Korea’s supreme leader Kim Jong-un.Mr Trump later said the “war-games” – as he described them – would have been “provocative”.Mr Putin and Mr Jinping were pictured yesterday cooking pancakes with caviar in a bizarre photo opportunity yesterday.
