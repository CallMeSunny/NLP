   Yeonmi Park is 23 years old but the North Korean defector has made it her mission to give her former countrymen and women a voice, no matter the personal cost.“Yes it is scary because he doesn’t care who he kills – he even killed his own brother, Kim Jong Nam – but the world needs to hear our story,” she says. In the week that President Trump met China’s president Xi Jinping to discuss North Korea and its everlooming threat as a nuclear powerhouse, Yeonmi is worried that the 24.9 million oppressed and desperate North Koreans – many tortured or starving – are being forgotten amid the wrangling over trade agreements and arms treaties.

      GETTYNorth Korea defector Yeonmi Park, 23, fled the oppressive dictatorship with her parents“There are no comparisons to how North Koreans are treated,” she says. “We are treated worse than animals. Animals have better rights.”  There was nothing else to eat, no food left. All I knew was China had lights and we did notYeonmi ParkYeonmi was born into a middle class family in Hyesan City in the northern part of Ryanggang province in 1993. Her mother was a nurse for the North Korean army and her father was a civil servant. Their situation allowed them basic amenities and, for her, a basic education. This all changed when her father was arrested for trading metal illegally with the Chinese. He was sentenced to hard labour while Yeonmi, her mother, and older sister Eunm were punished and relegated to the lowest class and subsistence. “Once my father was sent to prison we were also treated like criminals. In North Korea they have a class system so I could not do anything outside that.“I could not marry above my class or imagine living in Pyongyang (North Korea’s capital, largely populated by those high up in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as well as relations of and those loyal to Kim Jong-il). I couldn’t even go to university or school. There was no way I could have a middle class life.” Banished to concrete housing in the mountains, ice cold one season, boiling hot the next, forbidden an education or well paid work, her family’s life was purely about survival.“Every day I wondered if I was going to stay alive or not,” she recalls. “Food was limited as everyone was hungry and people like us, who were in the bottom class, were starving. “My mother traded in the market but this was not enough. So we had to find food in the mountains, eating dragonflies and grasshoppers and plants – anything to stay alive.”Normal childhood activities were restricted so there was little singing, dancing or even laughter.   GETTYShe worries North Koreans are being forgotten amid wrangling over trade agreements and arms treaties“We were only allowed to sing songs that worshipped the leaders; anything else was forbidden. Nor could we dance like people [in the West] who go clubbing. You could only do a military dance that was created by the government.” Yeonmi describes growing up in a Big Brother state, watched by police and spies; the smallest offence leading to public execution or imprisonment. “Everyone is so scared of doing something wrong as public execution is part of daily life. People would disappear in my neighbourhood all the time and we didn’t know why. I used to believe Kim Jong-il could read my mind. You didn’t decide whether to obey or not. There was no questioning, you just obeyed.” Yeonmi was forced to witness as her friend’s mother was publicly executed for watching a Hollywood film: “She made the mistake of lending it to friends,” she says.“In North Korea it doesn’t matter how old children are. Toddlers, secondary school pupils, people of all ages have to watch the executions. Attendance is mandatory.”With no internet, mobile phones and hardly any electricity, North Koreans live in darkness and constant terror.   “If you see the satellite images of North Korea it’s the darkest place on Earth today,” says Yeonmi.  “Electricity only came on about once a month so technology was never part of my life. We had one channel on TV.” The people are controlled so completely that even the language is policed, with the dictatorship banning words that described any feeling: “In North Korea we don’t really have words such as depression or stress, so these things make no sense to us. How can you ever be depressed or stressed if you have never heard a word to describe that feeling. And of course there is no such phrase as ‘human rights’. Even though I was living in the most oppressed country I didn’t know what the word oppressed was.” The government convinced Yeonmi to believe every place outside North Korea was evil: “I only knew of a few countries. Americans were known as ‘American *******s’. I had no idea about Europe.”  GETTYYeonmi escaped North Korea in 2007 when it was under the rule of Kim Jong-ilIn 2007 aged 13, Yeonmi decided to escape; not for freedom (as she didn’t know what that meant) but due to hunger: “There was nothing else to eat, no food left. All I knew was that China had lights and we didn’t. “I thought the light coming from there meant I might be able to find something to eat. I didn’t go to be free. I just wanted some food.” Her family fled to China, where Yoenmi and her mother fell into the hands of human traffickers. She watched as her mother was raped and when her father died at 45 had to bury his body in secret so as not to alert the authorities to their presence in the country.After two years in hiding, she and her mother journeyed across the Gobi Desert to seek asylum in Mongolia from South Korean diplomats. Yeonmi’s sister had fled China a week before and remained lost to them for seven years until they were reunited in South Korea three years ago. Looking back at her childhood in North Korea, Yeonmi says: “I was brainwashed, I didn’t know I was living in an oppressed country.   GETTYShe now spends her time travelling around the world speaking on behalf of those she left behind“I never knew I was a slave to the government. There is no comparison to what it is like living there, everything was different except that I was breathing.” Yeonmi, who has publicly condemned Kim Jong-un for abusing his own people, has three simple messages for the politicians haggling over her homeland’s future: “Firstly, North Korea isn’t just about the weapons, it’s about the population.“The news always talks about the dictator and his bombs, never about the people. I hope the world will give North Korean people a voice.” “Secondly, if North Koreans escape to China, China doesn’t protect them and often sends them back to torture and death. We need to stop China doing this.” Finally, Yeonmi states: “China is why Kim is alive today. Without them, North Korea would not survive. We need to condemn China for trading with North Korea and helping the dictator, because they are the only country with direct contact. It is very important to spread this message. “It is why I am willing to risk my life by telling their story.”
