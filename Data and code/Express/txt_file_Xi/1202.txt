    "Millions of people across China want the cruel dog meat trade to end, and they are incredibly angry and upset to have their much-loved pets stolen by dog thieves. "The annual Yulin dog slaughter is a hideous event, deliberate cruelty to animals in the name of a festival. I hope the Chinese authorities shut it down for good.”Claire Bass, executive director of HSI/UK, explained: “We hope to gather millions of signatures against the grisly Yulin Festival. "Across the world, people are uniting to urge Xi Jingping to direct resources to end the cruel and largely illegal dog meat trade. Our call for action will only get stronger, as we stand united with our Chinese partner groups in saying we must #StopYulin.”See: https://action.hsi.org/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=104&ea.campaign.id=38221&ea.tracking.id=wh_celeb
