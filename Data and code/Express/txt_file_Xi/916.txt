   Speaking to CNBC, the portfolio manager at Conning Asia Pacific said the UK financial services may have an opening to gain a foothold in China post-Brexit.Mr Franklin explained how China recently expressed its will to relinquish control over foreign ownership of financial entities. This would give UK firms to partner up with Chinese businesses while retaining full non-EU dependent control over the terms of new financial deals.He said: “The UK’s economy has been driven by the service’s sector, through financial and non-financial services, over the last few years.

Formal talks cannot begin until the UK officially leaves the EU, but this step could give the UK added confidence and leverage in negotiations with the EU.Free trade talks also typically take years to conclude. Mr Zhong also said he hoped that Britain would use the opportunity of a major import fair in November in Shanghai, which President Xi Jinping is overseeing, to expand its exports to China.Dr Fox will lead Britain’s delegation in November to the import fair along with Prince Andrew.The Trade Secretary said his goal is to boost exports to 35 percent of the gross domestic product after leaving the EU.
