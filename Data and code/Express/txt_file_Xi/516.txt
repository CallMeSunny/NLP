    “China can fix this problem easily and quickly and I am calling on China and your great president to hopefully work on it very hard.“If he works on it hard, it will happen, there's no doubt about it.”China has previously rejected calls from the US to take a more active role in the de-nuclearisation of its neighbouring state and did not respond to Mr Trump’s latest comments.
