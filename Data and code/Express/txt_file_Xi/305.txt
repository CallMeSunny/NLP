    China has long been referred to as the solution to tension on the Korean peninsula - Beijing is the country’s sole ally and accounts for most of its trade.However, Chinese foreign ministry senior fellow Yang Xiyu believes China’s grip on the situation is slipping, citing the country as having “no control on the issue”.He stated: "No matter whether there is war or peace, regretfully, China has no control, dominance or even a voice on the issue.”   Zhu Feng, a professor at Nanjing University, piled on fears of World War 3 during the conference by demanding that Chinese President Xi Jinping prepare for “a catastrophic nuclear conflict, nuclear fallout or a nuclear explosion”.He continued: "Why do we always act like ostriches?"Why do we always believe a war won't occur?"  GETTYChina has been told to 'mobilise its defences' for war with North Korea at any timeAs China soaks up criticism for its approach towards North Korea, an associate professor of political science at Temple University in Japan has stated that Russia’s recent chastising of US foreign policy against Kim Jong-un may lead to a change of approach from Donald Trump.Dr James Brown said: "President Putin really gave quite strong criticism of the US position, indeed saying that the US had provoked North Korea's actions. Many people are coming around to the view that that's essentially correct.“US policy of maximum pressure on North Korea has clearly not led to the results they were looking for.  GETTYShi Yinhong explained that the time for preventing an all-out war with Kim Jong-un has passed“The hope that North Korea could be persuaded to turn toward denuclearisation has not happened.“Instead, North Korea has been incentivised to try and gain full nuclear capabilities as quickly as possible.“It's difficult to know the exact US position, because there's been a lack of clarity on this. But this does seem to indicate that the White House is willing to cooperate on the issue, and it may even be coming around to Russia's position.”
