  Getty China and North Korea: Whose side is China on? How will Beijing act now? Kim Jong-un has reportedly evacuated 600,000 residents from Pyongyang as tensions with the US escalate.Around 25 per cent of the capital’s population has been told to leave, Russian newspaper Pravda Report has said.Meanwhile satellite images appear to show that North Korea is preparing to launch a nuclear weapons test.North 38 reports that the images show “continued activity” at the site, which appears to be “primed and ready” for what would be the hermit state’s sixth nuclear test.Pyongyang has slammed ‘reckless moves’ by the US and pledged to defend the North Korea from invasion ‘by powerful force of arms’, according to the nation's state media. A Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying: “We will hold the US wholly accountable for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by its outrageous actions.” Related articles   USA v North Korea? Will the US attack North Korea?    Donald Trump 'more like to start war with North Korea than Syria' Tensions have escalated after America bombed a Syrian airbase last week and deployed a US Navy strike group towards the Korean peninsula in a show of force. Donald Trump has also pushed Chinese President Xi Jinping to do more to rein in North Korea, which sends a vast majority of its exports to its giant neighbour across the Yellow Sea. After the leaders met in Florida last week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the press that Mr Xi understands that “action has to be taken” to address the North Korea threat.   But Mr Xi did not make any public commitment on North Korea. During his visit, the Syrian airbase bombing showed the US is willing to use force to enforce international norms.  On Monday China and South Korea agreed to slap tougher sanctions on North Korea if the country carries out nuclear or long-range missile tests, according to an official in Seoul. Although China has long been North Korea’s most important trading partner and ally, it is now taking a tougher line on Kim Jong-un’s reclusive regime.  Former MI6 head John Sawers has said that there needs to be a joint US-China response to deal with North Korea in order to avoid conflict on the peninsula.    “The Chinese have taken a tougher approach on North Korea recently,” he told BBC Radio Four’s Today programme.  “They have enforced more strict sanctions on the North Korean regime. There is a rather frosty approach by Beijing to Kim Jong-un.” He said there is “common ground” between the US and China because neither of the countries want North Korea to have nuclear weapons.  He added: “I think what the Chinese are beginning to understand is that if this can’t be solved peaceably through negotiations, through pressure, then there is serious risk that the US will have only one option left, which is the military option.” Inside North Korea: The pictures Kim Jong-un doesn't want you to see Thu, March 8, 2018Photographer Eric Lafforgue ventured to North Korea six times.

    A fleet of North Korean cargo ships, mainly fully laden, headed home yesterday after China told its trading companies to return coal from the isolated country, shipping data shows.Following repeated missile tests that drew international criticism, China banned all imports of North Korean coal on in February - cutting off the country's most important export product.China's customs department issued an official order on April 7 telling trading companies to return their North Korean coal cargoes, trading sources told Reuters.In February North Korean state media accused Beijing of “dancing to the tune of the US” and “styling itself as a big power” after China suspended coal imports from North Korea for the rest of the year.“Its recent measures are, in effect, tantamount to the enemies’ moves to bring down the social system,” the report said.
