  GETTYAustralia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Russia's President Vladimir Putin before the G20 summitDavid Cameron, Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin and Angela Merkel were some of the leaders kept in the dark about their privacy being breached.Visa details, passport numbers and other personal information of all leaders attending the summit in Australia in November were sent by the country’s immigration department to organisers of the Asian Cup football tournament, according to the Guardian.Also at the summit were Chinese president, Xi Jinping, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe and the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo.Immigration bosses were informed of the breach on November 7 last year. It was decided not to inform the victims, but this may be breaching some nations’ laws.In the UK, France and Germany it is law to inform victims of breaches.The bungling immigration worker, who has been kept anonymous, accidentally typed the wrong email address and sent the personal details to the organisers of the Asian Cup, which was hosted by Australia in January.  APVladimir Putin was one of 31 world leaders to have their details passed onThey only realised the mistake when the recipient replied saying they didn’t think the email was meant for them.In an email revealed under a freedom of information request, the Australian privacy commissioner said: “The personal information which has been breached is the name, date of birth, title, position nationality, passport number, visa grant number and visa subclass held relating to 31 international leaders (ie prime ministers, presidents and their equivalents) attending the G20 leaders summit.“The matter was brought to my attention directly by [redacted] immediately after receiving an email from [the recipient] informing them that they had sent the email to the wrong person.“The risk remains only to the extent of human error, but there was nothing systemic or institutional about the breach.”The officer wrote it was “unlikely” the information had been made public as the recipient had deleted the email and emptied their deleted items folder.She said she therefore didn’t “consider it necessary” to notify the clients of the breach.
