   Sino-US tensions over disputed territory in the South China Sea, along with sabre-rattling from North Korea which is mostly backed by China, have seen tensions in the region rise dramatically recently.The situation has also been enflamed by US President Donald Trump sending the aircraft carrier the Carl Vinson, along with an armada of warships to the region to undergo military drills in the area.Images of the Yulin naval base, located on Hainan Island of the hotly disputed islands off southern China close to Vietnam, now appear to show Beijing has stock-piled a range of land-base missile launchers that have the capability of reaching and knocking out the US military vessels.

    Israel-based ImageSat International snapped the images from its Eros B satellite with missiles being deployed on the base’s west side.Imagery analyst Amit Gur confirmed the new builds are anti-ship missiles.He said: "The direction in which the launchers are facing leads us to believes these are shore-to-ship missiles."Mr Gur added that the missiles pictured in the satellite looked to be fully operational and ready to fire.He added: "They must have concluded renovation work, as the systems are clearly visible."We don't just know if they are new systems, or a redeployment of the ones that were stored during the renovation."

    The missiles appear to have been installed on Monday after the base was essentially empty.While the US has said that the warships are there to put pressure North Korea who has threatened to attack the US with nuclear weapons, China is increasingly worried over the presence of the fleet so close to its own waters.Although China and the US have been enjoying improved relations lately after a visit to the US by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mr Trump referring to the premier as “his friend” both sides have remained cautious.
