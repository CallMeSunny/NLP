   US officials have suggested they may insert so-called “poison pill” clauses into future agreements, which could jeopardise deals with other countries including Britain.The clause means any country who signs a free trade deal with the United States could see it ripped up if they went on to sign a future deal with Beijing.Both the US and China have been quick to indicate their willingness to sign deals with the UK as soon as Brexit is completed, meaning the Government may be forced to choose a side.Yesterday, the Trump administration announced they were eager to sign a “cutting edge” trade deal the moment Britain leaves the EU.
