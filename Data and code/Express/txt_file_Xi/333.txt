  Peng Liyuan walks by the Union buildings during a working visit to South AfricaPeng Liyuan, the wife of new Chinese prime minister Xi Jinping, is fast becoming a global fashion icon, leading to comparisons with another leading lady, the Duchess of Cambridge.Like Kate, she has become an icon and her choice of outfits is mimicked by hundreds of millions of Chinese housewives.So popular has she become that the authorities have removed her name from some search engines in China to prevent fashion-hungry females crashing the internet.Like the former First Lady of France, model turned singer Carla Bruni, Ms Peng started out as a folk singer.Boosting the morale of People’s Liberation Army troops with propaganda classics like On The Plains Of Hope‚ she caused an internet storm when a picture emerged of her singing to troops after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.It was taken after the military crushed pro-democracy protests in Beijing, killing hundreds, possibly thousands, of people. Many in China are still unaware that the massacre happened.The picture was circulated mainly on Twitter, which is blocked in China.There were postings on popular Chinese microblogs, but they were swiftly taken down.Singer Peng Liyuan rehearses for the musical epic Road To Revival in 2009 Like Kate, she has become an icon and her choice of outfits is mimicked by hundreds of millions of Chinese housewives.For Ms Peng, the picture was no one-off. She has been in the military since the age of 18 and has fronted TV music videos, featuring dancing lines of men in combat fatigues.In an indication of her appeal, a man whose 19-year-old son was killed at Tiananmen said he bore no grudges against her.“If I had known about this then, I would have been very disgusted by it, but now, looking at it objectively, it’s all in the past,” said Wang Fandi, whose son Wang Nan was shot in the head.Wang taught at the China Conservatory of Music when Peng was sent there by the military to study singing. Though he never taught her, he knew her identity. He describes her as modest, a talented singer and an outstanding student.“Even if she had done something wrong, we shouldn’t make a fuss about it. What’s important is what happens in the future,” he said.Ms Peng married Jinping, a rising star of the Communist Party, in 1987 and the couple had a child five years later.The 50-year-old kept a low profile while her husband prepared to take over as Communist Party boss. Now her carefully coiffured appearances alongside him are intended to enhance the couple’s appeal abroad.Yet previous first ladies who have dared to be different have not fared well in China and in using her as a political prop, the government is in uncharted waters.The leadership wants Ms Peng to show the human side of Mr Xi, while not appearing elitist.It must balance support for the couple with a wariness of personality cults that could skew the consensus rule of the Communist Party leadership.Kelley Currie, a China human rights expert for the US pro-democracy Project 2049 Institute, said: “I think that we have a lot of people hoping that because Xi Jinping walks around without a tie on and his wife is a singer that maybe we’re dealing with a new kind of leader.“But I think these images remind people that this is the same party. It’s using some new tools and new techniques for the same purposes – to preserve its own power.”
