Heathrow VIPGuests are taken straight to their flight in a fleet of black BMWs (pictured)Its entrance is a plain white door on an unremarkable corridor – but behind is a well-appointed private area which costs £2,800 to hire for a single flight.Guests are driven directly to and from their flights in a fleet of black BMW limos, and can have their bags scanned and passports checked in private to keep them away from the eyes of the public.Outgoing passengers can also arrange for airport authorities to hold back their boarding until the last minute so they do not have to queue – or risk being seen boarding their flight.The suite has large windows made of bombproof glass, and has Italian leather armchairs, cashmere cushions and marble floors.Guests can choose from a luxury wine list, and have food prepared for them.

    But Whitehall sources tell Express.co.uk that using lounges is commonplace on long-haul trips so mandarins can work away from the inconveniences of travelling cattle class.Foreign Office officials defended the Royal Suite's cost, saying that it pays for itself because of the benefits it brings the UK.Officials cited £40billion of business deals brokered during the Chinese state visit as one perk, and isisted that use by UK personnel is kept to a minimum.They also said the lounge helped smooth over tense nuclear weapons negotiations with Iran last year.A spokesman said: "Airport lounges and the Royal Suite are mainly used by overseas Governments on official visits that benefit the UK. Use by the Foreign Secretary amounts to just three occasions in the last financial year, all were exceptional circumstances."There has been a reduction in cost of over £360,000 compared with 2010 and, since November 2012, a fixed fee is paid to Heathrow Airport for use of the Royal Suite, providing significant savings for the taxpayer."Related articles   SCANDAL: MPs get free VIP service at NHS hospital to protect them from members of public  REVEALED: The luxury new Airbnb properties YOU can rent for as little as £22 per night
