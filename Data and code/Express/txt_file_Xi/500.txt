      Bitcoin has grown quickly in its history (Image: CoinMarketCap)China has the strictest regulation and control over cryptocurrencies but the recent endorsement from the President highlights a shift in opinion. President Xi did not announce how he envisioned blockchain would be used in the Chinese economy of the future, but it appears the government has seen the uses in Blockchain tech. The comment came just a few days after the Chinese government’s central administrative branch mentioned blockchain in a top level missive. Should China begin to adopt blockchain technology into their economic infrastructure, the boost to bitcoin sales in the east may push BTC to a new high.Earlier this year, Fundstrat CEO Tom Lee claimed that bitcoin would soar past $25,000 by the end of 2018 and, should this new-found confidence in blockchain continue for China, it is easy to see this goal being achieved.
