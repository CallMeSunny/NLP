    var brightcoveBrandsafety='' Columnist Harry Cole lashed out at Jeremy Corbyn for snubbing the Queen’s invitation to a state banquet for US President Donald Trump. Mr Cole claimed the Labour leader is “not fulfilling his role”, adding that British voters will “have a field day”. The Mail on Sunday deputy political editor hit out at the Labour leader on BBC’s Any Questions?: “He invited the IRA to tea at the House of Commons two days after they tried to assassinate the Prime Minister and blow up the Cabinet. He calls Hezbollah his friends, he spins for Iranian state television for the sum of £20,000. He has invited to dinner every passing communist and dodgy cleric for the last 30 years.
