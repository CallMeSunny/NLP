Other types of bombs can be more effective against deeper, hardened tunnels.It was the first time the United States has used this size of conventional bomb in a conflict.Trump described the bombing as a "very successful mission." It was not immediately clear how much damage the device did.8.45pm BST: President Donald Trump touted the bombing as evidence of a more muscular U.S. foreign policy since he took office in January after eight years of President Barack Obama."If you look at what's happened over the last eight weeks and compare that really to what's happened over the last eight years, you'll see that there's a tremendous difference," Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday.6.45pm BST: The US military just demonstrated its destructive power by dropping a MOAB bomb in Nangarhar, Afghanistan.The Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb is an impressive explosive capable of levelling land around it. The bomb is one of the most powerful weapons possessed by the US army, bar none but the atomic bomb.General John W. Nicholson of the US Central Command said in a statement: “As ISIS-K's losses have mounted, they are using IEDs, bunkers and tunnels to thicken their defense.”He added: “This is the right munition to reduce these obstacles and maintain the momentum of our offensive against ISIS-K.This bomb was used against ISIS targets in Afghanistan but serves as a reminder of America’s tremendous military power.4.45pm BTS: Despite the growing tension in the region, the North Korean regime is preparing for the nation's most important holiday – the 105th anniversary of the birth of founder Kim Il-sung.More than 100,000 people were spotted in the centre of Pyongyang today, in the run-up to the national holiday on Saturday.A large scale military parade is expected to march down the streets of the capital on the day.3pm BST: Donald Trump has said that Nato is “no longer obsolete”, reversing his previous position on the military alliance.The US President hosted Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the White House on April 12 for a “productive discussion about what more Nato can do in the fight against terrorism”.If Kim Jong-un were to attack the US, any retaliation would be backed by the 27 other Nato states under Article V of the North American Treaty.Mr Trump also tweeted today: "I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea.

AFP GettyNational meeting at the People's Palace of Culture in Pyongyang    7am BST: Former Russian military general Evgeny Buzhinsky told BBC Four's Today programme: “When we had the Cold War everything was much clearer and less dangerous - there were definite red lines, there were definite truths.“Now, after 20 years of the so-called friendship between the Russia and West, the situation is much worse, no truths or no red lines.” 6am BST: Stocks in Hong Kong and China fell this morning as investors' appetite for risky assets soured on concerns over political tensions in North Korea and the Middle East.Energy stocks were among the biggest decliners, underpinned by losses in coal miners, after a trading source said China's customs department ordered traders to return North Korean coal.5am BST: South Korean acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn warned of "greater provocations" by North Korea and ordered the military to intensify monitoring and to ensure close communication with the United States."It is possible the North may wage greater provocations such as a nuclear test timed with various anniversaries including the Supreme People's Assembly," said Hwang. Hwang has been acting leader since former President Park Geun-hye was removed amid a graft scandal.Monday April 10 Pyongyang has slammed ‘reckless moves’ by the US and pledged to defend the North Korea from invasion ‘by powerful force of arms’, according to state media. A Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying: “We will hold the US wholly accountable for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by its outrageous actions.”But China and South Korea have agreed to slap tougher sanctions on North Korea if the country carries out nuclear or long-range missile tests, according to an official in Seoul. Former MI6 head Sir John Sawers has warned that tensions with North Korea are actually a much bigger threat to world peace than the war in Syria. “If you are looking for a world crisis which could bring about the dangers of a clash between great powers then North Korea is a bigger concern than Syria,” he told BBC Four’s Today programme.At the weekend, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Donald Trump and Xi Jinping had “extensive discussions around the dangerous situation in North Korea” at a summit at in Florida last week. “President Xi clearly understands, and I think agrees, that the situation has intensified and has reached a certain level of threat that action has to be taken,” he told CBS’s Face the Nation.
