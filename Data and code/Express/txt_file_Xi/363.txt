   The visit, confirmed by North Korean and Chinese state media, will likely lead to Chairman Kim’s fourth summit with President Xi in the past year and comes amid plans for a second summit with US President Donald Trump aimed at denuclearising the Korean peninsula.Chairman Kim held three summits last year with President Xi, his most important ally, before and after summits with President Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.Harry J. Kazianis, the Director of Defence Studies at US-based Centre for the National Interest said: "Kim is eager to remind the Trump administration that he does have diplomatic and economic options besides what Washington and Seoul can offer,""In fact, during his New Year's Day speech, Kim’s ‘new way’ that he referred to may well have been a veiled threat to move closer to Beijing. That should make America quite concerned."

A motorcade with heavy security later drove through central Beijing.The visit coincided with what South Korean officials say is Chairman Kim's 35th birthday on Tuesday.Chairman Kim’s visit to North Korea's most important economic and diplomatic ally, which was first reported by South Korean media, follows reports of advanced negotiations for a second summit between Washington and Pyongyang aimed at resolving the standoff over North Korea's nuclear programme.

But he warned that he may seek an alternative path if US sanctions and pressure against the country continued.In an interview with CNBC on Monday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised China's support for resolving the North Korean crisis and said he did not think the US trade dispute with China would affect this.Chairman Kim’s visit comes as a US delegation opened a second day of talks with Chinese counterparts in Beijing aimed at ending the trade war between the world's two largest economies."The Chinese have been very clear to us that these are separate issues,” Secretary Pompeo said."Their behaviour has demonstrated that as well and we appreciate that. China has actually been a good partner in our efforts to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea's nuclear capability; I expect they will continue to do so."
