   The Ministry of Defence warned of the improved military capabilities of the Kim regime ahead of the publication of a defence report on North Korea and the threat it poses.A series of nuclear and missile tests carried out by North Korea later last year triggered the UK Government to examine its response abilities to the threats of an attack.But despite reduced tension between the North Korean regime and the international community, Defence minister Earl Howe revealed North Korea could be on the verge of developing missiles capable of reaching the United Kingdom.He said: "Our judgement is that it’s probably six to 18 months before they will have an ICBM capability capable of reaching the coast of the United States or indeed ourselves."  GETTY•PARLIAMENT TVNorth Korea news: Earl Howe said North Korea could have missiles ready to hit UK in six monthsWhile he reassured the MoD did not find evidence indicating North Korea would strike the UK he suggested the risks justified maintaining Britain's nuclear deterrent to further defend the country.He continued: "I think whenever we debate the issue of the UK deterrent, the North Korean weapons programme is cited as a prime example of why we can never be complacent."Following the successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the US last September, former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon warned the UK could become an easier target due to its closeness compared to US cities.But recent openings from leader Kim Jong-un suggest North Korea could be on the verge of settling for a diplomatic resolution to years of tension with the United States and its allies in the region.   The leader of the rogue nation has agreed to meet with US President Donald Trump and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in sometime in May this year.President Trump declared that he had received word the leader of the hermit kingdom was looking forward to their meeting.He tweeted: “Received message last night from Xi Jinping of China that his meeting with Kim Jong-un went very well and that Kim looks forward to his meeting with me. In the meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost!”Before the joint meeting with the US, South Korea and North Korea agreed to hold a summit which will be their first in more than 10 years on April 27.The summit will take place at the border truce village of Panmunjom.
