    var brightcoveBrandsafety='4 Sport and specialist news &ndash; passed for ad targeting' President Xi Jinping is overseeing a sweeping plan to refurbish the People's Liberation Army (PLA) by developing everything from stealth jets to aircraft carriers as China ramps up its presence in the South China Sea and around self-ruled Taiwan. The navy has been a key beneficiary of the modernisation plan as China looks to project power far from the country's shores and protect its trading routes and citizens overseas. Last month, Beijing unveiled a target of 7.5 percent rise in defence spending for this year, a slower rate than last year but still outpacing China's economic growth target. Deputy naval commander Qiu Yanpeng said the parade off the eastern city of Qingdao will feature 32 vessels and 39 aircraft.
