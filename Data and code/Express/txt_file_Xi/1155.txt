   Wolfgang Schäuble, 74, a veteran politician in Germany and part of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cabinet since she took office in 2005, made rather blunt comments over his concern Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ policy was weakening the liberal, Western world.The US President’s policy of putting the country’s self-interest first and so, effectively, withdrawing from the world stage on issues such as trade, climate change and global security weakened the West’s position in a number of areas.Mr Schäuble, speaking at the think tank, American Academy, in Berlin, said: “I doubt whether the United States truly believes that the world order would be equally sound if China or Russia were to fill the gaps left by the US, and if China and Russia were simply given a free hand to dominate the spheres of influence that they have defined for themselves.
