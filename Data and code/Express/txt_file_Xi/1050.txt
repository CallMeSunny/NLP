    var brightcoveBrandsafety='' Almost 40 world leaders are in Beijing for the second summit in three years to discuss China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The programme, aimed at stimulating global economic growth through the creation of an international corridor of land and naval trading routes, could cost a mind-boggling $1 trillion (£774.9 billion). The BRI is forecast to account for one third of the world’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the future, according to the EU-owned European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
