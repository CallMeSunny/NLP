      GETTY Trump urged the international community to stem the threat of North Korea Mr Trump’s demands for China and Russia to work with the US come despite the Kremlin admitting Washington and Moscow do not co-operate on the deepening North Korea tensions. The world is on the brink of World War 3 as North Korea continues to flex its military muscle with a stream of nuclear tests in direct threat to the US. The US leader has previously said dialogue with President Vladimir Putin is vital to solving global issues, such as the Syrian War and threats by North Korea.The two superpowers met for the first time during the G20 Summit earlier this year, where the pair are said to have shared "positive chemistry".  REUTERS Trump and Putin first met at a G20 summit The meeting, scheduled for 35 minutes, took more than 2 hours and focused heavily on a just-announced cease fire deal for south west Syria and the growing threat from the North.Relations between Moscow and Washington have soured further since, however.President Trump in August grudgingly signed off on new sanctions against Russia, a move Moscow said ended hopes for better ties. Mr Putin, dismayed by the sanctions, ordered Washington to more than halve its embassy and consular staff in Russia.
