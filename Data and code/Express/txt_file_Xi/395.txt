    The aim of the PLA is to become a top-ranked military force by 2050, and in January it published the revised official military training outline as part of its efforts to achieve the aspired goal.A report from the official press agency of the People's Republic of China said the officers present at the exercise had “experienced a simulated future war, war-zone scenarios, and lived a combat-ready routine”.It added: “The focus is on centralising teaching, encouraging reflection and review and to discuss and exchange thoughts.”   The reason behind Chinese authorities vowing to improve their military forces comes after becoming increasingly worried over the activities of East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), an extremist group, against Chinese targets.China has labelled the group as a terrorist organisation and blames the ETIM for the violence in the city of Xinjiang.In 2017, a knife attack coincided with the growing threat of ISIS in the region, sparking fears the organisation could have its sights set on attacking China through its western province.
