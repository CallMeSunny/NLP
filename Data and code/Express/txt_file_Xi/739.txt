GETTYNorth Korea news: China is wary that Donald Trump could cut them out of a deal with Kim Jong-un“I think the Chinese are always suspect and sceptical about direct talks between the United States and North Korea because they are a little bit wary or concerned that the United States may try and cut them out of any deal that involves the security of the Korean peninsula and long-term unification of the two Koreas.“So the Chinese are on the one hand supportive but on the other hand they will want to be involved in any long-term discussions in the future.”Chinese state media said President Trump and President Xi talked by phone earlier today, just hours after it was revealed Kim Jong-un will meet Mr Trump face-to-face.The state-run news agency said Mr Xi told Mr Trump he hopes all sides can show goodwill and avoid doing anything that may affect or interfere with the improving situation on the Korean peninsula.

    Experts are sceptical that Kim Jong-un is truly willing to give up his nuclear weapons after the country has spent 40 years developing them.North Korea made several promises to disarm in the past and has backtracked every time, leaving experts doubtful over whether it will also break the new commitments.President Trump has previously branded Kim Jong-un as “little rocket man” and threatened “fire and fury” and to “totally destroy” North Korea if the country ever attacked the US or one of its allies, sparking World War 3 fears.
