  David Cameron's influence on the global stage is waning [PA]The Prime Minister has dropped out of the top 10 on Forbes Magazine's list, slipping one place to 11th behind Wal-Mart chief executive Michael Duke.US President Barack Obama is ousted from the number one spot by his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.In its profile of Mr Cameron, the magazine said he had been damaged by the row over energy prices and now had only "two years to galvanise the Tory party ahead of a 2015 General Election".The prestigious publication added: "The Conservative PM guides the world's sixth largest economy and was once hailed as the second coming of Margaret Thatcher. No more.Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama are topping the most influential list [PA]"He has recently been criticised for a flip-flop approach to green taxes after he pledged to slash the tax on household energy bills amid soaring gas and electricity prices."The Oxford graduate and (illegitimate) descendent of King William IV (1830-1837) has fired at the Guardian newspapers and NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden for 'making it a lot more difficult to keep our countries and our citizens safe'."Chinese premier Xi Jinping is at number three in the Forbes list, Pope Francis is at number four and German chancell Angela Merkel is the top-placed woman at number five.The magazine ranks the 72 people on the list - one for every 100 million people on Earth - according to how many people they have power over, the financial resources they control, if they have influence in more than one sphere, and how actively they wield their power to change the world.1 Vladimir Putin: (left) President, Russia2 Barack Obama: President, United States3 Xi Jinping: General Secretary, Communist Party, China4 Pope Francis: Pope, Roman Catholic Church5 Angela Merkel: (right) Chancellor, Germany6 Bill Gates: Co-Chair, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation7 Ben Bernanke: Chairman, Federal Reserve, United States8 Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud: King, Saudi Arabia9 Mario Draghi: President, European Central Bank10 Michael Duke: CEO, Wal-Mart Stores
