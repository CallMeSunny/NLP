  Christian persecution: Research by OpenDoors has listed the worst places to be Christian (Image: OPENDOORS/GETTY IMAGES)North Korea, Afghanistan and Pakistan remain in the top five places where it is hardest to be a Christian, according to new research by Christian charity OpenDoors. But the rise in attacks by Hindu extremists in India and tough new laws in China have seen believers in world’s two most populous countries face “extreme” and “very high” levels of persecution respectively. The study concluded that some 245 million Christians experience high levels of persecution in 73 countries around the world - up from 215 million in 58 countries last year.

Indian states have imposed new 'anti-blasphemy' laws which have been used to justify attacks (Image: GETTY IMAGES)The OpenDoors study ranked India as the 10th most difficult place to practice Christianity in 2019, with Christians facing “horrific levels of violence from extremists”.Research by the charity found thousands of attacks take place each year with the ruling Hindu nationalist party promoting “anti-conversion” laws.The laws have been adopted by eight of India’s 29 states and are frequently cited as justification for attacks on Christians.Under the continued premiership of Xi Jinping, China has risen 16 places on OpenDoors’ World Watch List to 27.The country’s 100 million Christians suffer a “high” level of persecution, the charity said, as Beijing tightens its grip on religious freedom in the world’s most populous country.New rules introduced by the Chinese government are “the most restrictive in 13 years”, according to OpenDoors, with strict legal limits on religious expression which can lead to harsh punishments if breached.
