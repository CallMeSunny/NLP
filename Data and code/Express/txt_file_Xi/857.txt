  GETTYMrs May is putting the EDF project on the back burner over security fearsNow sources say it's her deep rooted fears over security that could lead to the entire project being scrapped.The project was granted approval by the UK in January 2008 when Gordon Brown was the Prime Minister and his brother Andrew was employed as a director of corporate communications for French energy company EDF.EDF, which is 85 per cent owned by the French government, purchased British Energy for £12.4 billion in a deal that was finalised in February 2009. Mr Brown and his government gave the go-ahead for a new generation of nuclear power stations to be built earmarking Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C as future building projects.Together the energy stations were forecast to contribute 13 per cent of UK electricity by the early 2020s.
