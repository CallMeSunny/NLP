   North Korea can be stopped but secondary sanctions are needed against its neighbour China to stop the country breaking UN sanctions, former Special Forces officer Lt. Col. Michael Waltz has warned.Speaking to Fox News, he said: “One, I’m glad he called him out on the behaviour, it needs to be done.“But two, I think really the next step is additional what we call secondary sanctions which are sanctions not against the North Koreans but against the Chinese entities, the banks, the oil and gas, the food stuff, the shipping industry that are continuing to do business behind the scenes with North Korea.”US officials released images which claim to show Chinese tankers transferring fuel to North Korean ships 30 times in just three months despite UN sanctions preventing countries from trading with Kim Jong-un’s regime.

The country’s nuclear program will not be stopped by economic sanctions, an expert has warned.Dr Andy Jackson, a Monash University professor, said the sanctions imposed by the UN are not impacting North Korea as hoped. Dr Jackson said: “They don’t seem to be impacting the areas that Washington wants them to impact – the elites and the military. If anything these oil supplies that get through to the north are going to be diverted to the military.“There’s a significant amount of research going into economic sanctions which suggest that actually as more official trade is blocked by economic sanctions, the amount of cross-border unofficial trade actually increases.”
