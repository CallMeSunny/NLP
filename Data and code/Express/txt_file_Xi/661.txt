    This could pave the way for re-energising military options, turning an opportunity into catastrophe.Report by Carla Freeman and Mel GurtovCarla Freeman, director of the Foreign Policy Institute think tank, and Mel Gurtov, a Professor at Portland State University, said the proposed summit presented an “extraordinary opportunity” for a breakthrough which could potentially make the world a safer place, the opposite could also end up being the case.But the academics warned if talks collapse the summit could turn into a catastrophe. The report states: “In testing Kim’s seriousness, and demonstrating his own, Trump will have to be willing to entertain proposals for less than immediate outcomes. “If his summit with North Korea collapses amid disappointed expectations, this could pave the way for re-energising military options, turning an opportunity into catastrophe.” Related articles   USA prepares for Trump's North Korea summit with Kim Jong-un   Syria strike threatens US peace talks with 'frightened' North Korea    GETTYUS President Donald Trump has admitted the summit may not actually happenThey also warned that the initiative also had the potential to disrupt relations between the USA and its ally, the Republic of Korea, in the south of the peninsula.Writing for North Korea watchdog 38 North, the report said: “To be sure, there is no guarantee that engagement will produce mutual gains that set the Korean Peninsula on a positive new course. “It may be that these talks also fail and we assess that the best we can do is try to keep a channel of communication open as the US maintains regional deterrence capabilities. “On the other hand, with North Korea, the US has never truly attempted the kind of peace-building that an engagement strategy requires.”  GETTYKim's meeting with Xi Jinping, featured on the front page of this Chinese newspaperMr Trump surprised the world when he confirmed that he was willing to meet with Kim, whom he had poured scorn on in various tweets since he was elected in 2016, including one in which he called the much-ridiculed supreme leader “short and fat”.The subject of “denuclearisation”, whereby North Korea would be encouraged to give up its nuclear weapons, is rumoured to be on the proposed agenda.But since then his announcement, Mr Trump has replaced Rex Tillerson with the hawkish John Bolton as Secretary of State, and HR McMaster with Mike Pompeo as National Security Adviser, prompting concerns about whether the talks could be derailed before they had even begun.

    Meanwhile, Kim has paid a visit to Chinese leader Xi Jinping at which the proposed meeting will undoubtedly have been discussed.No details have been offered so far about where or when the meeting will take place.However, Frank Jannuzi, a former adviser to John Kerry during his time as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an authority in North Korean affairs, told Express.co.uk last month it could be as early as next month May.Mr Jannuzi added: “I think it will probably be in the Joint Security Area at Panmunjom in the demilitarised zone.”
