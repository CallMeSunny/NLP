   Mr Putin offered to host the next summit after his US counterpart Donald Trump suggested Russia should have been at the Quebec gathering which came to an acrimonious end last night.Russia was booted out of the then-G8 when it annexed Ukraine's Crimea four years ago and has done little since to win favour with the elite group of wealthy nations.Mr Putin, speaking during a visit to China, said: "We did not choose to leave it, our colleagues refused to come to Russia due to known reasons at some point.“Please, we will be glad to see everyone here in Moscow.”He then pointed out the combined purchasing power of the Russia and China-led Shanghai Co-operation Organisation outstripped the G7 which currently includes Britain, the US, Canada, Japan, Italy, France and Germany.

I think it would be good for Russia. I think it would be good for the United States.“I think it would be good for all of the countries of the current G7.”Italy's new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conti expressed similar sentiment.
