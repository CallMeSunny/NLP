   President Trump dropped the biggest hint yet over how he will respond to the EU’s targeted tariffs on bourbon whiskey and Harley Davidson motorcycles by threatening to hit all imports of cars assembled in the EU with a 20 percent tariff.Mr Trump took the fight to Twitter and said: “Based on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the U.S. & its great companies and workers by the European Union, if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20 percent Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!French finance minister Mr Le Maire - a key ally to French President Macron - said: “If the United States hits us again with a 20 percent increase on cars we will respond again. We don’t want an escalation, but we are the ones being attacked.“Whatever allows jobs to be created in Europe goes in the right direction. We don’t want a trade war, but we will defend ourselves.” Related articles   Donald Trump BLASTS Harley-Davidson for waving 'WHITE FLAG'    TRADE WAR: German confidence CRASHES   France has warned the US over tariff retaliation (Image: GETTY) If the United States hits us again with a 20 percent increase on cars we will respond again. We don’t want an escalation, but we are the ones being attacked.Bruno Le MaireMoody’s has told its clients that “tariffs on imported cars, parts would be broadly credit negative for industry”.The note said: “A 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles and parts would be negative for nearly every segment of the auto industry — carmakers, parts suppliers, car dealers, and transportation companies.“Should any tariffs be levied, carmakers would need to absorb the cost to protect sales volumes while hurting profitability; increase prices to pass the tariff costs to customers, which could hurt sales; or a combination of both.”The EU is also deeply unhappy over US plans to sanction companies for doing business with Iran following President Trump’s decision to pull out of a 2015 international nuclear deal.Mr Le Maire said he had so far not received “positive signs” from Washington about joint French, German and British requests for exemptions from the sanctions.He said: “For the moment, our requests remain unanswered.”China and the EU have vowed to go blow-for-blow with the US, saying unilateral actions risked pushing the world into a recession.President Xi Jinping’s top economic adviser Vice Premier Liu He said that China and the EU had agreed to defend the multilateral trading system. He said: "Unilateralism is on the rise and trade tensions have appeared in major economies.“China and the EU firmly oppose trade unilateralism and protectionism and think these actions may bring recession and turbulence to the global economy.”  Bruno Le Maire, finance minister (Image: GETTY)
