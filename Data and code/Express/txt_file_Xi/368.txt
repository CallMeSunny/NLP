    var brightcoveBrandsafety='' The powerful military could destroy American aircraft carriers if the rivalry between China and Trump turns into a war. Many of these missiles are specifically designed to attack the aircraft carriers and bases that form the backbone of the US military. China’s missiles outperform their counterparts in the armouries of the United States and its allies, according to current and former US military officers.
