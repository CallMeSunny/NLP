  GETTYNorth Korea news: Kim Jong-un threatens to blast Guam with missilesChina has claimed Mr Trump needs to back down with Beijing based president Xi Jinping, and Germany’s Angela Merkel ordering the US president to end his verbal war with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.Threat and counter threat are bounding backwards and forwards overseas while North Korean missiles launched so far have landed off the coast of Japan.Pyongyang threatened to hit the US treaty of Guam, where the US keeps a US air base, a Navy installation, a Coast Guard group and roughly 6,000 US military personnel.The North said it could launch Hwasong-12 missiles 2,000 miles from North Korea, prompting Guam authorities to issue emergency guidelines for how to respond to an attack. So what will happen if North Korea launches a missile towards US territory? Upon missile launch detection Washington would deploy its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD.The controversial interception technology is stationed in South Korea where experts say it could destroy ballistic missiles inside - or out - of the earth’s atmosphere.Sheer brute impact is enough to destroy warheads at the point of collision, those behind THAAD say.Despite the massive kinetic energy built up to ram the missile, the nuke would not be set off, it is claimed.
