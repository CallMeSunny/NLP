   These sanctions from China actually went further than UN sanction rules set out. This is a surprising move compared to China’s history of being reluctant to impose any form of sanctions on North Korea.The UN stipulates a 89 percent cut for sanctions, this number has been exceeded by China. In 2016 Xi Jinping told Barack Obama that North Korea had little to loose from sanctions as the country was already experiencing poverty.In response to this news Alex Wolf, economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments and a former US diplomat in China said: “China has effectively turned off the petroleum taps flowing into North Korea.

    “From the data available . . . it appears that the North Korean economy is under a great deal of pressure and this has undoubtedly contributed to North Korea’s change in policy.“It is Chinese ‘maximum pressure’ that may be bringing a change in North Korean policy.”In an odd move by the rogue state following countless missile tests, North Korea has been attempting to arrange diplomatic ties with countries that have shown opposition towards them.Kim Jong-Un has invited Donald Trump to a summit, this offer has been accepted and his sister Kim Yo Jung attending the winter olympics held in South Korea in February.

Irregardless of these opinions the Chinese embargo definitely impacted North Korea. Official Chinese statistics show that the monthly average of refined petroleum exports to North Korea in January and February was 175.2 tons, just 1.3 percent of the monthly average of 13,552.6 tons shipped in the first half of 2017.Chinese coal exports to North Korea were also cut to zero in the three months to the end of February, after exporting an average of 8,627 tons in the first half of 2017.Export of steel also dropped dramatically from an average of 15,110 tons in the first half of 2017 to 257 tons in the first two months of this year.Motor vehicles to North Korea also took a hit with only one unit being exported to the country in February.   There have been concerns previously over the accuracy of China’s statistics are common but analysts have said that large drops in export volumes are unlikely to be false.A senior Chinese official said that Beijing wanted to bring Pyongyang to the negotiating table.The official went on to explain that it is important that the US and other countries realise that North Korea’s objective is not aggression but to win security guarantees.The Chinese official added that North Korea has shown willingness in the past to negotiate but it was the US and its inflexibility that halted the process.Mr Wolf said: “China wants to play a central role in resolving this crisis, but it wants to do it on its own terms.”
