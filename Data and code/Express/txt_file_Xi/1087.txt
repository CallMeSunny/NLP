And there were no nuclear tests to mark the holiday, as has happened in each of the last two years.North Korea routinely uses major holidays to showcase its military capabilities and the latest developments in missile technology.But that has lessened this year, underlining Kim's stated aim for denuclearising the Korean peninsula and his recent meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and summits with Trump in Singapore and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing and Dalian.The theme for the celebrations this year was economic development and unifying the Korean peninsula, divided since World War Two.
