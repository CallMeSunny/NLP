  GETTY - STOCK IMAGEBookshelves have made a comebackThat’s right, those wooden/MDF shelves, currently housing your collection of text books purloined from school, poetry volumes bestowed upon you by a former infatuated swain, recipe tomes you’ve never used, something sexy you borrowed from a colleague and never returned, a couple of worthy hardbacks you splashed out on but were never worth the money, two chunky works on Rembrandt and a swathe of battered chick-lits spattered with sun screen, are on the crest of a revival.Perhaps you had no idea bookcases were under threat of extinction?Maybe you thought shelves to encase the literary forays and flirtations of your lifetime were essential, as necessary to hearth and home as a flushing loo and a fridge?If you’d never even paused to consider whether bookcases had a future or were destined for the junk shop and car boot sale it’s OK, don’t worry, the crisis is averted, panic over and those of us who were proud to be awarded the Book Lovers badge at Brownies can snuggle down with the new Anne Tyler and relax.Apparently those whose business it is to worry about these matters went through a major bookcase wobble way back in 2015.At that time it looked as if our brief fiery passion for the Kindle had put the shelf/ book combo under severe threat.Sales of bookcases plummeted, retailers had written them off as unsaleable and it seemed that our chance to judge strangers instantly by having a swift but canny perusal of the titles on display would be thwarted for ever.

Prepare to see the fellow in your life attired in pink shoes.West Ham striker Andy Carroll put his best foot forward at a premiere in a pair of baby pink suede Chelsea boots and there’s every reason to expect the craze to sweep through to your own dear lads.I would attempt to issue a veto at Feltz Towers if my fashion-forward Other Half hadn’t been stepping out in the dratted things for the past two months.-----------------------   Christine Lampard, formerly Bleakley, is a pleasure to hang around with. She started on the other side of the camera, working on the production side of TV in Northern Ireland, so she experienced the ghastly side of dealing with celebrities with puffed-up egos and doesn’t have an ounce of the diva in her personality. Nonetheless, as a recognisable telly face, she finds herself fielding unbearably insensitive questions from members of the public, top of the list of which is: “When are you going to have a baby?” Christine is 38 and has been married to footballer Frank for two years. These probing questions can’t be comfortable to deal with. She shows commendable honesty and self-control when she says the process of IVF has been so harrowing for friends she can’t imagine electing to go through it herself. “My attitude is that I will wait and see what happens.” A less well brought-up person might choose to respond: “None of your beeping business!”----------------------- Jodie Whittaker: The first female Doctor Who in pictures Thu, November 9, 2017Jodie Whittaker: The first female Doctor Who in pictures.

    No reason Doc can’t be a herQuestion: what’s the feminine of doctor?Answer: Doctor!We are so over being shocked at the notion of a female doctor/pilot/prime minister that the only surprising occurrence following the BBC’s announcement that the new star of Doctor Who will be played by Jodie Whittaker was an outbreak of “outrage” among tweeters.There’s no reason on earth for the Doctor to be a chap.The character routinely regenerates and emerging for the 13th time as what David Walliams would call a “laydee” feels like a shot in the arm for the show and an inspired way to attract new fans.-----------------------  GETTY - STOCK IMAGEIn the best cases the arrangement of having an au pair worked like a dreamAu pair daysRemember au pairs?They were the stuff of saucy fantasy, gorgeous girls usually from Europe who would arrive in middle-class households and take on housework and babysitting in exchange for board and lodging, pocket money and the chance to learn English.Host families were expected to treat them as they would a daughter, not boss them about as if they were staff.In the best cases the arrangement worked like a dream.Ironing was done. Friendships were formed and horizons broadened.In the worst cases the au pair scarpered with the husband, pinched the family jewels or left the children watching unsuitable films while she cavorted with the builder, or the family demanded haute cuisine from a clueless teenager incapable of boiling an egg.The number of young women applying to become au pairs in the UK is falling.Post-Brexit it is being suggested we’re now perceived as “anti-foreigner”.I remember ours with varying degrees of fondness as an infinite source of gossip for my mother and her chums in the 1960s and 1970s.Most of ours departed sobbing, clasping my mother in a tear-stained embrace and many are still in touch to this day.Love always to Gertrude (Germany, 1964), Heidi (Switzerland, 1966), Ghodsi (Iran, 1970) and all those characters who pitched in to our lives with such gusto.-----------------------  GETTYWinnie The Pooh is being censored on Chinese social mediaPooh censoredSomething is up in the Hundred Acre Wood.Winnie-the-Pooh is “bear non grata” on Chinese social media.Tweeters who mention Christopher Robin, Eeyore, Rabbit, Owl, Piglet, Kanga, Roo and Winnie find their messages deleted and replaced with the warning “this content is illegal”.Could this have anything to do with the fact that President Xi Jinping has been compared with A A Milne’s ursine creation?I couldn’t possibly comment.
