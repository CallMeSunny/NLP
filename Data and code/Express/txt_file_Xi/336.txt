China wants to punish North Korea."China once had special relations with the Soviet Union but they had war with that country."They also had a very special relationship with Vietnam but then they had a war with them in 1979"The relationship between China and North Korea is worse than both of those."I will say, there are no permanent friends and no permanent enemies."

No country has ever encountered such tough sanctions before."If they do nothing, they will starve to death. If they do another ICBM test, they will seek to die."North Korea is standing on the edge of a deep cliff, one light blow could push this country of the cliff."When asked whether this meant one more missile test could trigger war, the professor agreed. This week the China's leader Xi Jinping outlined his plans to make China the most powerful nation in the world.In a three and a half hour speech at the Chinese Communist Party Congress, he said he would build the biggest army in the world, but wanted to avoid a conflict with US President Donald Trump over North Korea.But, speaking of the People's Liberation Army, he said: “A military is built to fight.”    He told delegates: “By 2050 China will become a global leader in terms of comprehensive national strength and international influence with the rule of law, innovative companies, a clean environment, an expanding middle class, adequate public transportation and reduced disparities between urban and rural areas.“Chinese people will enjoy greater happiness and well-being, and the Chinese nation will stand taller and firmer in the world.“China is approaching the centre of the world stage.”A cyber security expert told Express.co.uk China could strike the US by pretending to be North Korea.Matt Morris, vice president of NexDefense, said hackers knew the digital footprints of other states and were mimicking them to use as a decoy.CIA chief Mike Pompeo said on Thursday that North Korea could be only “months” away from gaining the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons.US President Donald Trump is expected to try and pressure the Chinese president when they meet next month. The White House want China to do more to rein in North Korea, following the president's consolidation of power at the Communist Party Congress.
