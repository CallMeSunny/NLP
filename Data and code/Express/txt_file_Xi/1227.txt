  The trade war has is having an impact on global markets (Image: GETTY)Germany, Japan, South Korea, the US and China are among those who will be hit hardest next year, according to the Moody’s report.Global economic growth will slow in 2019 and 2020 to just under 2.9 percent, down from an estimated 3.3 percent in 2018 and 2019, Moody’s said.And the analysis has also suggested there is no end in sight to the disagreement, which could continue “for some time” – a concern previously expressed by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, who on Tuesday reiterated his concerns about the “stupid” dispute.The two superpowers have been at loggerheads ever since US President Donald Trump slapped punishing new tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent respectively on Chinese steel and aluminium imports, triggering Beijing to respond with levies of its own on American exports.

However, the plan has now been shelved, with Mr Ma saying in September: "This promise was on the basis of friendly China-US cooperation and reasonable bilateral trade relations, but the current situation has already destroyed that basis."This promise can't be completed."Research by UBS has revealed a 30 percent drop in imports of products listed as being subject to a package of tariffs imposed by the US Government on July 6.It was too early to judge the impact of a further round of tariffs totally $200 million which were imposed on September 24.However, China reported much stronger-than-expected exports for October as shippers rushed goods to the United States, its biggest trading partner, racing to beat higher tariff rates which are due to kick in at the start of next year.
