That has rattled Beijing's neighbours, several of whom are engaged in territorial disputes with China, as well as Washington.China says it has no hostile intent and that it needs a modern military to protect its legitimate security needs as the world's second-largest economy.But the communist state has sparked a fierce dispute over claims to atolls - both man made and natural - in the South China Sea.
