China has the good faith, on the basis of mutual respect and equality, to resolve the bilateral trade frictions," Lu said.President Trump imposed import tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods last year and has threatened more to pressure Beijing to change its practices on issues ranging from industrial subsidies to intellectual property to hacking. China has retaliated with tariffs of its own."As for whether the Chinese economy is good or not, I have already explained this. China's development has ample tenacity and huge potential," Mr Lu said. "We have firm confidence in the strong long-term fundamentals of the Chinese economy."

I think the two sides need some kind of agreement for now," Tu said.Data last week showed manufacturing has slowed in both China and the United States, though the US Labour Department on Friday reported a surge in new jobs in December along with higher wages.Officials have given scant details on concessions that China might be willing to make to meet US demands, some of which would require structural reforms unpalatable for Chinese leaders.Even if a trade agreement is reached soon, analysts say it would be no panacea for China's economy, which is expected to continue decelerating in coming months.China's stridently nationalist Global Times tabloid said in an editorial late on Sunday that statements from both sides that they hoped to reach a deal were cause for optimism, but that Beijing would not cave in to US demands."If China was going to raise the white flag, it would have done it already," the paper said.
