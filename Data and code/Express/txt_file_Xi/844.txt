    But tempers flared again after the latest launch with US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley warning China should cut off oil to the rogue neighbour.Ms Haley said in a speech to the UN Mr Trump had called Chinese President Xi Jinping to demand an end to the supply of oil.She added: "We now turn to President Xi to also take that stand. We believe he has an opportunity to do the right thing for the benefit of all countries. “China must show leadership and follow through. China can do this on its own, or we can take the oil situation into our own hands.”Mr Trump has been riled by the latest tests, which came following months of inaction from the hermit state.  GETTYDonald Trump called the North Korea leader 'Little Rocket Man'North Korean state media said on Twitter the Hwasong-15 ICBM was a historic step towards “completing the state’s nuclear force”.Pyongyang boasted its most powerful missile to date was capable of striking anywhere on the US mainland.A South Korean army official said it was an “unidentified ballistic missile” from Pyongsong aiming east.    In response to the launch, Mr Trump initially said: “It is a situation we will handle. We will take care of it.”US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters: “It went higher frankly than any previous shot they've taken, a research and development effort on their part to continue building ballistic missiles that can threaten everywhere in the world, basically.”Russia have criticised the US for its tactics against Kim’s state.Kremlin foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said the Russian state condemned the latest launch but accused Washington of being provocative."We were encouraged by that approach. And then suddenly ... they announced large-scale exercises in December. We have the impression that it was all done specially to get Kim Jong Un to ‘fly off the handle’ and take another reckless step."More to follow...
