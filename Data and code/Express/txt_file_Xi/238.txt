  GETTYA defence analyst has accused China of pinching military technologies from the USDespite President Trump’s recent visit to Beijing which gave the appearance of warm relations between the two powers, China is narrowing the military-technology gap with the US by allegedly hacking American defence contractors in order to pinch their high-tech designs.The news comes as China threatens to take the lead in artificial intelligence (AI) developments too, with growing concerns it could be used to further improve the country’s military.Harry Kazianis, director of defence studies at the Centre for the National Interest think tank, said: "What Beijing has been very good at is targeting US defence contractors, getting into their computer systems through various types of essentially cyber warfare and stealing the designs of some of America's best military assets.” Related articles   REVEALED: US military options to WIPE OUT North Korean threat   'China and Russia MUST ACT' Trump demands backing over North Korea  Although China and the US announced a cyber-hacking truce between the two countries in 2015, Mr Kazianis believes Beijing could bypass the deal by stationing Chinese agents in other countries.He warned: “So we don't even have a good idea if they stopped. "It's obviously a huge, huge problem."China’s new J-20 fighter jets are among the types of military equipment thought to have been developed with help from industrial espionage.

    Mr Kazianis believes the Chinese have been able to hack into computer networks to steal designs and other information on US carriers, advanced defence systems and jets including the F-22 and F-35 types.The news comes after the US and china discussed the disputed South china Sea during a visit to Beijing by President Trump on Thursday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said.He told reporters: "We had a frank exchange here in China on maritime security issues and the South China Sea. The US position remains unchanged."We insist on upholding freedom of navigation, that claimants be consistent with international law and that claimants should stop construction and militarisation of outposts in order to maximise prospects for successful diplomacy.” Donald Trump's Asia tour in pictures Mon, November 13, 2017Donald Trump and Melania Trump embark on a 12-day trip to five different Asian nations which are Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines Play slideshow  REUTERS1 of 100Thailand's PM Prayut Chan-o-Cha, Vietnam's PM Nguyen Xuan Phuc, U.S. President Trump, Philippine's President Rodrigo Duterte and Singapore's PM Lee Hsien Loong pose for a family photo during the ASEAN-US 40th Anniversary commemorative Summit in Manila
