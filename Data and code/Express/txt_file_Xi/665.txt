Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!"  GETTYThe number of missile tests have increased considerably under Kim Jong-unThis was followed by North Korea accusing Donald Trump of declaring war on the hermit kingdom after the US President berated Kim Jong-un’s authoritarian dictatorship.In a tirade published through state propaganda mouthpiece Rodong Sinmun, Kim’s regime took aim at a speech Trump made to his South Korean allies.The statement said: “Trump astounded the international community by ridiculously distorting and manipulating the reality of our Republic and ripping out all kinds of curse against us for whopping 22 minutes in his 35-minute speech at the puppet National Assembly in Seoul.”Describing the US President as a “cockroach” and “bacteria”, the newspaper added: “We deem Trump's slanders as a declaration of war to overthrow our regime.”
