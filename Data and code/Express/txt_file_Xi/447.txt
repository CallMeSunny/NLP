  GETTY - STOCK IMAGEThe Office for National Statistics figures show there are 3.4million foreign workers in the UKThere are 3.4million foreign workers in total with 2.2million from EU countries with people from Romania and Bulgaria working the longest hours for the lowest wages. The figure of 2.2million has virtually doubled since 2010 in line with EU expansion, though the number of migrant workers from outside the EU is almost unchanged. This country needs and welcomes controlled immigration but the surge in numbers due to the open-door policy over such a short period makes all too plain the dangers that this newspaper has warned about for years.  Related articles   ‘UK workforce can be self-sufficient after Brexit’ - think-tank chief   Businesses 'face scrap for foreign staff' as immigration rules tighten   GETTY - STOCK IMAGEThere has been a surge in immigration numbers due to the open-door policy Not all migrants are economically active and their presence adds pressures to hospitals, schools and housing, which are in danger of becoming unsustainable. As Alp Mehmet of Migration Watch says: “Business must now focus on recruiting and training from the domestic workforce and wean itself off the cheaper east European option.” This may present problems after Brexit for we are used to EU workers doing the jobs that many Britons have not been prepared to do. This has to change and it presents a real challenge for the industries and areas of employment that have been used to cheap EU workers for a long time.-----------------------------------  GETTYXi Jinping has urged Donald Trump to defuse the situation between Washington and PyongyangPowers circle North KoreaChina has moved 150,000 troops to its border with North Korea as tensions rise between Washington and Pyongyang.The Chinese leader Xi Jinping has urged Donald Trump to defuse the situation. The American president has said that he is “sending an armada” towards North Korea and that leader Kim Jong-un is “doing the wrong thing” and “looking for trouble”.    Meanwhile, North Korea declares: “Our revolutionary strong army is keenly watching every move by enemy elements with our nuclear sight focused on the US invasionary forces.” These are alarming developments and it is to be hoped that the Chinese will calm the situation. It was all very well for Mr Trump to use Twitter as his favourite mouthpiece when he was running for office but with world peace in jeopardy, gunboat diplomacy by tweet is foolhardy.----------------------------------- A stunning view of the White Garden in pictures Wed, April 12, 2017Complementing Kensington Palace’s exhibition, Diana: Her Fashion Story, the garden will be planted with flowers and foliage inspired by memories of the Princess’s life, image and style.

    Blooming lovely princessKensington Palace’s White Garden, designed in memory of Princess Diana on the 20th anniversary of her death, has bloomed early because of the mild weather. Beautiful and unpredictable, rather like the lady herself. A very fitting tribute.
