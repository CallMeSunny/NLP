   The USS Carl Vinson strike group’s 5,500 soldiers will arrive in Danang on Monday, the same port which served as a major staging post for the US war effort in the country.It will be the first time a large number of US troops have set foot on Vietnamese soil since 1975.The four-day port call will allow US troops to visit an orphanage and a centre for victims of Agent Orange, a powerful herbicide used by the US military which is blamed for leaving generations of Vietnamese with serious health issues including cancer, birth defects, and severe psychological and neurological problems.Rear Admiral John V. Fuller, the commander of the Carl Vinson strike group, whose father served in Vietnam, said: “It’s a pretty big and historic step, since a carrier has not been here for 40 years.

When Trump took office last January it appeared as though tensions in the region would be a high priority on his foreign affairs agenda, but with Washington’s attention elsewhere, China has been given free reign to enjoy its disputed claims to the neighbouring sea.Michael Fuchs, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, admitted to CNN: "The water was beautiful for China in the South China Sea in 2017."The Chinese continue to pace with their long-term strategy to gain de facto control over the sea lanes in the South China Sea. And what changed is the United States stopped paying attention.”
