   Chinese exports have recorded a shock fall, slumping by 4.4 percent in the last month of 2018, representing the largest fall for two years. Lowering demand in most of Beijing’s key export markets have been blamed on the fall while its stumbling domestic economy registered a massive 7.6 percent fall in imports due to less than expected demand among Chinese consumers. China’s results were the first signpost to frighten economists whose fears have been compounded by a slump on the continent.
