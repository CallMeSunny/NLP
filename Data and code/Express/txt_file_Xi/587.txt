  The World Bank predicts "darkening skies" for the global economy in 2019 (Image: GETTY)The organisation’s report has forecasted a slowdown of growth to 2.9 percent this year and 2.8 percent next year, but the chances of a recession will skyrocket if the US economy takes a negative hit.Spiralling tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping now affect 2.5 percent of global trade.The percentage of trade affected would be double if further tariffs discussed are implemented.
