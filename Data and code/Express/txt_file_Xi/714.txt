Queen Elizabeth: She also visited the Great Wall of China with Prince Philip (Image: Getty)Another first for the British royal family was a state visit to Morocco with the Queen visiting in 1980.This trip, however, was later dubbed the “tour from hell” thanks to a number of problems.King Hassan II, the leader of Morocco, caused some issues including reprimanding her staff and leaving the Queen by herself in the sun for hours.Thankfully, it was later reported that Queen Elizabeth was “fond” of the leader despite this and thanks him for their warm welcome to the country.The only other royals to have visited since are Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, in 2011.
