   Malaysia’s leader Mahathir Mohamad expressed his sympathy for “poor Americans” who have been subjected to harmful imports from China.But he warned the US president to be less confrontational and try to negotiate with his Chinese counterpart if he doesn’t want to find himself in a real war.Speaking at the respected international affairs think tank Chatham House in London on Monday, Mr Mahathir said: “Always try to have a dialogue with them, talk with them.“I don’t think the Chinese are so bad that you cannot talk with them.  Related articles   TRADE WAR: WTO, IMF, World Bank seek ‘URGENT’ trade reforms   Trump Tennessee rally LIVE: US President hosts latest campaign event  You can negotiate in increasing import duties on goods coming from China, which actually hurt poor AmericansMahathir Mohamad“They are open to negotiation.“You can negotiate in increasing import duties on goods coming from China, which actually hurt poor Americans."Mr Mahathir also advised Mr Trump against sending part of the US military fleet to the South China Sea, one of the most contended areas in the world.He said: “He should not send the Seventh Fleet there, because if you do that, you are going to provoke the Chinese, and they will send their fleet.“There will be tension…and they might shoot at each other.   Donald Trump was warned against 'provoking' China (Image: GETTY)“When you have a conflict, you either negotiate, or arbitrate or go to a court of law, and when you go to a court of law, you must accept the results.”The ongoing dispute between China and the US over territorial control in the area worsened over the weekend, when Washington “asserted its right” to sail warships past the contended Spratly islands.In the early 2010s, the US began deploying military ships and aircraft to the region, in a bid to dismiss Beijing’s territorial claims, which the White House branded “excessive maritime claims”.The move comes less than a week after Mr Trump accused China of meddling in the upcoming midterm elections with the intention of crippling his party’s chances to win a majority in the House of Representatives.  Related articles   OIL PRICE CRISIS: Trump sanctions could trigger HUGE shortage   China v USA: October summit could be CANCELLED as trade tension soars   Malaysia’s president Mahathir Mohamad (Image: GETTY)  China's president Xi Jinping (Image: GETTY)During a Security Council meeting at the annual UN General Assembly gathering, Mr Trump said: "They do not want me, or us, to win because I am the first President ever to challenge China on trade.” This, together with the warship coming close to the disputed islands, widened the rift between the countries, with China cancelling on Sunday an annual security meeting with US Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to The New York Times.Tensions have been high between the two world powers since Mr Trump slapped China with tariffs on £60billion of imported goods in March.In September, Mr Trump’s administration announced tariffs on further £200bn.   Donald Trump accused China of meddling in the US election (Image: GETTY)Upon issuing the new tariffs, Mr Trump said: “For months, we have urged China to change these unfair practices, and give fair and reciprocal treatment to American companies.“We have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made, and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly.“But, so far, China has been unwilling to change its practices.”China’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, said: "International trade is complementary and win-win by nature.“It should not be a zero-sum game in which one gains at the expense of others, and no one should be allowed to place its own interest above the interest of others.”
