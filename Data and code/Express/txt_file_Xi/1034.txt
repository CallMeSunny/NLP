   German EU Commissioner Gunther Oettinger has called for steps to be taken against China taking over European infrastructure. The issue arose after Italy initiated its entry into the “New Silk Road”, known as the project linking China to Europe, which the EU has been critical of. China has become the first G7 nation to sign a memorandum of understanding with China agreeing to take part in Beijing’s trade and infrastructure scheme, which is known as the Belt and Road initiative.

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has also criticised Italy.Mr Maas said: “In a world with giants like China, Russia or our partners in the United States, we can only survive if we are united as the EU. And if some countries believe that they can do clever business with the Chinese, then they will be surprised when they wake up and find themselves dependent.“China is not a liberal democracy.”Additional reporting by Monika Pallenberg
