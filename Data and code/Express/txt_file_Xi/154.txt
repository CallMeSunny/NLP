Echoing comments made by US Vice President Mike Pence, who said China had made “predatory” economic practices in the past, Mr Roach said the trade war could see both nations plunge into a Cold War should things get worse. Referring to Mr Pence and former US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, Mr Roach told CNBC: “What Mike Pence said is that these are going to be longstanding issues and that raises the possibility — echoed by a speech that Hank Paulson gave a couple of weeks ago — that we could be entering a Cold War with China that would last for a long, long time.”   He also said: “I think the end game is that this is a clash between two systems. And the U.S. is objecting to a state-sponsored 'market-based socialist system' that uses the largess of the state to subsidise industrial policy.”The rift between two of the world’s largest economies is expected to dominate the summit, which will be attended by all world leaders.It began when Mr Trump triggered the conflict in Beijing at the start of the year, when he accused China of “unfair” trade practices and intellectual property theft.
