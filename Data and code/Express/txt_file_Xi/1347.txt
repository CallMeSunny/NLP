   On Thursday, the US State Department imposed sanctions against China’s defence procurement agency, the Equipment Development Department (EED).The State Department noted the imposition of sanctions was due to Beijing’s “significant transactions” with Russian arms exporter Rosoboronexport.The Chinese ministry responded to the tariffs, stating: “The Chinese side has made the decision to immediately call back People's Liberation Army Navy head, Shen Jinlong, who was taking part in the 23rd International Seapower Symposium and planned to make a visit to the US.”China has ”strongly urged" the US to cancel the sanctions or "bear the consequences".
