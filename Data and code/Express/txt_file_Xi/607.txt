     A lot of Chinese people would affectionately call you in Chinese Auntie May. That’s really a kind of a call for Chinese – you’re one of the members of the family. Do you like that?Chinese state TVShe and husband Philip later continued the charm offensive by telling President Xi Jinping how much they liked Chinese tea.Served Lapsang Souchong at a traditional tea ceremony with Mr Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan, Mr May told Madame Peng: “We drink that.”Meanwhile International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, in China with Mrs May, called for an end to Tory carping over her leadership.He said: “They [China] are looking at performance...and they look at the Prime Minister in a different way than some of, let’s say, the internal tea room discussions in the UK do.”
