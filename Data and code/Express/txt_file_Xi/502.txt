The 1997 film Tomorrow Never Dies featured an evil media mogul bringing Britain and China to the brink of war before Bond and Wai Lin, a Chinese spy, agreed to work together to defeat the crooks.But the filmakers have been careful to avoid portraying China's Communist government as the enemy. As a result, the Bond franchise has become popular in China.The VIP visitors met Michael Wilson, one of the producers of SPECTRE, who said that the car was one of only 10 produced especially for the film by Aston Martin, and designed with the help of the film’s director Sam Mendes.“The president asked which film it was for, and I said it was the current film.

Kate once used both regularly but those days are over.
