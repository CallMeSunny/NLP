    Boris Johnson said the new measures were "the most stringent UN sanctions regime placed on any nation in the 21st century".He said: "The international community has shown it is united against the illegal and reckless acts by the North Korean regime."This resolution will curtail gas, petrol and oil imports."It will ban all textile exports, taking hundreds of million dollars from the export revenues that the North Korean regime uses to fund its illegal nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. And it will end the exploitation of DPRK labourers abroad."The North Korean regime bears full responsibility for the measures that the UN Security Council has enacted today. It is their continued, illegal and aggressive actions that have brought us to this point, and it is North Korea that must change its course."
