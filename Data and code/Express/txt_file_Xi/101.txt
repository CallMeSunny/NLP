   A senior White House official said President Trump will ask Mr Xi to cut its financial links with Kim Jong-un’s regime to further pressure the hermit state into giving up its nuclear weapons programme.The pair are set to meet just a day after the US leader issued a stark warning to dictator Kim, telling him “do not underestimate us, do not try us”.Beijing is the North’s main ally and main trading parter, so any deal to convince tyrant Kim to stop pursuing more powerful nuclear weapons and avert a potential conflict on the Korean Peninsula will need China’s full support.  But Washington has previously accused Mr Xi’s government of shirking its responsibilities and not making good on its commitments to fully implement UN sanctions against the regime.Mr Trump is also considering declaring North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism at some point during his 12-day East Asia trip, the official told reporters aboard Air Force One.

    And during his election campaign, the US leader said the Asian giant deliberately devaluing its currency to increase the deficit even further. Mr Trump arrived in the Chinese capital with First Lady Melania on Wednesday afternoon local time following stops in Japan and South Korea.Speaking in Seoul yesterday, Mr Trump used some of his toughest language yet against Kim’s North Korean regime.He warned the despot his nuclear weapons programme was "not making you safer”, but the continued development was only serving to put “your regime in grave danger”.The President went on to encourage countries across the world to further isolate the hermit state by denying it “any form of support, supply or acceptance.”His 12-day tour will also take him to Vietnam and the Philippines.
