  BARCROFTFrightened people are evacuated after fears of a poison gas cloudAnother 95 people are still unaccounted for.The increase in fatalities came as Chinese authorities confirmed that hundreds of tons of deadly sodium cyanide had been discovered at two locations on the blast site.More than 720 people remained in hospital four days after the disaster in the densely populated industrial city, which sent massive yellow and orange fireballs into the sky on Wednesday.The explosions in a warehouse containing hazardous chemicals were so powerful that few of the bodies have been identified.Most of those still missing are firefighters, according to officials.About 6,300 residents within two miles were evacuated after a change in wind direction prompted fears that toxic particles could be blown towards homes.Meanwhile angry protests were staged by relatives of the missing as well as residents fearing damage to their health.Gen Shi Luze, a senior military officer, acknowledged the presence of toxins but said there would be “no secondary damage to the people”.He said workers were trying to clear the area of chemicals before possible rain showers could create toxic gas.Reports claimed up to 700 tons of sodium cyanide – 70 times the permitted amount – was stored on the site, with some suggesting the company that owned the warehouse where the blasts originated, Rui Hai International Logisitics, may have been transporting chemicals illegally.President Xi Jin-ping urged disaster operation leaders to enforce tighter safety measures after it emerged that firefighters may have made the situation worse by dousing burning chemicals with water.Officials said they had identified 24 of the dead and were using DNA tests to help confirm the identities of the rest.
