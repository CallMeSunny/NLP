   Kim Jong-un visited the Chinese President after what is believed to be the leader's first trip outside of the rogue nation since his ascent to power.North Korea expert Gordon Chang said the meeting is “not good” for the United States, who, without China, can “push around” North Korea.Mr Chang insisted China must be “pushed to the sidelines” or it could be impossible to shut down North Korea’s nuclear regime.Speaking on Fox News, he said: “If they’ve got China on their back it becomes much more difficult. During the Six-party talks, which started in August 2003, China was generally a malign influence – generally pressuring the United States and the international community more than pressuring the North Koreans.

So, it's important for the United States to push China off to the sidelines again.”Mr Chang also revealed that Chinese ruler Xi Jinping met with the North Korean leader to show he is still in charge.He added: “President Trump relegated him to the sidelines by agreeing to meet with Kim directly. Therefore, cutting the Chinese out.   “Cutting the Chinese out is a good thing. So I think Xi Jinping wanted to reinsert himself into the process.”Security expert Jim Hanson warned that North Korea must shut down its nuclear programme or risk having its regime turned into “radioactive rubble” by President Trump.Mr Hanson warned North Korean leader Kim Jong-un must shut down the nuclear regime or face military action by the US.Donald Trump has agreed to meet with the North Korean leader but no details have so far been confirmed.Mr Trump was told Mr Kim’s meeting with President Xi “went very well” and said he is keen to meet with the North Korean leader.The leader of the hermit kingdom is already believed to have left the Asian superstate but during his meeting with the Chinese President he revealed he is “committed to denuclearisation” on the Korean peninsula, after sparking World War 3 fears with a series of missile tests.
