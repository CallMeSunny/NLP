    May: Iranian electionIran’s President Hassan Rouhani faces opposition from hardliners as he prepares to stand for re-election in May. The election result will shape Iran’s future foreign policy and will have a far-reaching influence on the Middle East and other parts of the world. Mr Rouhani’s nuclear deal with America and other world powers led to the lifting of sanctions. He has said Iran will not let Mr Trump rip up the deal.  Autumn: German electionLongtime German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a bastion of the EU and one of the world’s most powerful leaders. If Mrs Merkel loses the next election, it will be a massive blow to the EU and the liberal world order in the West.  Russia could try to turn public opinion against Mrs Merkel this year after allegedly helping Mr Trump in the US election.    Autumn: China’s Communist Party congressChinese leader Xi Jinping will attempt to consolidate his power at the Communist Party of China congress towards the end of the year. China is playing an increasingly influential role on the world stage at a time when Mr Trump may try to make America more isolationist. The global economy is also set to be affected by China’s economic slowdown after many years of rapid growth.
