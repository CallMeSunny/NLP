  MET POLICEPolice are looking for the jogger who pushed a woman on Putney BridgeHe had been named in a tip-off and was therefore a suspect.What was absolutely not right was to mount a dawn raid on his house and then lead him away in handcuffs to spend hours in a cell when right from the start his alibi was watertight. He wasn't even in the country at the time.What should have happened was for police to have arrived at an appropriate hour and to have quietly questioned him at home.  Related articles   Jogger rage: What is it about running that gets people so wound up?   Man arrested in connection with Putney Bridge incident released The instant he said he was in the States and could prove it the police should have looked at the documents and then gone away. Nobody would have been any the wiser, sparing him much distress and the police much criticism.That is what once would have been the norm for policing in this country: investigate as much as possible before arrest. Now people are forcibly arrested at the drop of a hat or at any rate at the drop of an email or telephone call and the line between suspect and perpetrator has become blurred, as any man falsely accused of rape will tell you.   As if that isn't enough some policemen, whose chiefs are always complaining of a lack of manpower and resources, now think it an appropriate use of time and tax to worry about the signs in supermarkets indicating where women's sanitary protection is to be found.Even the usual vocal feminists are bemused by the actions of Sergeant Peter Allan who is supposed to be a hate crime officer in Sussex. He castigated supermarkets for displaying signs for "feminine protection" which in his crazy world are insufficiently gender neutral. Presumably there is no real hate crime in Sussex for him to investigate? He should get a life and preferably one far removed from the police force, which is supposed to tackle crime, not supermarket signs.I say again the police have no role in political correctness, enforcing good manners, controlling thought and opinions or settling every private squabble and they certainly have no business interfering with shopping signs. The Home Secretary should tell them so.---------------------------------------------------------------------  GETTYPrincess Diana boasted she pushed her stepmother down the stairs in Diana: Her Own WordsViolent actions have lowered my opinion of DianaDiana, the late Princess of Wales, boasted that she pushed her then 60-year-old stepmother Raine Spencer down the stairs in a fit of rage and that it gave her "enormous satisfaction".If anybody else pushed a pensioner down the stairs she would have been lucky to have escaped the constabulary but this crackpot of a young woman got away with the violence, doubtless through the discretion of her bruised and shaken victim.The more I read of Diana in her own words the less I warm to her, although I still feel she was badly let down by the grown-ups who should have stopped the marriage, which neither party by then wanted.Meanwhile polls seem to suggest that the prospect of Camilla becoming Queen is still broadly unpopular but I think Charles should be patient.The problem about that is advocating patience to someone who will be starting his life's work at an age when most men have long since retired.--------------------------------------------------------------------- Kodi guide - All the devices you own that can run this streaming app Thu, March 9, 2017KODI is legal if used correctly and here's all the devices that can run this streaming software.

    When things are built to fail it is frustrating, expensive and bad for the planetMy biggest beef against modern technology is not its complexity but rather its built-in obsolescence. Recently two apps in my decidedly limited store ceased to work. I consulted my technology chap and was told the (very basic) apps were no longer compatible with my iPhone. To obtain them I must trade up my perfectly satisfactory iPhone 4 for an iPhone 7 or if I cared to wait a little the all singing, all dancing iPhone 8. But, I protested, my current phone is fine. It is just that apps which worked perfectly a few weeks ago no longer do. Change the phone or do without was the essence of his more courteously phrased response. Then the stand for my Tom-Tom broke. I could not find a new one on the net which was compatible with my current, elderly Tom-Tom. So I shall have to find a used one on eBay or upgrade to a new Tom-Tom which I do not need.It isn't only technology. People keep telling me how well my 10-year-old Ford Focus is doing yet my first car, a Morris Minor, was still going strong at 23 and had plenty of life left when I finally and reluctantly sold it for six times that which I paid. Individual frustration and expense apart, it doesn't do much for the planet, does it?---------------------------------------------------------------------  GETTY - STOCKIt is belated sanity to allow learner drivers on motorways New drivers need to gain experienceI passed my driving test in 1971. In the weeks that followed I had to learn parallel parking, nightdriving and motorwaydriving, none of which were then included in the test but which suddenly I was deemed fully competent to do.It is much belated sanity to allow learners on motorways provided they are accompanied by a government-approved instructor and driving a dual-control car.Then there was the problem of driving in central London when I had passed in the comparatively tiny Chichester, after learning in rural Surrey. My heart used to hammer as other drivers swapped lanes round me, expecting me to do the same as there was nothing to indicate I was new to driving.I have believed ever since that there is a strong case for newly qualified drivers to be made to display warning plates for six months so that other drivers can exercise both extra caution and extra understanding.As the law currently stands, P plates are not compulsory and many seasoned drivers would not have a clue what they mean. How odd in a country so obsessed with health and safety.--------------------------------------------------------------------- North Korea v USA explosive latest pictures Wed, September 20, 2017Images depict how tensions have escalated between North Korea and the United States.

    President Trump may have been a teeny bit undiplomatic towards the lunatic in North Korea but he had already warned Xi Jinping as long ago as April that if China did not deal with the situation then America would, since when China has taken no effective action.It is a simple fact of life that the world cannot wait for Kim Jong-un to get a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the greatest superpower. He must be stopped now and if China won't take the responsibility then Trump must. End of.---------------------------------------------------------------------  GETTY - STOCKBig Ben will be silenced for four years due to conservation workTry to find a compromiseIt is understandable that the company renovating Big Ben wants to look after its workers but I cannot help feeling that some compromise might be possible whereby we are not bongless for four years.Might it be possible, for example, to have Big Ben chiming when the builders are not on the site.I need a lot of convincing that the workers will always be in the danger area, which is to say close to the bells throughout the whole fouryear period.On this occasion I will buy into health and safety but only if proportionately applied.
