   China accomplished an audacious mission to land on the far side of the moon in a historic moment in space exploration this week. Chang’e 4’s touch down was lauded around the world as a major technical feat representing an ascendent Chinese state. And the impressive science mission is only the beginning of an ambitious space program which plans to challenge the hegemony of a stagnating NASA, an expert has exclusively revealed to Express.co.uk.

Scientists aim at Einstein's theory of gravity Dr Malcolm Davis, senior analyst in defence strategy and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, believes there are broad implications to the Chinese Chang’e 4 lunar mission. China is wanting to personally develop the sorts of military space capabilitiesDr Malcolm DavisThese are due to the Moon’s increasing militarily strategic importance and the Communist state’s growing technological prowess.Dr Davis said: “China is a rising superpower and they are clearly challenging the US in space leadership.“The Chinese clearly have an ambitious space program that will include further missions to the Moon, culminating in human lunar missions with a lunar base. READ MORE: NASA plan to dig 10km hole in ALIEN LIFE search - REVEALED  Chang’e 4 Moon landing: China's mission to the far side of the Moon marks an astro-political epoch (Image: Getty/PA)  China Chang’e 4 Moon landing: The mission is a major technical feat (Image: PA)“And they will have a space station up by 2022 which will potentially supplant the International Space Station (ISS), if funding runs out for that.”The strategy analyst believes there are three reasons for China’s extraterrestrial ambitions, military concerns, national honour and a hunger for resources.“China is wanting to personally develop the sorts of military space capabilities to allow infomationalisation warfare – giving them the ability to fight the sorts of wars with information systems that you saw the US use in the 1991 Gulf War and Iraq.“This is essential for them to be an effective power, and satellites and space capabilities are vital to that.READ MORE: Hunt for aliens ‘only just BEGINNING’ says top scientist Related articles   Alien life search ‘only just BEGINNING’ says top scientist   Black hole BREAKTHROUGH: Black holes actually ‘FOUNTAIN’ shaped “Paraphrasing General Montgomery ‘If we lose control of space, we lose the war and we lose it quickly.’“The second aspect of the military side of things is to deny space to their opponents, through the development of counter space capabilities and anti-satellite weapons.”National prestige also play a part in China’s long-term plans to control space.“China will argue its time has come, geopolitically – it is returning as the Middle Kingdom – the centre of power on the planet.“It was Xi Jinping’s intention, when you look at his policies at prompting Chinese perspectives on international governance and development through the Belt and Road initiative, and they even have a space Silk Road concept to get states to align with China through systems like Baidu.READ MORE: Was Einstein WRONG?
