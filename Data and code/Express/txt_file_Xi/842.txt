    During a different speech at the Reagan National Defence Forum, the advisor warned that the hermit kingdom represents “the greatest immediate threat to the United States”.When questioned about the potential for war between the US and the isolationist kingdom, he added: "I think it's increasing every day, which means that we are in a race, really, we are in a race to be able to solve this problem.”"There are ways to address this problem short of armed conflict, but it is a race because he's getting closer and closer, and there's not much time left.”He also declared that despot leader Kim Jong-un would be unlikely to alter his offensive rhetoric "without some significant new actions in the form of much more severe sanctions" and "complete enforcement of the sanctions that are in place."Following the rogue nation’s most powerful missile test yet, Donald Trump pledged that he would “take care” of the situation.He said: “It is a situation that we will handle."  GETTYHerbert Raymond McMaster announced the US is going to 'take care of' the hermit kingdomFollowing the latest missile test, Trump spoke to South Korean president Moon Jae-in, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Japan’s Shinzo Abe in an effort to tighten Asia’s grip on its threatening neighbour.Reports suggest that during a phone conversation with Mr Xi, the Republican firebrand requested China cut off vital oil supplies to Kim Jong-un in an effort to cripple his aggressive regime.However, it appears that China is attempting to balance its relationship between the US and North Korea.  GETTYKim Jong-un recently tested his most powerful missile yetWhen Express.co.uk recently spoke to CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton, he detailed that China has a limit to its aggressive rhetoric against North Korea due to fears of a refugee crisis if the Kim regime were to implode.He stated: “China is trying hard to exercise what leverage they can over North Korean’s, but they want to make sure that they don’t set up conditions that would allow for the collapse of the North Korean regime.“They don’t want the refugees to come in, they don’t want the economic dislocation and they certainly don’t want a powerful unified Korea on their border.”
