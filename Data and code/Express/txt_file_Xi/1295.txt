   The two economic powerhouse nations have agreed not to enforce any more trade tariffs for at least 90 days while they hold talks to resolve existing disputes. Washington and Beijing have put pressure on global trade and sparked concerns of an economic slowdown in recent months after being locked in a bitter trade war as they slap strings of sanctions on each other. But the escalation was briefly paused over the weekend as Mr Trump tweeted that China had agreed to cut import tariffs on American-made cars.
