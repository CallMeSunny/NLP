    But the announcment from the North Korean government appears to contradict South Korean and US officials who earlier said Tuesday’s launch was of an intermediate-range missile.US Pacific Command confirmed the test and said it was a land-based missile that flew for 37 minutes - adding it did not pose a threat to North America. The launch is just the latest in a series of provocations amid heightened tensions over the hermit state and despot leader Kim Jong UN’s nuclear weapons ambitions.And today's test-launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile, if confirmed, could be a game-changer for countries hoping to halt North Korea’s continued nuclear programe.Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the missile flew "for about 40 minutes" with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe telling reporters: "This launch clearly shows that the threat has grown." The US, Japan and South Korea will hold a summit on the sidelines of this week's G20 meeting on the issue.  REUTERSThe launch is the first ICBM test from North Korea Mr Suga added: “Also I will encourage President Xi Jinping and President Putin to take more constructive measures."The launch follows talks, yesterday, between US President Donald Trump and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe that they would increase pressure on North Korea in cooperation with South Korea.Mr Trump reiterated that an era of “strategic patience” over North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs had ended.And he launched a personal attack on Kim Jong-un, asking if he has “anything better to do with his life”.  REUTERSPrime Minister Shinzo Abe warned the Korea threat 'has grown'   The President tweeted: “North Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?“Hard to believe that South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer.“Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!”
