  GETTYPrince William gets friendly with an elephantThe Duke of Cambridge joins those other giants of the environment movement, Sir David Attenborough and Dame Jane Goodall, as the leading Britons preventing many of our iconic creatures slipping into oblivion. Other names on the Wildlife Power List published tomorrow are Springwatch presenter Chris Packham, Green MP Caroline Lucas as well a host of politicians, scientists, authors, bloggers and campaigners.The list of Britain’s 50 “most influential conservation heroes” has been compiled by BBC Wildlife Magazine at a time when the struggle to protect species as well as the precious spaces they need for survival are coming under increasing threats at home and abroad.Climate change, urban sprawl and the international threat posed by ivory and rhino horn poachers for the multi-billion pound illegal wildlife trade are all changing the face of the planet and also pushing huge numbers of animals and plants towards the brink.BBC Wildlife asked a team of experts to nominate people they feel have potential to change the fortunes of wildlife and the way we experience the natural world over the coming decade.The results are published in the magazine’s May issue out tomorrow. These are the people who we believe will shape the way we see the natural world in the coming years and who have the greatest potential to deliver a positive outcome for wildlife both in the UK and abroadYou will have to see the magazine for the list in its entirety but, along with the well-known names, it also includes a street artist who paints endangered species on urban walls as well as two 13-year-olds.Prince William is placed fifth on the list through his work highlighting the perils faced by elephants and rhinos from poaching. With his father, the Prince of Wales, he has helped bring world leaders to the table for discussions on how we preserve precious megafauna for future generations to enjoy.The Magazine says: “Prince William’s decision to back a new global campaign against wildlife crime might come to be seen as a tipping point in the war against the illegal wildlife trade. “Can his charity, United for Wildlife, stem the demand for products from rhinos, elephants, tigers, pangolins, sharks and other species? He has the ear of Chinese president Xi Jinping, and images of him standing on an anti-poaching podium with David Beckham and former basketball player Yao Ming (a huge celebrity in China) have reached millions of smartphone screens where it matters – in the Far East. “It is William’s ability to attract celebrity endorsement and bring international politicians and conservation groups together that makes him such a potent force for change.” Related articles   Charity warns of growing gap between children and nature  Dream Gardens: How the other half lives  Angry Birds company join the fight against extinctionDoyen of wildlife documentary-makers, Sir David Attenborough is placed fourth on the list, with the magazine praising the 89-year-old for “relentlessly pushing boundaries in his epic natural history programmes.”The magazine adds: “Previously criticised for glossing over harsh conservation realities in his gorgeous wildlife documentaries, the veteran presenter has increasingly voiced his fears about climate change, human overpopulation, Creationism and the English badger cull, among many other issues.”Primatologist Dame Jane Goodall is also feted for her position as the most influential British conservationist. Her eponymous Jane Goodall Institute is a huge community-focussed organisation which sees her travelling the globe on speaking tours 300 days a year. The Institute works with villagers across five chimpanzee range states in Africa, and its Roots & Shoots youth movement has 150,000 members spread across 130 countries.The two 13-year-olds who make it on the Wildlife Power List are blogger Findlay Wilde and bone collector Jake McGowan.    SPThe May issue of BBC wildlife features David Attenborough, Chris Packham and Jane GoodallFindlay might not be able to vote until 2020 but is described as being “more politically than many experienced conservation suits” and famously created the Harry the Hen Harrier fibreglass mascot being used to highlight crime against birds of prey.Since the age of six Jake has been collecting animal bones and now has one of the largest private collections in the country with more than 3,000 specimens. He has globally-followed website (jakes-bones.com) and is described as proving “hands-on biology is cool”.BBC Wildlife Magazine editor, Matt Swaine, says: “These are the people who we believe will shape the way we see the natural world in the coming years and who have the greatest potential to deliver a positive outcome for wildlife both in the UK and abroad. ”The May issue of BBC Wildlife Magazine is on sale May 13.
