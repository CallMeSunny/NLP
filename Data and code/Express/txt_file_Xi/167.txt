He told reporters he intervened in the deal between Rome and Beijing in a bid to stop EU member states straying from the bloc to seek their own prosperity. He said he and Mr Conte had "strategic discussions on China", with the aim of "defining a common strategy to overcome European divisions and affirm European sovereignty". Mr Macron added: “The time of naivety is over, yet there is not a complete alignment of our interests, but there is a strategic sharing.”   He then said "China is a systemic rival", but also "an economic partner" of the EU.Also at the meeting was German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Mr Conte confirmed.He said: “I spoke with Merkel and Macron.” Related articles   ‘Arrogant' Macron SLAMMED for ongoing Yellow Vest crisis   Macron in CRISIS - FURIOUS at 'COUP' top aides referred to prosecutors Referring to the sought after trade deal - a vast infrastructure programme - he added: “We talked about it today, I talked about it.

We we will keep each other updated.”The news comes after Mr Macron welcomed China’s President Xi Jinping for a private dinner near Nice yesterday.The dinner was part of China’s tour of Europe and an opportunity for Mr Macron, 41, to quiz him on an ambitious economic programme dubbed the "new Silk Road".
