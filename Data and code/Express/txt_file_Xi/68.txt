    And during his election campaign, Mr Trump frequently criticised China’s economic policies and said they were responsible for “stealing” US manufacturing jobs and slowing economic growth. He said Mr Xi’s Communist Party was deliberately devaluing its currency to make it easier and cheaper for American businesses and consumers to purchase goods produced there.Mr Trump went as far as making an election pledge to name China a “currency manipulator” on his first day in office, though he has yet to make good on the promise.Speaking on Monday, Mr Xi said he and Mr Trump had made considerable efforts to improve US-China relations.
