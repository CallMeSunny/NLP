    The Terminal High Altitude Area Defence system is an advanced missile protection system, which is currently being deployed in South Korea.Speaking to Russian media, Mr Xi said: “The deployment of the US THAAD missile defence system in South Korea does serious damage to the strategic security interests of all countries in the region, including China and Russia, and disrupts the regional strategic balance.”He went on to say: “[Russia and China have] similar view on the nature of the THAAD deployment and its negative impact” on the situation in the region, the Chinese leader also said, adding that the two countries maintain a close cooperation in dealing with this security problem. Relevant parties must stop THAAD deployment to the Republic of Korea and back away from this decisionXi Jinping, Chinese PresidentThe Chinese leader has been extremely critical of the THAAD system over fears China may become at risk of an attack from it North Korea.In a bid to align himself with Putin, days before he is set to meet the Russian leader, Mr Xi added: “Russia and China would take adequate measures to ensure their national security and strategic balance in the region both in cooperation with each other and on their own.”Issuing a stern warning, Mr Xi called on the “relevant parties to stop THAAD deployment to the Republic of Korea and back away from this decision”.   His comments could spark claims that Kim Jong-un’s recent nuclear tests are an outcome of military provocation.Last month, Pyongyang’s despot leader monitored a number of missile tests, and an expert claimed the communist state could launch a test every two weeks for the rest of the year.
