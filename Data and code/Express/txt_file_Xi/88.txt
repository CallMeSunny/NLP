  GETTYChinese Premier Xi Jinping and North Kprea's Kim Jong-unRelations between the neighbours have deteriorated at an alarming rate and there are growing fears that Beijing could turn on its ally.President Xi Jinping has been doing some serious sabre-rattling over the last few days, ordering his People’s Liberation Army to step up drills and digital combat readiness as the world’s second-biggest army launched unprecedented nationwide winter exercises.Troops in 4,000 sites across the country have been taking part in simultaneous drills in the armed forces’ annual new year exercises.Mr Xi said: “We will forge a powerful military that is ready to respond to the call, to fight and to win a war.

    Chinese security scholar Yang Xiyu said there was anger at Song Tao’s treatment in Pyongyang but also a more general discontent with Kim’s handling of the alliance.He suggested the Chinese Communist Party was beginning to regret vocally supporting Kim when he succeeded his father Kim Jong-il as leader in the critical years from 2009 to 2011 or at the very least feeling misled.Pyongyang’s response to China’s recent actions and statements is still awaited but experts warn China’s steadily diminishing public support or tacit acceptance of his regime is likely to lead to some sort of showdown.
