   The Chinese state visit will be marked by Italy’s move to become the first of the G7 group to officially endorse Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The move to support BRI has sparked concern in the EU, at a time when Italy’s populist coalition government has repeatedly clashed with Brussels. Brussels has recently labelled Beijing “a systemic rival” and Italy’s choice to forge ahead with the endorsement casts doubt on the unification of the EU.
