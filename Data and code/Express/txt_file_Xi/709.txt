  GETTYThe White House insists Presidents Trump and Xi are still "extremely close" despite the trade gap The President will call on his chief trade advisor, Robert Lighthizer, to open an investigation into China’s intellectual property practices on Monday.In doing so, Mr Trump will attempt to make good on a campaign promise to sort out America’s trade deficit, with Chinese imports currently dwarfing US exports by some £268n.An unnamed White House official told Politico the President was likely to order a Section 301 investigation under the 1974 Trade Act.They said the investigation would not mean immediate sanctions, but could ultimately lead to steep tariffs on Chinese goods.Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect US industries from “unfair trade practices” of foreign countries, such as trade agreement violations, or “discriminatory” actions that burden US commerce.

They know how I feel."If China helps us, I feel a lot different toward trade."

    Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Friday night, and reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearize the Korean peninsula."President Trump and President Xi agreed North Korea must stop its provocative and escalatory behaviour," the White House said in a statement.It added the "relationship between the two presidents is an extremely close one, and will hopefully lead to a peaceful resolution of the North Korea problem."Mr Trump is expected to make a day trip to Washington DC on Monday, briefly interrupting his 17-day August working vacation, to announce the investigation. In addition to the United States, the European Union, Japan, Germany and Canada have all expressed concern about China's behaviour on intellectual property theft. The technology sector has been especially hard hit in IP disputes.Trump's threat to investigate China's intellectual property and trade practices is valid, but his administration may not be up to the delicate task of carrying out a new China probe without sparking a damaging trade war, US business lobbyists said last week.
