If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!" Asked how concerned China was the war of words between Trump and North Korea could get out of control, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang described the situation as highly complex and sensitive.

GettyChina's Xi Jinping has repeatedly called on Mr Trump to be calm over North KoreaKim said the North would consider the "highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history" against the United States and that Trump's comments had confirmed his nuclear programme was "the correct path".The US president threatened in his maiden UN address on Tuesday to "totally destroy" the country of 26 million people if North Korea threatened the United States or its allies.North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb test on September 3, prompting another round of UN sanctions. Pyongyang said on Friday it might test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean.While China has been angered by North Korea's repeated nuclear and missile tests, it has also called for the United States and its allies to help lessen tension by reducing their military drills.US Air Force B-1B Lancer bombers escorted by fighters flew in international airspace over waters east of North Korea on Saturday in a show of force the Pentagon said indicated the range of military options available to Trump.Mr Lu said: “A continued rise in tensions on the peninsula, I believe, is not in the interests of any side.” For its part, China says it is committed to enforcing sanctions against North Korea.

    The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Monday said his decision to call a snap election would not distract his government from responding to North Korean threats, pledging to increase pressure if Pyongyang failed to halt its missile and nuclear weapons development.  Related videos   North Korea hold mass rally for Kim Jong-Un's New Year's Address   Tens of thousands attend mass anti-US rally in North Korea   Meteorologist: North Korea earthquake is different to previous tremors
