   But what would happen if Donald Trump dropped the mother of all nuclear bomb on Kim Jong-un's hermit nation?America’s largest tested nuclear weapon, Castle Bravo, equates to 15 megatons of radioactive mayhem.If Kim Jong-un’s posturing backfires and president Trump launches the warhead at Pyongyang, it is estimated that a staggering 2,354,690 people would perish.A further 616,070 would be injured and almost four million others would be affected by radiation poisoning.  GETTYIt is estimated millions would die if Donald Trump launched a nuclear strike on North Korea Related articles   Tubby tyrant Kim Jong-un cannot hurt the West, says Frederick Forsyth   BREAKING: US 'North Korea armada' fighter jet sent CRASHING into sea Such global landmarks as the Kim Il-sung Stadium of Ideals and the imposing Arch of Triumph would crumble.The fireball of the initial blast would have a radius of 43.2km and thermal radiation would spread for 293km downwind.This would either cover all of South Korea, the width of Japan and potentially down to Shanghai in China.     NUCLEARSECRETSThe fallout from an American nuclear assault on Pyongyang could be felt in South Korea and JapanThe fact president Trump would not want the fallout to poison his allies in the region means he would probably wait for the wind to be blowing northwards before he launches Castle Bravo, which would no doubt infuriate Chinese strongman Xi Jinping, who was with president Trump when he decided to attack Syrian airstrips.Radiation could even, with an easterly breeze, spread noxious radiation as far as Vladivostok, Russia.Of course, a nuclear volley would not be without risk for the Republican.Kim could retaliate in two ways - by nuking Seoul, or Los Angeles – although the jury is out as to whether the despot’s arsenal could reach US soil.The strength of Kim Jong-un’s nuclear warhead, if it exists, would be unknown, but there is more information about the strength of one he tested in 2013 than there is about his current models.  NUCLEARSECRETSThis is the fallout from a Chinese nuclear attack on New YorkThat device was 10 kilotons and would kill an estimated 77,670 people instantly if it was detonated in the sky above Seoul - a further 268,590 would suffer horrific injuries.If the tubby tyrant decided to actually strike his nemesis’ turf, it would only kill 48,940, although the downwind fallout would spread for 98.7km and potentially back within his own country if the wind blew in the wrong direction.Kim Jong-un could potentially strike Los Angeles, but American radar would most likely spot the weapon sailing across the North Pacific and shoot it out of the sky.However, if it landed in the downtown area, 86,710 people would perish and 214,910 others would be injured.The biggest threat to president Trump’s nation would be if China were so outraged by his obliteration of North Korea that they fired a nuclear weapon at New York.  NUCLEARSECRETSThis is the radius of the blast that would destroy BeijingEstimates show that it would kill 2,303,700 civilians and damage the health of 9,311,325 others.If the President had managed to make it out of his top floor Trump Tower penthouse in time to run to a bunker and order a retaliatory strike, the death toll in Beijing would far outweigh that of New York.Around 4,485,050 would die in a radioactive inferno - the fireball alone would be 25.6 km² - and a further five million would be injured.Some 13,599,93 would feel the long lasting effects of radiation, which causes cancer to rapidly spread throughout the body.Vladimir Putin could, at this stage, support his Chinese counterpart and this could spell disaster for president Trump, who would find himself picking through the charred remains of his once-great nation.

    President Putin has the largest nuclear weapon ever designed, the Tsar Bomba, which at 100 megatons is a formidable beast.If he dropped it on Washington DC it would be goodnight Vienna for the Trump regime - 2.4 million Americans would the blasted into infinity and a further six million would suffer radiation poisoning.The nuclear cloud would travel as far north as Quebec and as far south as Haiti.All the figures in this article were taken from nuclearsecrecy.com, designed by Alex Wellerstein.
