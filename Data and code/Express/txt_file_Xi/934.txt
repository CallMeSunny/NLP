   Mr Trump’s decision came as a surprise to many, including apparently his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who he subsequently fired earlier this week.The deal was apparently brokered by South Korean president Moon Jae-in when he met high-ranking delegates from the North during the Winter Olympics in PyoengChang, who supplied him with an invitation to relay to Mr Trump.The US President subsequently tweeted his acceptance and suggested a “deal was very much in the making”.However, his announcement caused a certain amount of consternation among North Korea’s neighbours China and Japan, with delegations of Southern diplomats being sent to Beijing and Tokyo where they met leader Xi Jinping and Shinzo Abo respectively to unruffle feathers.   GETTYJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hosted a South Korean delegation recently Related articles   Japanese PM opens parliament but rules out law change for North Korea   Japan PM survives worst political crisis of his career    GETTYMr Trump is said to have ruffled feathers by not consulting alliesThe announcement was also made without any input from Russia, which also shares a narrow land border with the DPRK.Jim Hoare, a research associate at SOAS University of London, who specialises in Japanese and Korean affairs, said: "I think the Japanese are certainly concerned that they were not consulted. “They see themselves as directly threatened and as a close ally of the US and they will be worried that their concerns might be ignored as Trump pursues glory and fame. “China clearly has interests but having steadily argued that it is for the US and the DPRK to sort out the problem would not expect to be involved. It will watch carefully, however.   “I’m not sure what the Japanese want, except not to lose USA support and military protection. "I think Trump worries them because of his impetuous ways and lack of knowledge but he is all there is.“Russia will watch and get involved if they think their interests are threatened.

    “Beyond that, I am not sure of what they will do – there is of course a long involvement but Kim Jong Un does not share his father or grandfather's links with Russia and the Soviet Union.”No time frame has so far been put on Mr Trump’s visit, or are there any details as to where it could take place.The announcement came as a major surprise given that the two leaders have spend much of the last 18 months firing insults at each other, with Mr Trump dubbing Kim “short and fat”, and Kim calling Mr Trump “fat”
