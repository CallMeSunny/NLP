It said: “Drilling soldiers and war preparations are the fundamental jobs and work focus of our military, and at no time should we allow any slack in these areas.“We should be well prepared for all directions of military struggle and comprehensively improve troops’ combat response in emergencies … to ensure we can meet the challenge and win when there is a situation.”Zeng Zhiping, a retired lieutenant colonel and military analyst based in Nanchang, said the move could be about the army flexing its muscles, adding that its timing suggests it is part of a plan for the year.Speaking to South China Morning Post, Mr Zhiping said: “During the 20 years I spent in the PLA before I left in 2004, military training to boost combat readiness was always one of our top tasks.

When training and preparation for war is highlighted at the beginning of a year it means this is a plan for the whole year, although we don’t know what the real intention behind the rhetoric is at this stage.”Taiwan’s former deputy defence minister Lin Chong-Pin insisted it was about showing the PLA’s strength.Mr Chong-Pin explained: “Prioritising military training and preparation for war is nothing more than a move to boost its diplomatic strength, which the PLA has been emphasising over the past four decades – though it has never gone into battle with any other country during that time.

It will only become more cautious when it starts rising more rapidly.”Relations between the US and China have reached new lows under US President Donald Trump, with a trade war and disagreements over Taiwan and the South China Sea.
