    Xi, 64, began consolidating power after becoming head of the Community party in late 2012.He began his second term as party chief last October and will be formally appointed by parliament to his second term as president later this week.The government said lifting term limits was a means to protect the authority of the party with Xi at its centre, while the party's official newspaper, People's Daily, has said the constitution changes do not mean life-long terms.Despite his role as Chinese president, Xi's positions as head of the party and head of the military are seen to be more important. None of the roles now have a formal term limit.
