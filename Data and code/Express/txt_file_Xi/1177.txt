   More than 1.8 million Britons have signed a petition to block Mr Trump’s visit in response to his ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.The petition argues: “Donald Trump should be allowed to enter the UK in his capacity as head of the US Government, but he should not be invited to make an official state visit because it would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen.”Theresa May has insisted that the visit will go ahead as planned, despite protests from politicians including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Scottish Consrvative leader Ruth Davidson.Parliament will debate the original petition on February 20, and a second one in favour of Mr Trump's visit which has garnered 260,000 signatures.More than 110 MPs signed a motion to stop Mr Trump from being allowed to address parliament if the visit goes ahead, despite a YouGov poll which found that 49 per cent of Brits support the plans.WHAT ARE THE SEVEN COUNTRIES TRUMP HAS BANNED?
