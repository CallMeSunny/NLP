   Kim Jong-un sent a rare congratulatory message to Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday at the end of China’s Communist Party Congress, wishing him “great success” as head of the nation.But the friendly gesture by the North Korean leader, who seldom issues personal messages, comes as China is being pressured by the international community to do more to rein in the North’s missile and nuclear tests that have raised tensions globally.Xi became China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong at the all-important week-long congress.The North’s state-run central news agency said Kim’s message expressed the conviction that the relations between the two parties and the two countries would develop in the interests of the peoples of the two countries.

US President Donald Trump seized the opportunity to call Xi in an effort to cosy up to North Korea's ally. When Xi was first appointed five years ago, Pyongyang sent a six-sentence-long congratulatory message that included phrases such as "strength of the mutual leadership, friendship and brotherhood.”This time, the note was only four sentences.North Korea and China often exchange routine diplomatic correspondence and ceremonial letters to each other on political anniversaries or political promotions, although personal messages to and from the leaders tend to be few.

It’s what they usually do and not surprising at all.”Relations between China and North Korea have worsened since Kim Jong-un took power in 2011.China did not want the rogue state governed by a third generation from the Kim family.China is the North’s sole major ally, and accounts for more than 90 percent of trade with the isolated country.
