   North Korea could be on its way to spark World War 3 after it launched yet another missile threatening world peace.Mr Bolton said: "The effort to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons is on the verge of global failure."That’s where we are unless we are prepared to consider the prospect of military force or China acts dramatically to overthrow the Kim regime or to help us reunite the two Koreas."China remains North Korea's only formal ally and is bound to intervene in military disputes between Pyongyang and the international community by a treaty signed in 1961.  SKY NEWS•GETTYNorth Korea news: China must intervene to halt World War 3 threatBejing dispatched an official envoy to North Korea after President Xi Jinping discussed the growing threat of World War 3 with US President Donald Trump during his tour of Asia.But it appears China failed to exercise the necessary pressure to defuse the aggressive rhetoric Kim Jong-un adopted against the United States and its allies. The former Ambassador to the UN blasted North Korea for refusing to end its nuclear weapon programme despite repeated demands from the international community.Speaking to Sky News, he said 25 years of diplomacy and sanctions had not hindered North Korea's rush to produce nuclear weapons, leaving no option but to take military action or accept a nuclear-armed North Korea.   Mr Bolton added that failing to stop North Korea could cost thousands of lives in South Korea as the Pyongyang would resort to terrorism to establish its international position.He continued: "I think as well we should take steps to protect against North Korean retaliation against South Korea."What they would probably do is attack the city of Seoul. North Korea strategy would be to commit an act of terrorism by killing innocent South Korean civilians. And that’s what they are prepared to do before they get nuclear weapons."North Korea announced a "successful test" of a Hwasong-15 ICBM to demonstrate the rogue state had reached full nuclear capability.

    The missile is claimed to be capable of reaching the continental US and potentially has nuclear capability.North Korea's test comes a week after US President Donald Trump announced Pyongyang would be re-included to the US list of countries sponsoring terrorism – a move which will allow the United States to impose more sanctions on the isolationist country.President Trump repeatedly said that all options, including military ones, are on the table in dealing with North Korea while stressing its desire for a peaceful solution.US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said: "Diplomatic options remain viable and open, for now."He hower said that "the international community must take additional measures to enhance maritime security, including the right to interdict maritime traffic."
