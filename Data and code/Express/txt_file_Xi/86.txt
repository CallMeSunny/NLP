   The emerging superpower was “the world’s biggest risk this year,” according to analysis carried out by the Eurasia Group.It said that China’s 19th party congress “marked a turning point in China’s contemporary history” and warned the speech by President Xi Jinping would “eventually be recognised as the most geopolitically noteworthy event since Mikhail Gorbachev formally dissolved the Soviet Union”.The think tank added China was starting to fill the “power vacuum” left by US President Donald Trump who had turned his back on Washington-led multilateralism.The authors of the analysis, Ian Bremmer and Cliff Kupchan, said the world was in a “moment of global reordering” with China having its strongest leader since Mao Zedong and America “one of the weakest US presidents in modern history”.  GettyXi Jinping meets US President Donald TrumpChina posed a threat in three areas, the authors said.The “global business environment” would completely change and have to adapt to “a whole new set of rules, standards and practices pushed by China,” which would raise the cost of doing business.It added that China’s economic and political influence were “becoming dominant”.The authors expected increased “pushback” against China’s expansion which would lead to a more polarised Asia.The analysis stated: “Asia's largest and most developed countries — Japan, India, Australia, and to a lesser extent South Korea - will see Xi's agenda as a threat to their democratic-capitalist model.” Related articles   China's Xi Jinping may become 'as powerful as Chairman Mao'   China’s Xi Jinping unveils plans to be BIGGER than Trump   Donald Trump's Asia tour in pictures Mon, November 13, 2017Donald Trump and Melania Trump embark on a 12-day trip to five different Asian nations which are Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines Play slideshow  REUTERS1 of 100Thailand's PM Prayut Chan-o-Cha, Vietnam's PM Nguyen Xuan Phuc, U.S. President Trump, Philippine's President Rodrigo Duterte and Singapore's PM Lee Hsien Loong pose for a family photo during the ASEAN-US 40th Anniversary commemorative Summit in Manila

    The greatest areas of friction would be in the South China Sea, the situation with North Korea and over US-Chinese trade relations.The think tank also pointed to Xi’s “growing assertiveness”, saying that a risk was being created by the communist party’s control of the country’s private sector as well as inserting party controls at the top of private Chinese companies, as well as Chinese subsidiaries of foreign nationals.The authors stated those risks “could affect the long-term economic trajectory of both China and its imitators”.The report concluded: “Still, since 2008, we've seen a gradual erosion in global perceptions of the attractiveness of Western liberal democracies.“There is now a viable alternative. For most of the West, China is not an appealing substitute.“But for most everybody else, it is a plausible alternative. And with Xi ready and willing to offer that alternative and extend China's influence, that's the world's biggest risk this year.”
