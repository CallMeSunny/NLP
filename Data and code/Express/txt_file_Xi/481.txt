The indebted nation has a nominal GDP of €1.89 trillion in 2018, indicating a deficit goal of roughly €45 billion.Moody’s said in a statement: “That makes Italy vulnerable to future domestic or externally-sourced shocks, in particular to weaker economic growth.”Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Monday that the Italian government was ready to discuss its budget targets with European Union authorities.The Italian government is expected to send a letter on its budget to the Commission by noon.European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the European Commission would meet on Tuesday to discuss the response, adding that he could not say when it would take a decision.He said: ”When you are an EU member and a member of the single currency, of the euro zone, you must respect a number of joint rules.”
