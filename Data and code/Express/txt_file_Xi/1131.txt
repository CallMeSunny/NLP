  GETTY Song Tao reportedly praised China's friendship with North Korea Despite soaring tensions on the Korean peninsula over North Korea's growing nuclear capabilities, China - which the US thought was poised to help the crisis - neglected to mention Kim's missile tests during a recent meeting. Song Tao, the special envoy of Chinese President Xi Jinping, seemingly turned a blind eye to Kim Jong-un’s repeated threats of nuclear war in a move set to enrage Washington. It comes after Mr Tao reportedly delivered a gift to the depraved regime shortly after US President Donald Trump visited Beijing. China’s latest move flies in the face of promises it made to Mr Trump that Beijing will increase pressure on the rogue nation to halt its nuclear weapons programme.

    Washington had hoped North Korea would face increasing pressure to put an end to their nuclear test thanks to his recent visit to key allies in Asia.Mr Song arrived in Pyongyang on Friday but it is not clear how long he will be in North Korea. The last time China's special envoy for North Korea visited the country was in February last year.The influential state-run Chinese tabloid the Global Times said it was unwise to expect too much from the American leader’s Asia trip, saying his key mission was to inform North Korea about the party congress in Beijing.   The newspaper said: "Song is not a magician. The key to easing the situation on the peninsula lies in the hands of Washington and Pyongyang. "If both sides insist on their own logic and refuse to move in the same direction, even if Song opens a door for talks, the door could be closed any time."North Korea has been internationally condemned for pushing ahead with nuclear weapons testing despite swathes of US-backed sanctions being implemented on the hermit nation.Despot leader Kim and Mr Trump came entangled in a vicious war of words, threatening to destroy one another with their own nuclear arsenals, sparking fears of World War 3.  GETTY China appears to have gone back on its promise to intervene Mr Trump used his five-country tour of Asia to encourage leaders in the region to join him in pressuring North Korea into completely ditching its nuclear projects.China, normally a close economic ally of North Korea, agreed to send an envoy to the hermit nation to encourage Kim Jong-un to end his nuclear ambitions.
