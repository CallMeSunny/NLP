  China says it has called on North Korea to secure the release of a fishing boat and its crewKim Jong Un’s regime fired a projectile into waters off its eastern coast between 11 a.m. and noon today, South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min Seok said in Seoul.North Korea said today its rocket tests are part of drills to bolster deterrence against what it calls U.S. and South Korean "threats" to attack the North.Earlier, in the latest irritant in relations between the neighboring allies, China issued a warning to North Korea after a Chinese boat owner says his ship was seized by gun-toting North Koreans and held for ransom. The seizure of the Liaoning-based boat adds to China's frustration with North Korea over its recent tests of nuclear and rocket technologies in defiance of international efforts to curb the country's nuclear ambitions.At the same time, the Chinese government is under intense pressure domestically to ensure the safety of citizens who venture abroad or out to sea to seek their livelihoods. Another abduction by North Koreans of Chinese fishermen about a year ago - along with allegations they were beaten - sparked furious criticism among citizens in China's blogosphere."Whatever you call North Korea - rogue state or whatever - these kind of cases just keep happening," said a Liaoning Maritime and Fishery Administration official. "We had such cases last year and the year before. There's very little we can do to prevent them."China is North Korea's economic lifeline, providing nearly all of its fuel and most of its trade. North Korea's economic dependence on China is rising, following a standoff with South Korea that effectively shut an industrial park that was an important source of hard currency. Still, Beijing has had difficulty controlling its neighbor, and early this year began joining Western nations in moves to punish Pyongyang with economic sanctions.Meanwhile, the North has ignored calls for restraint from Western powers and appears to have acted after months of bellicose rhetoric, firing a short-range missile from its east coast yesterday – just a day after launching three other missiles, a South Korean news agency said.The North has issued  warnings of impending nuclear war North Korea  has ignored calls for restraint from Western powersLaunches by the North of short-range missiles are not uncommon but, after recent warnings from the communist state of impending nuclear war, such actions have raised concerns about the region's security."North Korea fired a short-range missile as it did yesterday into its east sea in the afternoon, " a South Korean news agency reported, citing a military official.U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he was concerned about North Korea's "provocative action", urging Pyonyang to refrain from further launches and return to stalled nuclear talks with world powers.Tension on the Korean peninsula has subsided in the past month, having run high for several weeks after the United Nations Security Council imposed tougher sanctions against Pyongyang following its third nuclear test in February.The North had for weeks issued nearly daily warnings of impending nuclear war with the South and the United States.South Korea's Unification Ministry criticized the missile tests as deplorable and urged the North to lower tensions and hold talks over a suspended inter-Korean industrial park in the North's border city of Kaesong.South Korea pulled out all of its workers from the industrial zone early this month after North Korea withdrew its 53,000 workers as tensions mounted.
