   North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un and President Donald Trump have agreed that they will meet, which is expected in May.Donald Trump last week however gloated of a “strong card” he holds in trade talks with South Korea, and may hold off a future agreement until a deal is reached with North Korean on denuclearisation.He said: “Just this week we secured a wonderful deal with South Korea. We were in a deal that was a horror show.“It was going to produce 200,000 jobs, and it did, for them. That was a Hillary Clinton special, I hate to say.  AP•GETTYNorth Korea news: Donald Trump sent North Korean leader Kim Jong-un a HUGE warning“‘This will produce 200,000 jobs’ and she was right, but it was for them it wasn’t for us. So we have re-done it and that is going to level the playing field on steel and cars and trucks coming into this country.“And I may hold it up till after a deal is made with North Korea. Does everybody understand that? Do you know why? Because it is a very strong card ad I want to make sure that everyone is treated fairly and we are moving along very nicely with North Korea.“We will see what happens. Certainly the rhetoric has calmed down just a little bit, wouldn’t you say? We will see how it all turns out and maybe it will be good and maybe it won’t.”President Trump then warned Kim Jong-un that if his terms are not met in talks with North Korea the US will simply walk away from the table, ramping up World War 3 fears.    Does everybody understand that? Do you know why? Because it is a very strong cardDonald TrumpHe said: “If it’s no good we are walking and if it’s good we will embrace it but it is going to be very interesting over the next period of time and South Korea has been wonderful.”President Trump was speaking in Ohio last Thursday when he made the warning to South and North Korea.North Korea experts have suggested Kim Jong-un is simply using talks with President Trump to try to drive a wedge between the US and South Korea.It comes after South Korea and North Korea agreed to hold a summit which will be their first in more than 10 years on April 27.The summit will take place at the border truce village of Panmunjom.
