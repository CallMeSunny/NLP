   Warplane pilots and crew in China have been told to be “combat ready all the time” after a fleet of jets flew over the South China Sea.Bombers with the ability to carry nuclear arms flew over the disputed region on Thursday as China continues to clash with the US.China’s military boasted that the flyover proved they could breach the disputed “First Island Chain.”Chinese officials failed to confirm how many planes were involved in the drill, however, the planes can fly at speeds of up to 656mph.China currently has 15 of these planes in service since they were deployed in 2009.

    US warships, including the aircraft carriers USS Ronald Reagan, USS Nimitz and USS Theodore Roosevelt are currently on exercise in the region.Chinese military observer Li Jie said the drill was a display of Beijing’s new 24/7 doctrine following tensions in the region, reports SCMP.He said: "The PLA is stepping up joint operation combat training as President Xi Jinping ordered them to be combat-ready all the time.“The air patrol also aimed at showing the PLA air force is ready to join with the Navy in the high seas for all kinds of missions.

    “It was so sweeping that actually there was a lot of concern that Treasury didn’t have the people to enforce this.“What we are seeing now is the enforcement. We are going to see a number of announcements in the next couple of weeks with more individuals, shipping companies, vessels being sanctions.“We are also getting to see they are having an effect, that North Korea is starting to run out of cash which is really good news.”
