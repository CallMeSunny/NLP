   EU officials are preparing to hold a special Brexit on April 10 in order to give Theresa May one final opportunity to request a lengthy Article 50 extension. But if the Prime Minister refuses to extend Britain’s stay in the bloc, leaders will use the talks to consolidate their no-deal Brexit plans. The emergency talks will be attached to an EU-China summit on April 9 when EU presidents Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk host Chinese president Xi Jinping in the Belgian capital.
