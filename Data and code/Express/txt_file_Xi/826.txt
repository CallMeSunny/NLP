   Amid rising tensions between the hermit country and the US, the infamous Seal Team 6 has been taking part in the Foal Eagle and Key Resolve exercise being carried out from March 7 to April 30 in South Korea.The team is taking part in a drill which simulates the “removal” of North Korea's dictator Kim Jong-un, the south’s JoongAng Daily said.The US military refused to confirm reports the squad, which killed Al Qaeda chief bin Laden in 2011, is in the region, but said “ground, air, naval and special operations” are taking part in “several joint and combined field training operations”.
