    “Already we are being overtaken by other events and crises that can be seen as greater and more immediate threats,” he said.“But in reality many are already and will increasingly be related to the rapidly growing effects of climate change.“On an increasingly crowded planet, humanity faces many threats - but none is greater than climate change.“It magnifies every hazard and tension of our existence.“It threatens our ability to feed ourselves; to remain healthy and safe from extreme weather; to manage the natural resources that support our economies and to avert the humanitarian disaster of mass migration and increasing conflict.”    Related articles   GLOBAL COOLING: Decade long ice age predicted as sun 'hibernates'   GLOBAL WARMING?

Charles went on to highlight how one trillion dollars are used to subsidise energy and good but that the money could be better used.“Just imagine what could be done if those vast sums supported sustainable energy, farming and fishing, rather than fossil fuels, deforestation and over-exploitation of the seas,” he added.COP 21 will see negotiators from 195 countries trying to forge a deal to prevent global temperatures rising more than 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels to stave off dangerous climate change.On its first day, Presidents Obama and Xi – leaders of two of the most powerful industrial nations and polluters – promised to work together to get a “low carbon global economy” this century.   “As the two largest economies in the world and the two largest carbon emitters, we have both determined that it is our responsibility to take action,” Obama said, with Xi sitting next to him. “Our leadership on this issue has been absolutely vital.”Xi said the two countries would work side by side to ensure the Paris conference achieved its goals, adding:“The world economy is recovering slowly, terrorism is on the rise and climate change is a huge challenge. There is more instability and uncertainty in the international situation.”
