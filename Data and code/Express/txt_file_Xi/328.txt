 Daniel Russel, former US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said the superpowers’ response to the rogue nation was “very disappointing”.China’s president Xi Jinping urged Donald Trump to show restraint towards North Korea in a phone call earlier this year despite growing alarm over the murderous regime’s nuclear plans.But Mr Trump has since warned of a “severe” punishment for the North Korean leader following the country’s intercontinental ballistic missile test.Speaking on the Today programme, on BBC Radio 4, Mr Russel said: “The initial response by both Russia and China coming out of the summit being held in Moscow at the time of the test was very disappointing.
