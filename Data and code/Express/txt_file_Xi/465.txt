   Speaking to a group of US investors and lobbyists in Beijing, Zhang Qingli, a government official leading a committee which is trying to forge business relations with foreign markets, said China is against the ongoing trade war with the US but warned his country won’t back down.Mr Qingli accused President Donald Trump of being responsible for waging the trade war and disregarding Chinese efforts to diffuse the situation.He went on to insist the Chinese government is ready to impose retaliatory measures to combat perceived aggressive American trade tactics.He said: "China never wants a trade war with anybody, not to mention the US, who has been a long term strategic partner, but we also do not fear such a war.
