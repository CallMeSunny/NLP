    Territories in the South China Sea are contested between China in addition to smaller states such as Vietnam, Taiwan, Cambodia, Brunei and the Philippines.The flyover by the highly-capable B-52 bombers came after US Defence Secretary James Mattis blasted Xi Jinping for his militarisation of the South China Sea last week.He said: "Despite China's claims to the contrary, the placement of these weapons systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion.”Mr Mattis stated such moves from Beijing call into question Xi Jinping’s “broader goals” as tensions continue to skyrocket between the two nations.   He went on: "China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes.“It calls into question China's broader goals.”Fears of World War 3 continued to soar after the Defence Secretary declared America has plans to stay “in the Indo-Pacific” as part of a move that will surely enrage Beijing.The war of words between Beijing and Washington comes during a time both nations are battering each other with tariffs as part of a £75billion trade war.
