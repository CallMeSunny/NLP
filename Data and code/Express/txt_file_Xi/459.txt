  REUTERSIranian President Hassan Rouhani (L) shakes hands with Chinese President Xi JinpingBeijing announced it would be deepening economic engagements with Iran by imposing 17 agreements for cooperation.It comes just a week after international sanctions were lifted against the country causing oil to flood the markets.In June 2014 oil was trading at more than $100 a barrel, in recent days it has dropped below $30 and some experts say it could go as low as $10.The drop has led to increased tensions between Saudi Arabia, previously the world's leading supplier of oil, and Iran.Russia and America's policy of fracking have also upped the amount of oil flooding the market, exacerbating the oversupply.Xi Jinping during his visit to Tehran said the 17 agreements covered the areas of energy, trade and industry.The two countries also agreed to increase bilateral trade which could amount to $600 billion over the next decade.

While the tension is unlikely to escalate into direct military confrontation, its repercussions are already being felt in the proxy wars fought by Iran and Saudi Arabia, mainly in Syria and Yemen."Marc Pierini, a scholar at global think tank, Carnegie Europe said: "A war between Iran and Saudi Arabia is indeed a possibility, but it is probably not the most imminent threat resulting from the acute crisis between the two countries."The real game changer in the Middle East in 2015 was the deal between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany on Tehran’s nuclear research programme."
