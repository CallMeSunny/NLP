  GETTYPresident Xi Jinping has called Donald Trump over what China claimed was aggressionMilitary jets were scrambled to the USS Stethem while Chinese leader Xi Jinping called US President Donald Trump.The nation has vowed to step up patrols by air and sea while Mr Xi said there are a number of “negative factors” disrupting relations between the two nations.On Sunday the USS Stethem came within 12 nautical miles of Triton Island which is claimed by China, Taiwan and Vietnam.Ever since his ascension to the White House Mr Trump has refused to steer clear of political tangles in the region.The President even agreed a $1.3billion arms sale in Taiwan, which is viewed as a renegade province of China.

    China has attempted to keep the role as peacemaker by introducing financial and trade sanctions on North Korea, but Mr Trump is calling for it to do more.After the launch of another ballistic missile, which likely hit Japanese waters, Mr Trump tweeted: “Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!”Just one month ago the two nations agreed to find a lasting solution to the chaos coming from North Korea.However, analysts have claimed Mr Trump is being put off the relationship by China’s failure to reign in neighbouring dictator Kim Jong-Un.
