    The letter was revealed by the Pyongyang-based news agency KCNA - a source which regularly issues bizarre and distorted editorials but can be relied on to accurately print foreign correspondence. The letter from President Xi expressed gratitude for the despot’s congratulations and promised a closer partnership in the future. President Xi said: “I express sincere thanks for respectively sending congratulatory messages as regards the facts that the 19th National Congress of the CPC was held and I was elected general secretary of the Central Committee, the CPC, and took office as chairman of the Central Military Commission again some days ago.”The Chinese leader focused on economic development, “defending regional peace” and prosperity.He said: “I wish that under the new situation the Chinese side would make efforts with the DPRK side to promote the relations between the two parities and the two countries to sustainable soundness and stable development and thus make a positive contribution to providing the peoples of the two countries with more wonderful happiness and defending regional peace and stability and common prosperity.

We have so devotedly helped the Chinese revolution and suffered enormous damage."READ MORE: Who are North Korea's allies?
