And Beijing’s increased presence poses a threat to future trade in the region, Admiral Davidson said. But despite China’s strategy, he said the US is committed to remaining an “enduring Pacific power”, Bloomberg reports.

South China Sea: Tensions ERUPT as US bombers DEFY Chinese The South China Sea is home to some of the world’s most important shipping lanes, with an estimated £4 trillion worth of trade passing through the region annually.But Western nations, particular the US, fear China’s claim could see Beijing seek to control trade vessels passing through its waters.Admiral Davidson said: “It’s a hazard to trade flows, the commercial activity, the financial information that flows on cables under the South China Sea, writ large.”The warning comes after a top Republican senator this week warned Chinese leader Xi Jinping is risking a military clash through “aggressive actions” in the regions international shipping lanes.  The US fears China could use its claims to disrupt trade through the South China Sea (Image: GETTY IMAGES)Tom Cotton, a member of the Armed Services Committee, told the Washington Examiner: “The United States wants ‘a shooting war’ with no nation.“In that region in particular, the only nation that risks that kind of military action is China, through aggressive actions in the South China Sea or towards Taiwan, or some of its other neighbours.”Last month, a leading UK think tank warned Britain must be prepared to face down an increasingly aggressive China to protect its interests in the heavily militarised South China Sea.   Research by the Henry Jackson Society said nearly £100billion of trade to and from the UK passes through the region annually.And the best way to help maintain freedom of navigation for vessels in the area is to deploy Royal Navy warships, the study concluded - despite the risk of “inadvertent escalation” with Chinese vessels.
