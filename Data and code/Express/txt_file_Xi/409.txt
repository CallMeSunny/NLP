   The results are likely to trigger significant changes in how the US President can meet his domestic goals, but they are unlikely to provide relief for global superpowers he is engaged in trade disputes with.Experts have warned Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ philosophy, - the nation’s foreign policy emphasising its nationalism in rejection of international policies - will not deviate from its current course, even with the Democrats winning the House of Representatives.As results throughout the US begin to flood in from the midterm elections, Steven Okun, senior advisor at McLarty Associates, issued a stark warning for China when speaking to United States news broadcaster CNBC.Read more: Midterm elections 2018 results LIVE Related articles   Midterm elections: Why Trump trade wars with China WON’T affect vote   US-China trade war: Xi Jinping in SLY DIG at Donald Trump  He said: “On trade, it’s going to be the same, if not worse, in terms of US-China.”The President suffered a blow after the Democrats won the 218 seats needed to take control of the House, but the Republicans have expanded their majority in the Senate.Both of these chambers make up Congress - the country’s main decision-making body - and approval from each is needed to pass bills into law.This result leaves Mr Trump facing challenges on several critical areas such as military spending and his foreign business dealings, making it difficult for him to pass major legislation.But the US President will still enjoy significant executive power on areas such as trade policy, and is able to set the terms regardless of whether Congress is divided or not.RBC Capital Markets analysts explained in a recent note this is because “Congress does’t have much of an ability to control trade policy”.

"President Xi said: “It is a concrete action taken by China to advance an open world economy and support economic globalisation.”
