    A tit-for-tat trade war between the two economic superpowers has been developing for some time - and could jeopardise growth in global markets.Donald Trump has also warned the European Union they too could face tariffs if they do not open up their market.The EU is famously protectionist, ratcheting up tariffs against often less prosperous non-EU countries.Prime Minister Theresa May has tried to use her influence to oppose the erection of trade barriers in Europe and America, as has Trade Secretary Liam Fox.
