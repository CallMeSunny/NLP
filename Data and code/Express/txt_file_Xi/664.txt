   Admiral Scott Swift, Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, said China’s “intent is not clearly understood”.He made his comments after China unveiled an 8.1 percent rise to £125billion (1.1trillion yuan) in defence spending for 2018 amid ambitious modernisation plans for the military.During a press roundtable in Tokyo, Japan, today Admiral Swift said: “These investments and commitment need to be taken with full transparency."There are a lot of questions on the minds of countries in the region and extending beyond the region of what exactly does this mean.

GETTYAdmiral Swift raised concerns about China's military spendingThe China Daily said: "China's defence budget is neither the largest in size - it accounts for just one-fourth of the military spending of the United States - nor does it have the fastest growth rate."And if calculated in per capita terms, China's military lags well behind other major countries."Speaking at the opening of China’s 13th National People’s Congress, Premier Li Keqiang said China will “advance all aspects of military training and war preparedness, and firmly and resolvedly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests”.The nation has the world’s largest military by number of troops, but Mr Li said the country had “basically completed” its target of reducing the size of the armed forces by 300,000 troops.  GETTYPresident Xi Jinping promised last year to make China's armed forces a “world-class force” That would leave the People’s Liberation Army’s strength at around two million troops.Neighbouring Japan and Taiwan are said to be nervous about the spending hike but the Chinese Communist Party insists it poses no threat to other countries.China has made no secret of its broader military ambitions, with President Xi Jinping promising last year to make China's armed forces a “world-class force” by the middle of the century.The country is developing new military capabilities including stealth fighters, electromagnetic railguns, aircraft carriers and anti-satellite missiles.
