   The US and China have slapped import taxes each other in an escalating trade war.Despite a brief respite in May following a visit to Washington by Vice Premier Liu He, the top economic adviser to Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping, tax increases continue to be implemented.The latest of these exchanges was in September, with the US announcing a 10 percent tariff on $200billion (£153bn) worth of Chinese goods, which would increase to 25 percent by the end of 2018.The US simultaneously threatened to add tariffs to a further $267billion (£205bn) if China retaliated, which it did with 10 percent tariffs on $60billion (£46bn) of US imports on September 18.

As this back and forth between the two countries continues, what implications will this have should an agreement fail to materialise?Speaking to Express.co.uk, Tony Hughes, CEO at global skills development company, Huthwaite International, said: “The trade war between the United States and China has escalated once again with both sides announcing their biggest waves of punitive tariffs yet.“The two superpowers have imposed export rates on more than $360 billion of manufactured goods and commodities and analysts are predicting the battle is far from over.“The clash between the world’s top two economies is already hurting businesses on both sides of the Pacific and the latest US move means roughly half of the products that China sells to the US each year will be hit by American tariffs.”  Donald Trump and Xin Jinping are at war over trade (Image: GETTY)American multinational investment bank and financial services company Morgan Stanley has said a full-blown escalation of the trade dispute could decrease global gross domestic product by 0.81 percentage points.Car manufacturers have also been affected, with Ford and General Motors lowering profit forecasts for 2018, blaming higher steel and aluminium prices imposed by the new US tariffs.Ludovic Subran, chief economist at Euler Hermes told express.co.uk, “Global trade growth could halve by 2020 should the US and China fail to agree a deal to halt the increase in import tariffs.“The US has implemented a 10 percent tariff on $200bn (£153bn) of Chinese imports. China has retaliated with tariffs on $60bn (£46bn) of goods starting later this month.WHY IS THE US PRESIDENT BEING CONDEMNED BY FELLOW REPUBLICANS?

Donald Trump's administration continues to implement tariff hikes (Image: GETTY)Mr Focas said: “So far, markets appear to be holding up to Trump's trade tariffs on China. But this probably more down the fact that many investors would have already priced in the tariffs.“No country is safe from Trump.“While the President has yet to officially slap tariffs on the likes of Germany, his protectionist rhetoric alone has created uncertainty across the German economy and more broadly across European financial markets."“Until counter tariffs are enforced on the U.S, it is too early to say who the winners and losers will be.“History tells us that protectionist policies from one country has a negative effect on everyone involved.”
