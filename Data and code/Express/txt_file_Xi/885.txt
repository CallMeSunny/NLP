Zhang Junshe, a researcher at China's PLA Naval Military Studies Research Institute, said: "Both countries warships definitely have to come into close proximity and it's easy for there to be a misunderstanding or an error of judgement, even a collision. And if there is a collision, the root cause is the United States."
