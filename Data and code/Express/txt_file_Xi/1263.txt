  GETTY / PATheresa May is set to confirm plans for a new nuclear power stationThe Prime Minister has confirmed Hinkley Point C will proceed after a "revised agreement" was reached with EDF.A Downing Street spokesperson said: “Following a comprehensive review of the Hinkley Point C project the government has decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation.“However, ministers will impose a new legal framework for future foreign investment in Britain’s critical infrastructure, which will include nuclear energy and apply after Hinkley.”The announcement ends weeks of speculation over the Hinkley Point's future after Mrs May ordered a review into the project amid concerns over China's involvement.The new deal ensures that EDF remain the "principle operator" and contains guarantees that the French-owned energy firm won't "dispose of their stake without government consent".

It will be the first new plant of its kind since Sizewell B was commissioned in Suffolk in 1995.The £18billion project would be the biggest building site in Europe and would create 25,000 new jobs during construction. The finished plant would employ 900 people.EDF – which is mostly owned by the French government – will finance the majority of the project, with China fronting one-third of the cost.  GETTYThe new plant will be built next to two existing reactorsThe Government have guaranteed EDF a strike price of £92.50 for every megawatt hour of power produced for 35 years as an incentive to build the station.This is more than double the current wholesale price of electricity. Customers will be forced to pay well over the odds to meet the inflated figure.EDF plans to follow Hinkley Point C with another Sizewall project, which the Chinese are entitled to take a stake in. Once completed, the strike price for both plants would fall to £89.50.   Why did Theresa May delay her decision on Hinkley Point C?The delay in July came just days before EDF directors were due to sign contracts with the government. It sparked outrage among Chinese leaders.Ambassador Liu Xiaoming said that the two nations were at a “crucial historical juncture” and warned that Hinkley point’s failure could damage UK-China relations.But Mrs May said: "Our relationship with China is about more than Hinkley." A Downing Street spokesperson confirmed President Xi Jinping "had the patience to wait for a resolution".

    Mrs May is said to have been worried that China’s involvement in the project posed a security threat.Nick Timothy, her joint chief of staff, said: "Security experts - reportedly inside as well as outside government - are worried that the Chinese could use their role to build weaknesses into computer systems which will allow them to shut down Britain's energy production at will.”The Prime Minister is also said to have been concerned about former chancellor George Osborne’s “gung-ho approach to Chinese investment”.WHAT IS THE G20?  PAHinkley Point C is on hold while Mrs May reviews the Chinese involvementWhy does the Government say we need new nuclear stations?Ever since Tony Blair was in office, successive governments have argued that Britain needs new nuclear power stations to meet increasing electricity demand.Once commissioned, Hinkley Point C will deliver 7% of the UK’s power, making us less reliant on imported energy and fossil fuels.Supporters of nuclear power argue that it is more reliable than renewable energy such as wind and solar power which depend on weather.But environmentalists oppose nuclear power due to concerns over radioactive waste, safety dangers and risks to the environment. What is the Chinese involvement in Hinkley Point C?The Chinese, via the CGN group, have committed to providing one-third of the £18billion construction cost.The deal also gives them a stake in two further proposed nuclear power stations – Sizewell C in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex.
