   North Korea could see its destructive rhetoric destroyed as China agrees to ramp up economic pressure on the volatile country.Mr Burns, who served as the US diplomatic liaison to NATO, said: "We have seen some decisive steps by China of a type they hadn’t taken before. That is encouraging and it’s what makes this visit by President Trump to Bejing so important at this stage of the North Korean crisis."Combined with the President’s speech in Seoul you can just feel the pressure ratcheting down just a little bit as diplomacy becomes more the centrepiece."The former ambassador praised President Donald Trump for convincing his Chinese counterpart that further pressure on North Korea would be beneficial to China.  TIME/SKY NEWS/CBSNChina has adopted heavy economic sanctions on North Korea to influence its nuclear rhetoricSpeaking to BBC News, Mr Burns said: "I think you have to grant to President Trump that he’s been able to work with Xi Jinping to convince the Chinese that it’s in their interest to increase Chinese economic pressure on North Korea."Mr Trump is currently on a two-day visit to China as part of his tour of four major Asian countries.North Korea has ignored international condemnation and continues its efforts to push forward and create a deadly arsenal of nuclear weapons, sparking fears of World War 3.Mr Trump branded North Korea a “menace threatening the world with nuclear devastation” during his latest speech in Seoul.    You can just feel the pressure ratcheting down just a little bit as diplomacy becomes more the centrepieceNicholas BurnsMr Trump attacked despot leader Kim Jong-un's regime and called on "all responsible nations" to unite to halt the nuclear threat from the rogue state.But South Korean foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha warned North Korea could be on its way to strike against the US after resolving technical issues in its missile arsenal.She said: "They are using this lull to fine-tune some technical aspects of what further provocation they might undertake."Further provocations are always possible and so we are watching very closely. But certainly, this period of lull gives us an indication that North Korea is also recalculating."

    Experts fear Kim could make his biggest statement yet by firing the so-called “Juche bird” – a fearful H-bomb – during Mr Trump’s visit to Asia.North Korea frequently arranges its missile tests to coincide with major international meetings and the US President’s visit could be the perfect opportunity for the rogue state.Joshua Pollack of RUSI said North Korea could fire the weapon in a desperate show of force against the US and its allies.Mr Pollack said: "North Korean leadership undoubtedly feels pushed into a corner."The logical sequence of actions would be to start testing them to full range into the Pacific and then to use one for a live nuclear test if it is deemed necessary to convince America’s leaders that a new reality has emerged.
