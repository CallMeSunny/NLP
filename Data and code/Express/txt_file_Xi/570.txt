    The statements from the two officials come after the hermit kingdom launched their most powerful missile yet, this week.The test marks a significant step forward for the Kim regime, putting the entirety of mainland US and Britain within range.Nuclear experts have said North Korea has yet to deliver a nuclear warhead on top of an ICBM, but it is likely this will happen soon.   The first images of the missile launch were released last night - despot leader Kim Jong-un can be seen watching the deadly projectile as it entered the stratosphere before plunging into the Sea of Japan.The rogue nation’s latest missile is more advanced compared to the Hwasong-14 which North Korea tested back in July from an undisclosed location.The main threat for the West is whether the missile can carry a large nuclear warhead far enough to strike the United States.North Korea’s state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) claimed that the Hwasong-15 was "tipped with super-large heavy warhead which is capable of striking the whole mainland of the US”.With China being the only country propping up the North Korean economy, it appears that Beijing and Xi Jinping could be the key to diffusing World War 3 tensions.Oliver North, a former US Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel, warned China to step in and resolve the issue before a conflict breaks out.The political commentator told Fox News that Donald Trump would offer a “devastating response” to any genuine North Korean aggression.He added that China would have the most to lose in the event of a war breaking out in the region.Lt. Col. North said: “There is no doubt that China has all the cards in this.“It’s important for President Xi to understand that this is not only an existential threat to the United States. It is an existential threat to the whole world.“If the North Koreans launch something that is aimed in this direction with a warhead on it, there will be a devastating response.”The commentator predicted China being swamped by tens of millions of refugees as innocent bystanders attempt to flee the carnage of war.  GETTYBeijing and Xi Jinping could be the key to diffusing World War 3 tensions“You’re talking somewhere between five and ten million refugees,” he said.“Millions of people in boats totally disrupting the Chinese economy, and the Chinese are the ones who hold all the cards.”However, China has been listed alongside a group of states who could be helping North Korea create its deadly arsenal of nuclear weapons.  GETTYThe ambassador also revealed that Donald Trump recently spoke with Chinese leader Xi JinpingJohn Bolton a former US ambassador to the United Nations, warned of a series of “delinquent” states assisting North Korea’s efforts.He told Fox: “They’ve been buying technology from Russia, China. They are using basic Soviet-era scud missile technology. They’ve cooperated with Iran for many, many years.“There are a lot of delinquents out there that have helped the North Koreans get to this point, no doubt about it.”
