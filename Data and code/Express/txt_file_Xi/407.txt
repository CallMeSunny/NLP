   And it is feared the move could outrage tyrannical despot Kim Jong-Un who could launch a deadly nuclear strike at any time.South Korea and China have agreed to disagree in a bid to get relations back on track following a year-long standoff after the US installed an anti-missile system in South Korea.Beijing announced it would end the unofficial economic blockade against its neighbour - although officials said its position on the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system had not changed.South Korea’s foreign ministry said in a joint statement: “The two sides attached great importance to the Korea-China relationship and decided to push for the further development of the strategic co-operative partnership.” Related articles   North Korea nuclear disaster will spread radiation across the world   World War 3: China allows US anti-missiles shield in Korean peninsula The installation of the THAAD system enraged Chinese officials, who believe the platform’s powerful radar compromises its own missile deterrent.Authorities quickly responded by launching the year-long economic war against Seoul - forcing citizens to boycott South Korean companies.Chinese tour groups were also stopped from visiting South Korea and the consumer ban on brands such as Hyundai led to the collapse in sales in the car manufacturer’s largest market.But the two countries have agreed to relax the blockade in a bid for peace in the region.
