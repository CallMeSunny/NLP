   The Korean border’s demilitarised zone (DMZ), which divides the North and South, is seen as one option, especially as an inter-Korean summit is due to take place there next month.South Korean President Moon Jae-in is scheduled to meet Kim at the Panmunjom Peace House on the southern side of the heavily-fortified DMZ, making it a credible venue.If Kim does travel to meet President Trump it would be the first time he has left the country since becoming its supreme leader in 2011 following the death of his father Kim Jong-il.It seems unlikely the dictator would accept an invitation to visit Washington or President Trump’s estate in Florida, where President Xi Jinping of China has previously been a guest.
