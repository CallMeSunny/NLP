   Mr Trump throughout his campaigning for the presidency has repeatedly condemned China and the damage globalisation has had on the US economy.The President-elect has warned he will slap a 45 per cent tariff on Chinese imports once he takes office, an act that Martin Jacques believes will destabilise global relations to an historic level.Mr Jacques, author of When China Rules the World, told the Today programme on Radio 4: “I think this is a kind of extraordinary moment. Probably we are entering the most portentous period in global relations since 1945 with the US suddenly turning its back on everything it has really stood for and going it alone in a protectionist and nationalistic fashion.”He continued: “China has greatly benefited from globalisation and it is seeking to continue the value that have underpinned the liberal order since 1949 and that is the scene.”  GETTYDonald Trump and Chinese Premier Xi JinpingWhen asked how he believed China would react to Mr Trump following through and proposing the tariffs, Mr Jacques said the world’s second-largest economy would not stand aside.“It will be a trade war,” he said. “God forbid because I think the consequences for the global economy will be extremely serious.“We are looking at something closer to the experience of the 1930s.”During the interwar period, the US’ isolationist and protectionist policies saw huge tariffs imposed on imported goods into the US.Mr Jacques continued: “If the Americans put on big duties in a fairly arbitrary way, China reacts similar levels of tariffs on American goods and so on, and the result will be declining markets, declining trade.

    An editorial in the Global Times, a state-run newspaper, said China would continue to defend its rights.It said: “Tillerson had better bone up on nuclear power strategies if he wants to force a big nuclear power to withdraw from its own territories.“China has enough determination and strength to make sure that his rabble-rousing will not succeed… Unless Washington plans to wage a large-scale war in the South China Sea, any other approaches to prevent Chinese access to the islands will be foolish.”
