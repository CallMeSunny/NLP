  GETTYWould you travel to North Korea to watch the World Cup? Despite repeated missile threats, UN sanctions, a horrendous human rights record and a determination to remain detached from the international community, North Korea could share hosting duties under the new proposal. In a bid to improve ties between Pyongyang and Seoul, South Korea’s new president Moon Jae-in put forward the idea during a meeting with FIFA president Gianni Infantino during the recent Under-20 World Cup.

    The extraordinary proposal is the latest effort by South Korea’s new president to improve ties between the countries, which have come under increasing strain as the North ramps up its threat of missile attacks on its southern neighbour.The two nations currently sit either side of the world’s most heavily-fortified border since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty - meaning that technically the two countries are still at war.South Korea and Japan hosted the World Cup together in 2002 and are believed to be keen to hold the tournament again.North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has reportedly started following Italian football after he saw the country’s star striker score for Serie A side Cagliari.  GETTYFIFA chief Infantino is believed to be considering the proposalAlmost all of the hermit state’s national team play for clubs in North Korea, given the difficulties of escaping the communist kingdom.North Korea have qualified just twice for the World Cup - once in 1966 and most recently in 2010, when they travelled to South Africa to take part.The North Korean team lost all three of their group stage games in 2010 and were subjected to a six-hour verbal attack in a public dressing down for "betraying" the communist nation's ideological struggle, according to reports.How fans and participants would travel to the hermit state is just one of a number of issues that would have to be considered before North Korea has any chance of hosting the famed tournament.There are already concerns about the hosts of the next two World Cups - Russia and Qatar - over the dangers posed to travelling fans.Russian hooligans caused chaos at the Euro 2016 tournament in France as they fought with rival fans on multiple occasions.
