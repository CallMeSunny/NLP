    Speaking alongside Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at a joint press conference on Wednesday, Mr Trump reiterated his plans to tackle the North Korea tensions without China if necessary.He said: "President Xi wants to do the right thing. We had a very good bonding, I think we had a very good chemistry together, I think he wants to help us with North Korea."We talked trade, we talked a lot of things, and I said the way you’re going to make a good trade deal is to help us with North Korea, otherwise we’re just going to go it alone, that’ll be all right too, but going it alone means going with lots of other nations."
