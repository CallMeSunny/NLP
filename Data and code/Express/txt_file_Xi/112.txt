Mr Tiankai warned the US President’s headstrong team that “dire consequences” will take place if they stand in the way of the Chinese premier. Washington is however open to reaching a deal with Beijing, with White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow saying the US President is expecting this to take place over a dinner on Saturday. But at that same dinner he has warned Mr Trump will hike tariffs on US exports should he not get the deal he wants.   Mr Kudlow said Mr Trump told his advisers that “in his view, there is a good possibility that a deal can be made, and that he is open to that”.The White House economic adviser did not comment on whether China had made offers of concessions, further feeling suspicions of a trade stand-off between the pair.He added the high-stakes dinner would be a prime opportunity for the two leaders to “turn the page” and put an end to the dispute on intellectual property, technology transfer, ownership of American companies in China, high tariffs and non-tariff barriers on commodities, and commercial hacking which will all be debated as “conditions to be met”.
