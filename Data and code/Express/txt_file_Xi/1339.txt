  Chinese President Xi Jinping shakes hands with scientists over the moon mission [EPA]The money - £27million - was revealed by the Department for International Development (Dfid) and left the UK last year.Around £5million was invested in Chinese companies as opposed to given in aid, but that still leaves £22million handed over by the Foreign Office.In 2011, China was one of 16 countries which the then-International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell vowed would stop receiving UK aid by 2016.China celebrated at the weekend when it successfully landed a space probe on the moon, taking the Asian super-power one step closer to putting a man on the lunar surface. Conservative MP Peter Bone called on International Development Secretary Justine Greening to explain why UK money was still going to China."The public will be rightly horrified that we are still wasting money on aid to China,' he told the Daily Mail."It's extraordinary that we are doing this while they send a mission to the moon."If these aid programmes are still continuing then I think Justine Greening needs to come to Parliament and explain what the justification is, because I can't think of one."China's lunar probe [AP] Taxpayers expect UK aid to be helping people in the world's poorest nations.Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' AllianceThe £5million invested in Chinese companies came via the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC).That figure is just a fraction of the £71million committed by the CDC in 2008 for investment in Chinese businesses.There have been no new investment agreements since then, but as part of the agreement money is handed out over a number of years.While the balance sheet for CDC in 2012 carries a net loss of £5million in respect of its Chinese investments, a spokesman said the corporation would see a £30million return on the same portfolio by the end of this year.He said: "We aim to ensure that our investments ultimately generate a positive return and CDC will be able to reinvest those profits in the regions in which we now target for investment – Africa and South Asia. Since 2004, CDC has grown in value from £1billion to £2.8billion in 2012. As well as China, a further 14 countries due to have all funding cut off by 2016 received cash last year, adding up to a total of £131.9 million.These included Vietnam, which was given £51.5 million, Cambodia £14.5 million, Indonesia £11.3 million and Kosovo £10.2 million. Russia did not receive any aid.Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: "Taxpayers expect UK aid to be helping people in the world's poorest nations."A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: "Since 2011, we have stopped or are in the process of stopping bilateral aid to over a dozen countries that are becoming more prosperous like China and Russia. "This has allowed us to concentrate our efforts where the need is greatest and where we can have most impact. "It is right that where these programmes have closed that Her Majesty's Government continues to work with non-governmental partners on global issues like sustaining economic growth and climate change which affect us all."Last year the Government announced it was to cut foreign aid to India by 2015 because of the country's growing economy, after repeatedly coming under fire for sending over an average of £280 million a year despite its multi-million space programme.
