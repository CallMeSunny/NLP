Chinese banks that deal with North Korea make money out of those interests.“One of the things that Americans are thinking about is possibly introducing secondary sanctions. In other words, North Korea has almost been sanctioned to the limit. “If you really want to put pressure on the North Koreans you’ve really got to get the third parties, who are working with the North Koreans, that includes Chinese banks.”Chinese president, Xi Jinping, is set to visit Trump’s Florida resort this week as the two leaders are expected to discuss the growing threat from Kim Jong Un’s nuclear programme.

     Trump doesn’t want to have to contemplate military actionJohn Nilsson-WrightPresident Trump has claimed that if China do not step up and apply pressure to North Korea then the US might possibly turn to military action.Mr Nilsson-Wright added that a war with North Korea would be “catastrophic” for the American President and insisted he will pressure China to do more. He added: “So I think what Mr Trump is trying to do is to warn the Chinese that this is in the offing, if China does not follow through and do something. “Trump of course wants China to do more, what he doesn’t want to have to do, even though he has been talking about it, is to contemplate military action.“The cost of that would be catastrophic.”
