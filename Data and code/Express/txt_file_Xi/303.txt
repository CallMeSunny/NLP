    Speaking at a news conference at the UN headquarters, Mr Liu said: “Currently tensions are high and we certainly would like to see a de-escalation."If tension only goes up ... then sooner or later it will get out of control and the consequences would be disastrous."The ambassador made the comments a day after China’s president Xi Jingling spoke with President Donald Trump to discuss the threat posed by Pyongyang.

The Chinese leader said “negative factors” have affected his relationship with President Trump.Pressing for more cooperative action against Kim, Mr Liu said, “we cannot afford to wait for too long without dialogue taking place” because the crisis with North Korea is “very, very serious”.

    A commentator can be heard in the video claiming Pyongyang will be able to “wipe out the daylight robbery U.S. imperialist and its subordinate [South Korea] without a trace”, according to NK news.Shortly before yesterday’s tests, Kim Jong-un’s mouthpiece criticised South Korea’s alliance with the US, claiming its neighbour is a “puppet and colonial servant”.The North Korean state newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, lashed out saying South Korean officials had ”revealed their miserable appearance seized with sycophancy and submission to the US”.
