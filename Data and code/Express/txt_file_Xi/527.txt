GettyTalks were held at the Kremlin over the situation in North KoreaThe statement said Washington was using North Korea as a pretext to expand its military infrastructure in Asia and risked upsetting the strategic balance of power in the area."The deployment ... of THAAD will cause serious harm to the strategic security interests of regional states, including Russia and China," the statement said."Russia and China oppose the deployment of such systems and call on the relevant countries to immediately halt and cancel the process of deployment."
