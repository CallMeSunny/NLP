    Teacher Ms Shakespeare explained: “I know that if Letisha wasn’t murdered I wouldn’t have taken the path I have taken. Everything I have done and will continuously do is for the kids. “I don’t do it for medals – my reward is when I can see that a child has turned their life around.” Ms Shakespeare went on to describe her work through charity Precious Lives as “a drop in the ocean” in what was the continuing problem of gun and knife crime. Letisha died alongside her cousin Charlene Ellis, 18.   GETTYA 17-year-old Army cadet,Jeremiah Emmanuel, was amongst those honouredThey were killed by a hail of machine gun bullets in the horrific incident in the early hours of January 2, 2003. Charlene’s twin sister Sophie and her cousin Cheryl Shaw were also hit, but they survived. All four were innocent victims caught in the cross-fire of a Birmingham gang feud. Four men were later jailed over the killings.
