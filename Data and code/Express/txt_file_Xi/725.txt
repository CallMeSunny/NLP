    Mr Hirson said on CNBC: "We're seeing some incremental steps that the Chinese may be in favour of doing more. I think China is signalling to both sides, to the US that China is doing more, that China is acting in good faith to head off a crisis in North Korea."Primarily they're telling the US that ultimately China feels the only solution in North Korea is one that involves diplomacy and getting North Korea to the table."But Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian, an assistant editor at Foreign Policy, maintained that China is and has always been careful in handling the situation of North Korean.Explaining the chaotic relationship between the two nations, Ms Allen Ebrahimian said: ”China fears that harsher sanctions may destabilise its northern neighbour, which could potentially send millions of refugees over the border.
