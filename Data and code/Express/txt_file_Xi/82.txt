   The octogenarian monarch, who has overseen the launch of an ambitious economic reform plan since his accession two years ago, is on a month-long Asian tour. The visits to countries that are some of world's fastest growing importers of Saudi oil aim to promote investment opportunities in the kingdom, including the sale of a stake in its giant state firm Saudi Aramco. Saudi Arabia has sought to boost oil sales to China, the world's second-largest oil market, after losing market share to Russia last year, by working mostly with China's top three state oil firms.   GETTYSaudi Arabia is looking to further boost its oil sales in China Related articles   EU countries selling MILLIONS of pounds of arms to Middle East   Transgender Pakistanis ‘beaten to death by Saudi Arabian police'  Chinese President Xi Jinping told Salman in Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People that his visit showed the importance he attached to relations with China. "This visit will push forward and continue to improve the quality of our relations and bear new fruit," President Xi said in comments in front of reporters. Deputy Chinese Foreign Minister Zhang Ming said the memorandums of understanding and letters of intent were potentially worth about $65 billion, involving everything from energy to space, but he did not give details.   GETTYXi Jinping said the visit would help the countries' relationship develop"President Xi Jinping and King Salman are old friends," Zhang said.

But it has been trying to get more involved in efforts to end Syria's six-year-old civil war, where Riyadh supports rebels battling President Bashar al-Assad. Last year China also offered support for Yemen's government, which is backed by a Saudi-led Gulf Arab coalition in a war against the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement that controls much of the country.   GETTYThe trade deals will be worth approximately $65billion Inside China's Military Superpower Sat, November 11, 2017An inside view of the Chinese military over 120 years.

    Zhang said both the Yemen and Syria crises were discussed by Salman and Xi, and both leaders agreed that these issues must be resolved politically via talks. China has had to tread a careful line, though, as it also has close relations with Iran. President Xi visited both Saudi Arabia and Iran in January last year.   GETTYXi Jinping also publicly supported Yemen's government in 2016Next week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits China. One Beijing-based diplomat from a Muslim-majority country told Reuters that China was trying to play the role of "honest broker" in the Middle East, as it lacks the historical baggage of the Americans or the Europeans. "China does not take sides and that is appreciated," said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
