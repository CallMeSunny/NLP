    China has continued to reject the claims as Beijing considers the waters of the South China Sea its national territory.Mr Pyne added: “Australia’s responsible for about 10 percent of the world’s surface into the Indian Ocean, the Pacific, down to Antarctica up into the South China Sea.”In addition to spying over the South China Sea, the drones will also be used to monitor vessels in Australian waters, including other countries’ naval vessels, watch out for illegal fishing activity. and people smuggling.The Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton has the same wingspan as a Boeing 737 and can remain airborne for over 30 hours a time.     The government’s plans are set to cost Australia more than double the original estimated price (Image: YOUTUBE)This will enable the aircraft enough time to monitor an area of around 40,000 square kilometres.The Sydney Morning Herald said: “The aircraft will easily be able to complete a lap of the South China Sea after taking off from the Northern Territory.”The Australian government expects to see the aircraft in service by 2023.While the full fleet is hoped to be in use by the end of 2025.The six Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton’s are set to join the Australian Air Force’s existing fleet of P-8A Poseidon aircrafts.  Australian Minister for the Defence Industry Christopher Pyne backed the investment (Image: YOUTUBE)A government statement said the new aircrafts will “undertake a range of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance tasks.”China’s claims over the region are challenged by several other countries, including Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, and the Philippines.However, earlier this week China’s leader Xi Jinping said: “We cannot lose even one inch of the territory left behind by our ancestors.“What is other people's we do not want at all.”The US, which Australia views as its “most important defence” ally, is adamant about the freedom of navigation in the area and often orders its warships to sail through the disputed waters.
