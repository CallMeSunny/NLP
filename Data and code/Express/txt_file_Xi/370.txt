  GettyTony Blair will be joining Russian President Vladimir Purtin in ChinaWestern leaders, including David Cameron, Barack Obama and Angela Merkel, have declined invitations to the Victory Day military parade on September 3.The march through Tiananmen Square will mark 70 years since Japan's surrender in 1945.Major world leaders will not be attending as the parade of more than 10,000 Chinese troops is viewed as an attempt to ratchet up tensions with Japan as part of the two countries' ongoing territorial fight.Observers have also said the high-profile commemorations are mainly to boost the domestic political standing of Chinese President Xi Jinping and to show-off China's growing military and political capabilities, with a giant show of military weaponry and equipment expected.

Xi wants to consolidate his power and to show that two and a half years after becoming president he has been able to really become the full commander-in-chief of the nation and the armed forcesJean-Pierre CabestanAccording to the Guardian, former Prime Minister Mr Blair will be joined at the event by Russian leader Mr Putin, whom Mr Xi is close to.Sudan President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who has an International Criminal Court warrant out against him for war crimes, is expected at the parade, as is Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro - who has just deported nearly 800 Colombians from the country, separating children from their parents.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced yesterday he would also shun the parade in protest at what it sees as Beijing's increasingly aggressive foreign policy in the East China Sea.However, former Japanese prime minister Tomiichi Murayama and ex-German chancellor Gerhard Schröder will travel to Beijing for the celebrations.  GettyChinese President Xi Jinping will be leading the Second World War ceremonyMr Blair has been a constant on the Beijing scene since leaving 10 Downing Street in 2007 by making repeated trips to China to meet with senior Communist Party leaders.A Chinese-language version of his memoir, A Journey, was published in the quasi-Communist country in 2011.But his trips have not always pleased Beijing's ruling party, with state media lashing out at "gold-digging" foreign celebrities who were just trying to line their pockets in China after Mr Blair was reportedly paid £316,300 for a single lecture on a 2007 speaking tour of Guandong province.The Government-controlled China Youth Daily, said: "Like reports made by some local officials, there was nothing new in his views. So was the speech worth the large sums of money paid out by local officials and businesses?"  GettySudan President Omar al-Bashir Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist from Hong Kong's Baptist University, said the main aim of September's parade in Beijing was "bolstering Xi's role as China's supremo".He said: "Xi wants to consolidate his power and to show that two and a half years after becoming president he has been able to really become the full commander-in-chief of the nation and the armed forces."As the Chinese stock markets plunge into an abyss, the parade would also serve as a welcome "diversion from economic hardship".Chinese officials have rejected claims Mr Xi's parade is an "aggressive move" or one designed as a deliberate attack on Japan.Zhang Ming, a vice-minister for foreign affairs, said the march was designed to "remember history, cherish the memory of China's revolutionary martyrs, uphold peace and create the future".He said: "The celebrations are not targeting Japan nor the Japanese people."Express.co.uk has contacted Mr Blair's office for a comment.
