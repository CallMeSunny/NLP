   According to the Washington DC-based think tank Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), over 80 percent of cybersecurity experts say Russia is the bigger threat due to their various influence operations and attempts at espionage against political candidates.A third of analysts also believe Russia could potentially target voting systems and voter registration lists as well.Despite claims by Trump, 81 percent of experts view Russia as the biggest threat to the midterm elections while only 10 percent say the same about China and only 2 percent say that about Iran.Vice President Mike Pence and FBI director Christopher Wray have also both previously claimed China is a much larger threat to the US than Russia.
