Full negotiations effectively started in 1981 and concluded with the Sino-British Joint Declaration three years later. Sovereignty was eventually handed back to China on July 1, 1997.The move by China comes after the superpower strengthened its military ties with Russia with the two countries saying they will hold joint missile drills, possibly within three months.
