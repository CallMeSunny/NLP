  GETTYDonald Trump has criticised the United Nations as he tried to deal with North Korea The US President gave his first speech at the UN today, which he used to urge the 193-nation organisation to reduce bureaucracy and define its mission around the world more clearly. It comes after the US urged the UN Security Council to crack down on North Korea as Kim Jong-un continues to build up his nuclear arsenal and carry out dangerous missile tests. Donald Trump said: “In recent years the United Nations has not reached its full potential because of bureaucracy and mismanagement, while the United Nations on a regular budget has increased by 140 per cent and its staff has more than doubled since 2000.

     In recent years the United Nations has not reached its full potentialDonald Trump“The United Nations must hold every level of management accountable, protect whistleblowers and focus on results rather than on process.“I am confident that if we work together and champion truly bold reforms the United Nations will emerge as a stronger, more effective, more just and greater force for peace and harmony in the world.” Related articles   'We're running out of time' North Korea is grave nuclear threat   China and Russia demonstrate military might on North Korea border Mr Trump also said all peacekeeping missions should "have clearly defined goals and metrics for evaluating success” as he called for the UN to become a stronger body and a more effective force for peace. This comes as the US President and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed the situation on the Korean peninsula by telephone on Monday.North Korea fired its latest missile over Japan on Friday, it travelled 2,299 miles meaning the US territory of Guam is now within its reach.   GETTYDonald Trump arrived in Marine One to address the UNThe sanctions that the UN have implemented are an attempt to force North Korea to stop its nuclear tests by starving the country of its fuel and income for its weapons programmes. North Korea has warned more sanctions would only make it accelerate its controversial nuclear programme. Mr Trump repeatedly complained during his 2016 election campaign that the United States pays a disproportionate amount of money to the UN - the US is the biggest contributor and provides 22 per cent of its budget. However, he has spoken less harshly about the UN since he has taken office and has now said it has “tremendous potential”.    UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: “To serve the people we support and the people who support us, we must be nimble and effective, flexible and efficient."Our shared objective is a 21st century U.N. focused more on people and less on process.“Value for money while advancing shared values - that is our common goal."Last Wednesday, Mr Guterres said: “The solution can only be political. “Military action could cause devastation on a scale that would take generations to overcome.”US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said sanctions had banned 90 percent of the Asian state's publicly reported exports, saying of Pyongyang on Friday: "This is totally in their hands on how they respond."The Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called on the international community to remain united and enforce sanctions against North Korea after its repeated launch of ballistic missiles.
