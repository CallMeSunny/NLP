    The US has warned the hermit state it will be “utterly destroyed” if war was to break out between the two countries.Speaking at an emergency UN Security Council meeting, US ambassador Nikki Haley said the United States had never sought war with North Korea.But she said: ”If war does come, it will be because of continued acts of aggression like we witnessed yesterday.“And if war comes, make no mistake, the North Korean regime will be utterly destroyed."   She said the US had asked China, the North’s only major trading partner, to cut off the state’s oil supply.And Mr Trump announced that he had discussed new “major sanctions” on the country as he appeared to cast around for a diplomatic solution.The President tweeted: "Just spoke to President Xi Jinping of China concerning the provocative actions of North Korea. “Additional major sanctions will be imposed on North Korea today. This situation will be handled!"
