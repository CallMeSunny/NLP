   When Donald Trump won the US election in 2016 the President vowed to make trade fairer for Us citizens.Since then, Trump has started a war with some of America’s oldest trading partners, including superpower China.The countries are regarded as the two biggest economics worldwide for global influence and China has since accused the US of launching the "largest trade war in economic history."In an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk, Professor of Business Economics at Brunel University London Francesco Moscone explains what has happened in the economic war so far.
