  GETTYMr Xi is positioning himself as the next Chairman MaoAfter less than five years as secretary general, Xi Jinping has become one of the most powerful people in the nation's modern history. And the 64-year-old is about to give the clearest signal yet of his personal power by enshrining this “thoughts” in the constitution. The constitution already recognises the political theory of “Mao Zedong Thought”, so this move is seen as Mr Xi is putting himself in the same rank as the tyrannical leader.Kerry Brown, a Chinese studies professor at King’s College London, told the Financial Times: “It’s the institutionalisation of the legitimacy of power.

Estimates vary from between 18 and 55 million died through arbitrary executions, purges and forced labour.   GETTYMr Xi is about to start his second term as leaderMr Xi has moved very swiftly in his first term to consolidate his power and stand in the centre of a personality cult not seen since the days of Chairman Mao. He already heads a dozen party agencies controlling everything from economic reforms to state security.Zhang Lifan, a Beijing scholar told TIME magazine: “Xi is directing a building-god campaign, and he is the god." In his tenure as president so far, he as reasserted China’s power in Asia, and ensnared many political opponents in a widely criticised "anti-corruption campaign".   According to a 2016 US report, human rights and the rule of law have deteriorated under Mr Xi’s rule. The CECC report said: “Xi has overseen a deterioration in human-rights and rule of law conditions in China marked by greater consolidation of his own power — leading some analysts to draw comparisons to Mao Zedong — through forced ideological conformity and the systematic persecution of human rights lawyers and defenders.”Just last year the Communist Party gave Mr Xi the title of “core leader”. This has previously been given to just four leaders: Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin and now Mr. Xi. The title does not come with any powers just gives the leader a certain stature, but critics worry that Mr XI will use the title as a way to further assert his control.  GETTYMr Xi ensnared many political opponents in a widely criticised "anti-corruption campaign"At next month’s party congress Mr Xi Jinping is expected to position his closest allies in positions of power in the cabinet reshuffle, in a bid to win an even broader mandate for his policies and authoritarian leadership style.In a further bid for control there are signs that the Communist Party are looked at a way to rethink its retirement age. In 2002 they introduced the rule any senior official aged 68 or above at the time of the twice-a-decade gathering had to step down.  Discover the disputed islands of the South China Sea Wed, May 10, 2017Among the islands at the heart of territorial disputes in the South China Sea.

    Mr Xi will be 69 by the time of the 2022 party congress, which would mark the end of this second term as general secretary. Many previous leaders have used the conger at the beginning of their second term to appoint a successor, but Mr Xi seems unlikely to do this. Cai Mingzhao, the official spokesman of the last congress, batted away journalists questions on the issue and simply said: “The party’s leaders are not there for life.”
