  GETTY / STOCKNew Zealand want to work ever-closer with China over tradeThe 40-year political veteran played a decisive role in bringing the centre-left Labour Party to power in October after an inconclusive election left his nationalist New Zealand First party holding the balance of power.But many in China see New Zealand as a model for the Asian giant's relationship with Western countries, with President Xi Jinping last year calling the depth of the bond "unprecedented"."Our record of trade and economic firsts is dramatic," Mr Peters, who is also deputy prime minister, told academics and diplomats in Wellington, setting out his stance on China for the first time since taking office."New Zealand will continue to seek closer cooperation with China as both countries focus on sustainable economic development and the wellbeing of our peoples," Peters said, giving a complimentary account of 45 years of diplomatic ties.
