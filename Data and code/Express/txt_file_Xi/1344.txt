Or they happened ‘to be closed’ that day, of course.”2.40pm BST: “Geo-political tension” in the Korean Peninsula has forced Malaysia to postpone the Asian Cup qualifier in North Korea for a second time.The match was initially delayed after the murder of Kim Jong-un’s half brother King Jong-nam at a Malaysian airport earlier this year.The Asian Football Club (AFC) rescheduled the match for June 8, but has now pushed it back to October 5.AFC’s president Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim said he was worried about the possibility of sabotage and the safety of match officials. 1.15pm BST: South Korea have opened up possibility of renewing dialogue with North Korea.“Our most basic stance is that communication lines between South and North Korea should open,” Lee Duk-haeng, a spokesman for the South's Unification Ministry, told reporters. “The Unification Ministry has considered options on this internally but nothing has been decided yet.” The news comes after the recent election of South Korea’s first ever liberal president, Moon Jae-in, who campaigned for a moderate approach to the North Korean problem.9.30am BST: South Korea’s new President Moon Jae-in has warned that there is a "high possibility" of conflict with North Korea.6.30am BST: North Korea’s actions are a “recipe for disaster” as Kim Jong-un continues to develop his nuclear capabilities, a top US military official in the Pacific has claimed.Admiral Harry Harris Jr said Kim Jong-un does not care about his failed missile tests as he pushes to create a nuclear arsenal no matter the cost.He added, North Korea is “closer to being able to deliver a nuclear-equipped missile anywhere in the world”.6am BST: North Korea has vowed to continue secret underground nuclear explosions and ballistic missile tests as the sabre rattling hermit kingdom bolsters its military capability.Kim Jong-un’s state media told his citizens testing would continue despite threats and sanctions from three of the world’s greatest superpowers – the US, China and Russia.5.17am BST: US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley called on the international community to support the Trump administration’s efforts in the region.She said: ”You either support North Korea or you support us, because that's what it comes down to."The United States is not past looking at third-country entities who are helping North Korea, and putting sanctions on them, because if you are supporting North Korea, you are against the rest of the international community."3:15am BST: The Trump administration is set to tackle Kim Jong-un’s warmongering with tough new measures to isolate North Korea from the rest of the world, it has been revealed.The US aims to hold Pyongyang responsible for their sabre-rattling by bringing the international community together to use diplomatic, security and economic measures capable cutting North Korea off “from the rest of the world”.1am BST: A North Korean nuclear weapons test is imminent and the “test site” is ready, an expert who has visited their production site has warned.Siegfried Hecker, an expert on North Korea's military programme, believes it is vital for Donald Trump and the South Korean president Moon Jae-in to agree on a united policy to help tackle Kim Jong-un’s aggression.NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR TESTS SITES MAPPED  GETTYSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in is the country's first liberal president Tuesday May 1610pm BST: The United States has insisted it can persuade China to impose new UN sanctions on North Korea.Donald Trump’s nation has said it believed it could "call out" countries supporting Pyongyang.Speaking to reporters ahead of a closed-door UN Security Council meeting on the missile launch, U.
