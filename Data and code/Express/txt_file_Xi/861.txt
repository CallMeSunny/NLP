   The Labour Party MP claimed the American shouldn’t be allowed into the House of Commons – Britain’s democratic heart – after he launched his own “all-out assault on democratic values” after being inaugurated to the White House.She railed against his so-called “Muslim ban” and accused him of being inherently racist.Ms Cooper was branded “hypocritical” and a “fool” after she was challenged over why she hadn’t raised the same objections to China’s President Xi speaking in parliament, after decades of China being accused of various human rights' abuses.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the MP for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford told listeners she agreed with Commons Speaker John Bercow, who spoke out against President Trump’s visit on Monday.  GETTYYvette Cooper was slammed after criticising Donald Trump's proposed UK state visit Yvette Cooper made to look a fool on Radio 4 over her hypocritical slight to the POTUSTwitter user“I personally think it is wrong to reward him with the honour of a state visit, with all of the ceremonial endorsement, and I think that similarly would apply to the ceremonial endorsements that events in parliament would have," she said.“Of course, you can have meetings in Westminster, like you can anywhere else.”Commenting on why she didn’t object to President Xi’s visit in 2015, she said: “I didn’t, but like many people I had concerns and did also raise concerns about the importance of raising with him human rights issues.“That was a very controversial visit and a lot of people objected to a state visit for exactly that reason.   GETTYShe was called a "hypocrite" after failing to challenge President Xi of China's visit@YvetteCooperMP radio4 Today; the stench of your hypocrisy is breathtaking.

We welcome the US president you silly house flipper pretending to be moral but we remember the facts.”Another said: “Yvette Cooper made to look a fool on Radio 4 over her hypocritical slight to the POTUS. Ok for president of China and emir of Kuwait.”    Related articles   John Bercow declares war on Trump as he vows to oppose address to MPs   Congressman SAVAGES John Bercow & hails 'pro-UK' Trump A third posted: “It’s precisely because of people with politics and attitudes like Yvette Cooper that Donald Trump won the presidency.”Speaking after the Labour politician, Jan Halper-Hayes, a member of President Trump’s transition team, also slammed Ms Cooper for her comments.She blasted: “At least she wasn’t shrieking and pounding her chest as much as she usually does.“What she was saying just showed me how much she has got this filter on and has missed it. To again accuse him of racism and to say that he doesn’t respect democratic values.“I don’t know if she was aware that those seven nations were decided by the Obama administration in 2011.” The UK Protests Against President Trump Tue, February 21, 2017President Trump signed an executive order banning immigration to the USA from seven 'muslim' countries.

    Speaker Bercow was widely criticised for his speech in the House of Commons on Monday, but Ms Halper-Hayes said President Trump would be unlikely to be bothered by his comments.She said the relationship was between America and Theresa May, and would listen to her guidance on the matter.“Donald Trump has learned that there will be people who will criticise him and then there are people who get him and support him,” she said.“He is focused on his mission and will stay focused on that.”
