       The presence of the PLA in the city has long been one of the most sensitive parts of the city's reversion to Chinese rule, but the garrison has kept a noticeably low-key presence. Hong Kong's large and well-equipped police force - dominated by Hong Kong recruits – remains responsible for routine domestic security and was protecting the streets surrounding the base on Friday. President Xi's formal inspection echoed that performed by his predecessor, Hu Jintao, at the same Shek Kong airfield five years ago. Standing before a bank of microphones in an open-car in sweltering temperatures of more than 30 degrees Celsius.
