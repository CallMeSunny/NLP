    Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping have met twice in the last two months in Wuhan and Qingdao to try to keep peace between the two countries.Sino-Indian relations have been strained by border disputes and economic competition since 1950.They fought a war over their unresolved border in 1962, and the ongoing rivalry has escalated over China's friendly relationship with Pakistan, India's top rival.The Chinese envoy claimed on Monday a trilateral summit between China, Pakistan and India would be "very constructive”.   He said: "This is a proposal suggested by some Indian friends and it is a very a good and constructive idea.“Maybe not now, but in the future, that is the great idea.”However, today China distanced itself from its envoy's comments on the idea of trilateral cooperation between India, China and Pakistan, but highlighted the importance of dialogue with New Delhi.
