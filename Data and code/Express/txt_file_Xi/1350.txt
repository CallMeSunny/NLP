   Tensions developed between North Korea and the US last year as they appeared on the brink of war last year due to their leaders trading insults and threats.In September, after North Korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test, Mr Trump said in a tweet that Kim was "obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people".Kim responded by branding Mr Trump "a mentally deranged US dotard".However, Kim made a dramatic offer in March to meet Trump and discuss nuclear disarmament, which the US president quickly accepted.US officials have reportedly established a contingency plan for a potential second day of discussions between Trump and Kim depending on the direction of their planned meeting on Tueday, June 12.Here are the latest updates on the summit as they develop (all times in BST).  Related articles   Kim Jong-un arrives in Singapore ahead of summit with Donald Trump   Preparing for WAR - US troops on manouevres near North Korean border 7.30pm update: Body language expert warns Trump faces challengeIt's not all about what Mr Trump does on Tuesday but how he does it, a body language expert has warned. Julie Giguere, MD of international interpretation and translation specialists Asian Absolute, said: "There may be an expectation for President Trump to make small, respectful bow towards Kim Jong-Un. Other cultural aspects are important to consider, for example, saying 'no' outright just isn’t done in North Korean business etiquette."You can tip your head backwards or suck in a little air through your teeth. You might sometime say 'maybe', but saying 'no' is considered extremely rude."Failure to understand and respect fundamental cultural differences can really undermine your chances of getting an optimum outcome from your meeting."5pm update: A family affairKim Yo Jung, the younger sister of Kim, was pictured getting into a vehicle, which then headed for the Istana, to attend a meeting with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in Singapore. She is reportedly becoming Kim's closest confidante and potentially the second-most powerful figure in his regime.It is not the first time she has been by her brother's side during an official engagement. Kim Yo Jong, who is believed to be about 30 years old, was the first member of the ruling North Korean family to travel to South Korea in February for the Olympics.She walked with Kim across the line dividing the two Koreas with his delegation and joined him for the first round of talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.Former intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol, the top cadre in charge of relations with the South, was the only other North Korean official present at the time.   Kim Yo Jong pictured in Singapore (Image: REUTERS)4.01pm update: No photos allowedWhile a dozen North Korean journalists flanked by dozens of North Korean security men worked to capture Kim's every movement, guests in the St. Regis hotel lobby were repeatedly told by Singapore police and hotel staffs not to take pictures of any North Koreans, especially Kim.When a couple of guests were seen sneaking a photo, a North Korean official stormed up to them, demanding to check their phones."I saw them taking a photo of our chairman. How dare they do so, they shouldn't," the official told Reuters later. He declined to be identified.Under the watchful eye of the official, and St. Regis staff, one browbeaten male guest deleted his photos.A female guest, challenged by the same North Korean official, said she had only taken photos of the lobby and refused to show her phone.After taking her to a private area, hotel staff assured the North Korean official that the guest did not have photos of Kim.Other guests were bemused."What do you expect? It's North Korea," said one Western tourist with a shrug.Nicola Harding, visiting from Britain, said that it was all "a little weird".

You know, the way they say you know if you’re going to like somebody in the first five seconds, you ever hear that one?“I think very quickly I’ll know whether or not something good is going to happen.” Trump Kim summit in pictures Sun, June 10, 2018Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump will meet on June 12 for an unprecedented summit.
