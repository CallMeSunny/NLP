The item came up to her neck and past her feet on the floor.A heavy white floral brocade print featured down the middle and on the sleeves of the dress.Smaller, more delicate pink flowers could also be seen decorating the dress.As the print was so striking, Melania opted not to wear jewellery with her outfit.
