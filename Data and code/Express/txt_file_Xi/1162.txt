   The warning comes after Kim Jong-un’s regime threatened to defend itself in the wake of a US military show of force in the region. The Trump administration wants to stop North Korea’s nuclear programme through peaceful means such as pushing for tougher Chinese sanctions.But the US President is also keeping the military option on the table after sending an aircraft carrier and nuclear-powered submarine towards North Korea.  "There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely," Mr Trump told Reuters."We'd love to solve things diplomatically but it's very difficult.” Related articles   North Korea LIVE: Latest news as Kim Jong-un threatens WAR   North Korea warns conflict is ‘inching towards EXPLOSION’  Mr Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for ‘trying very hard’ to rein in Pyongyang, adding: “He certainly doesn’t want to see turmoil and death.” Dr Natasha Ezrow, a senior lecturer in government at the University of Essex, said she would be very shocked if Mr Trump got any more involved in North Korea.  There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North KoreaUS President Donald TrumpThe political scientist, who is a leading authority on dictatorships, said that she cannot see how a US attack on North Korea could be “politically possible”.“I can’t see any political benefit for Trump of getting marred in this situation any more,” she said, noting that it would only lead to danger. Not only is there no public appetite for war against North Korea, Pyongyang has the power to launch missile attacks against South Korea, Japan and US bases in both nations. But Dr Ezrow said: “A nuclear war is very unlikely, it is way too costly. It would be suicide for the North Korean regime to engage in that. It is almost completely unlikely.”   ReutersWill Donald Trump attack the reclusive regime of Kim Jong-un? Despite Kim Jong-un’s sabre rattling, Dr Ezrow said that North Korea’s regime has been “all talk but no bite in the past” and depends on China for its survival. If North Korea goes too far then it risks falling out with China, which is the economic lifeline of Kim-Jong Un’s reclusive, isolated regime. Dr Ezrow said that the regime makes threats to get attention and increase its bargaining power, adding: “It can’t survive without China.” In response to escalating tensions with North Korea, America is planning to activate its THAAD anti-missile defence system in South Korea within days.  Photos from North Korea during celebration of the birth of late leader Kim Il Sung Wed, April 19, 2017Covering a North Korean military parade is an emotional roller coaster, a visual and sensory barrage of socialist-realist propaganda Play slideshow  AFP/Getty Images1 of 23North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (R) attending a military parade in Pyongyang marking the 105th anniversary of the birth of late North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung
