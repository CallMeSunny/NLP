   All is not black and white in the world of Berlin Zoo’s four year old Meng Meng as she turns into the panda equivalent of a moody teenager.Whether it is because she does not like her bamboo diet or the care being offered by her devoted keepers, Meng Meng is displaying the panda equivalent of teenage tantrums by repeatedly walking backwards.To help her overcome her woes, experts at the famous German animal park have decided to introduce Meng Meng with male Jiao Qing early next year when the traditional panda mating season begins.Berlin zoo director Andreas Knieriem said: “Meng Meng is in puberty. The reverse walk is a protest against things she dislikes, be it the food or the carers.”  Related articles   Abandoned at birth and looking for love: The adorable baby...   Panic at zoo as two lions ESCAPE from their enclosure “By then, Meng Meng will have reached sexual maturity and could focus all her energy on seducing her partner."Meng Meng and Jiao Qing have been kept in separate quarters since they arrived in Berlin with a fanfare earlier this year.German chancellor Angela Merkel and China’s president Xi Jinping opened the zoo’s £7.6 million panda compound where they are major tourist attractions.  GETTY/BERLIN ZOOBerlin Zoo’s four-year-old Meng Meng has developed a habit of walking backwardsPanda diplomacy has become a key feature of East-West relations with China loaning its symbolic animals to zoos around the world for huge figures.RZSS Edinburgh Zoo has a £600,000 a year agreement with the Chinese authorities to loan pandas Tian Tian and partner Yang Guang for a decade, although hopes of producing the first even British-born baby bear floundered a few weeks ago.Attempts to artificially inseminate female Tian, whose name means Sweetie, generated global excitement when her pregnancy was confirmed but, sadly, the zoo announced last month that she had lost her unborn cub.  BERLIN ZOOThe reverse walk is a protest against things she dislikes, the food or the carers, says the zooWhile Tian Tian and Yang Guang needed outside help for their mating games, Germany is hoping their pandas will do things naturally when the female comes into season early next year.Besides helping Meng Meng’s moods, a baby panda could also become a gold strike for Berlin Zoo chiefs.When Tokyo’s Ueno Zoo celebrated its panda birth in June, a leading Japanese economist made bold predictions for the resulting tourism bonanza, estimating the cub would be worth £190 million for the city in subsequent months.

    Katsuhiro Miyamoto, professor emeritus at Kansai University in Osaka Prefecture, said the baby panda’s birth would bolster Tokyo’s economy by ¥26.7 billion Yen a year (£190,042,600).He predicted Ueno Zoo would welcome 5.66 million visitors during the second half of 2017, up 47.2 per cent on 2016 figures, as well as heralding increased spending on dining, shopping and accommodation in and around the complex.
