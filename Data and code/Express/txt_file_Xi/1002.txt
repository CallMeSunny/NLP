     He’s not agitating for a move but, if the right offer comes in, something is likely to happenMan Utd sourceA source told The Sun: “Wayne has generally been very happy at United for the past 13 years and was delighted to become the club’s record goalscorer.“But he has dropped down the pecking order and there comes a time in everyone’s career when you have to consider whether it might be sensible to move. He’s not agitating for a move but, if the right offer comes in, something is likely to happen.“It’s highly unlikely a move will be completed before the end of the Chinese Super League transfer window though.”Chinese president Xi Jinping would apparently need to sanction any record-breaking transfer.And while Rooney is not being pushed out the door by Jose Mourinho, the United boss couldn't guarantee this week that the forward would be at Old Trafford by the summer.
