   Relations between the two largest economies in the world have turned increasingly sour in recent months as US President Donald Trump persists in waging an economic trade war with the Chinese.This week the US Air Force conducted B-52 bomber flights over the disputed South China Sea region, in what is likely to incense Chinese President Xi-Jinping amid the relentless punitive trade tariffs Trump is slapping on the Asian superpower.A total of four B-52 fighter aircraft could be seen traversing through the skies over the disputed sea on Monday.A second wave tore across the East China Sea on Tuesday.

If it was 20 years ago and had China not militarised those features there, it would have been just another bomber on its way to Diego Garcia or wherever.”The US uses Diego Garcia, the largest island on the Chagos Archipelago, as a military base in the region.
