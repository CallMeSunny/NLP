  'Strong Man is an incontstably bad thing' (Image: GETTY )Following the re-election of President Erdogan in Turkey over the weekend, the former secretary of state for foreign affairs declared having "strong men" world leaders “is an incontestably bad thing".Mr Hague said: “Be in no doubt whatever that so many countries voting for or acquiescing in their version of a Strong Man is an incontestably bad thing.“Today’s Strong Man undermines, insults and destroys if he can any check, balance, alternative candidate or contrary opinion.“We know that this will be disastrous for the country concerned and sometimes for the whole world. For a start, we know this from the history that some of these leaders have not bothered to read.” Related articles   Tory rebels MUST back May's Brexit bill or play into hands of EU an...   Peter Hitchens LETS RIP at Tories for trying to be party of the SPLIFF Mr Hague added that around the globe, individual figureheads are ruling and deciding the entire direction of their nation.He pointed out leaders in countries including Egypt, Hungary, Russia and the US are restricting freedoms and threatening critics.He said: “It is a paradox of the early twenty-first century that the more the world develops complexity beyond the understanding of any individual and the more millions of highly-educated people graduate from outstanding universities, the greater the tendency to reach for the single leader who will alone determine the fate of a nation.“The general direction is clear: Putin intends to rule indefinitely; Xi Jinping has concentrated more power in his hands than any Chinese leader since Mao and has now provided for his own perpetual reappointment; Egypt allows no credible challenger to President Sisi.“In democracies, Viktor Orban is showing in Hungary how the media and judicial restraints on governments can be weakened and more populist leaders across the continent would like to follow suit.

    “President Trump, while hemmed in by judges and commentators whom he threatens and bullies, removes officials who disagree with him and is at home with the Strong Man idea.”President Erdogan was re-elected on Sunday with almost 53 percent of Turkey’s electoral vote.In a speech as the final ballots came in, Mr Erdogan said he wished for nobody to “damage democracy” by challenging the results.He said: “The Turkish public has mandated me as president according to official results.“I hope nobody will damage democracy by casting a shadow on this election and its results to hide their failure.”   A referendum last year saw Turkey vote in favour of scrapping their Prime Minister role.Erdogan now has the power to appoint judges and unelected Vice Presidents, among other responsibilities.Erdogan has polarised opinion during his time in office, having presided over a strong economy, but also putting some 160,000 people in prison including journalists and teenagers.Under the new constitution, he could stand for a third term when this one ends in 2023, meaning he could rule until 2028.
