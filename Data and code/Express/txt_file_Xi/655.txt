   The South Asian country is in desperate need of a further bailout despite receiving a £4.6billion ($6bn) rescue package from Saudi Arabia just last month.Former cricket star Imran Khan took office in August after a landslide victory but the looming crisis over Islamabad’s dwindling reserves of foreign currency mean it could soon run out of cash to pay its debts.Pakistan is now hoping to secure help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to avert the crisis in what would be the nation’s 13th rescue package from the lender in 30 years.During a trip to China today, Mr Khan acknowledged his country has hit a “low point”.

Unfortunately we have inherited a very difficult economic situation."Countries go in cycles. They have their high points, they have their low points.“Unfortunately, our country is going through a low point at the moment with two very big deficits, a fiscal deficit and a current account deficit.”China is one of Pakistan’s closest allies, and the Asian superpower today pledged to continue helping Mr Khan.
