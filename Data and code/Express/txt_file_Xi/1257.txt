  GETTYDonald Trump has delivered harsh words over the South China SeaDonald Trump’s heavy handed approach to the South China sea - a billion dollar trade route - has angered his counterpart in beijing.While the White House insists it must have a say over the resource-rich stretch of sea, experts are warning he has bitten off more than he can chew with China.A missile-packed military fortress surrounds China which has cleverly constructed islands which work as stationary aircraft carriers under the leadership of Xi Jinping. The fortified islands are designed to shoot planes out of the sky - and sink approaching war ships.The sheer size of the kill zone has caused extreme concern for US commanders.  GETTYChina's military power should not be underestimated according to experts Some China-watchers have said that China plays Go (a game of position), while America tends to be a poker playerCommander Thomas ShugartFor months, China has said with certainty it would take a war for them to leave the islands, seemingly confident enough to go up against one of the world’s biggest Naval forces."Some China-watchers have said that China plays Go (a game of position), while America tends to be a poker player — daring its opponents to call its bets," Commander Thomas Shugart, a submarine warfare officer in the US Navy said."By staking out its bold new positions in the South China Sea, China’s goal may be to up the ante to a point where the United States is faced with a tough choice: put a pile of chips on the table and risk huge losses or fold up its cards and go home."The United States should do what it takes now to ensure that the game doesn’t get to that point."

They will take measures to ensure their bases have a chance of surviving in combat long enough to matter.""China’s island bases are being built from scratch in the era of precision strike and are therefore able to have appropriate countermeasures 'baked in' from the start."Tough talk from Trump’s aides has suggested the US has no plans to bow to Beijing.

They’re taking their sandbars and making basically stationary aircraft carriers and putting missiles on those."They come here to the US in front of our face – and you understand how important face is – and say it’s an ancient territorial sea.”
