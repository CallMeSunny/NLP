   North Korea would unleash a "fairly large scale" attack to counteract any intrusion in the military state.Dr Zala said: "There really isn’t a military option here. There is no sensible way of using military force to actually achieve the goal of denuclearising North Korea and being able to be sure that that has actually been successful."Even if we did so the cost would simply be too high. The retaliation from North Korea would be instant and would be on a fairly large scale."  GETTY/SKY NEWS AUDr Ben Zala said North Korea would immediately retaliate to any military approachSpeaking to Sky News Australia, the international relations expert added that the tense situation between North Korea and neighbouring countries could easily result in "miscalculations" with terrible results.He continued: "The tensions are so high that it means that the risks of a miscalculation – and of the tensions really ratcheting up to a point where decision are made in a very short time period – are always with us."It comes as China sent a special envoy to Pyongyang in the aftermath of US President Donald Trump's tour of Asia.Chinese President Xi Jinping dispatched his head of international liaison Song Tao to meet their rogue ally at the end of this week.   North Korea has been engaged in an aggressive war of word with President Trump ever since the US President threatened leader Kim Jong-un with "fiery and fury" if it continued to develop nuclear missiles.But fears of World War 3 continue to grow as a 5.4 earthquake in the Sea of Japan gave rise to concern of a possible new nuclear test carried out in North Korea.In September experts began to monitor Pyongyang after Kim Jong-un triggered an earthquake with one of his tests.The head of the nuclear test monitoring agency CTBTO said that its analysts were "looking at unusual seismic activity" in North Korea.
