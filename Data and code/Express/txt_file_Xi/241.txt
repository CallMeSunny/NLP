    “Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States should look to our past and you will doubt it no longer. We will not permit America or our allies, to be blackmailed or attacked. We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.“We will not be intimidated and we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.”During his trip to Asia President Trump is aiming to present a united front to stand up against North Korea’s dictator.
