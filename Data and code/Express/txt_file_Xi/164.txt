  GETTYChina has conducted the first HGV missile test in the worldIn November, China’s People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force conducted two flight tests of a new ballistic missile that was attached to a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV).A HGV is a form of aircraft that is capable of reaching speeds five times faster than the speed of sound, allowing it to deliver nuclear weapons to their target in a matter of seconds.According to the US official the test was “the first HGV test in the world using a system intended to be fielded operationally”.

    The HGV tested on November 1 is said to have been specifically designed for a medium-range ballistic missile called DF-17 and landed “within metres” of its intended target.A second test of the missile took place on November 15.According to US officials the missile is expected to become fully operational by 2020.A National Air and Space Intelligence Centre report released in June warned that HGVs could be more dangerous as they were harder to defend against due to the speed the missile travels at.   It said: “The combination of high speed, manoeuvrability, and relatively low altitudes makes HGVs challenging targets for missile defence systems.”The planned introduction of the HGV into China’s nuclear arsenal comes after President Xi Jinping used the Communist Party’s 19th conference to unveil his plans to make a “world-class military”.Centred around a new, condensed structure of 84 military units, the military reshuffle builds on Xi's years-long efforts to modernise the PLA with greater emphasis on new capabilities including cyberspace, electronic and information warfare.As chair of the Central Military Commission, Xi is also commander-in-chief of China's armed forces.
