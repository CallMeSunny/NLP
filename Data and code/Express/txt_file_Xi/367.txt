   A more than two-thirds surge in Chinese investment last year into Europe’s high-tech manufacturing, infrastructure and energy sectors has prompted European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to set up a group “to elaborate first possible actions”.In September he will announce a tranche of measures to tackle perceived gaps in the EU’s protections compared to other major economies such as the US, people briefed on the talks said.The EU is concerned about China buying-up European knowledge yet placing heavy restrictions on how Europeans invest in the Asian nation.Last year’s surge led to Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) into the EU reaching £32billion, a report by the Mercator Institute for China Studies and the Rhodium Group revealed.
