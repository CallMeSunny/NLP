    US officials have been quick to distance themselves from Trump’s campaign rhetoric surrounding Nato, given his repeated criticisms of the alliance.In January, he told former Cabinet minister Michael Gove: "I said a long time ago that Nato had problems. Number one it was obsolete, because it was designed many, many years ago.   “Number two the countries aren’t paying what they’re supposed to pay.“We’re supposed to protect countries, but a lot of these countries aren’t paying what they’re supposed to be paying, which I think is very unfair to the United States.”At the moment just the US, Britain, Greece, Poland and Estonia are spending the minimum target of two per cent of their GDP on defence, despite a commitment in 2014 from all 28 Nato members to reach the two per cent spending target by 2024.
