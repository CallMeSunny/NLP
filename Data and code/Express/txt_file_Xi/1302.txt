   The US President has travelled to the region for a 12-day tour and North Korea is expected to be high on his agenda for meetings with South Korea's Moon Jae-in, China's Xi Jinping, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe and Russian president Vladimir Putin.Trump vowed to "totally destroy" North Korea if it poses a threat to the US or its allies in a speech to the UN in September, to which the North Korean leader branded Trump "mentally deranged" while his foreign minister remarked that Pyongyang could consider a hydrogen bomb test of an unprecedented scale on the Pacific Ocean.Donald Trump’s UN ambassador Nikki Haley and the President himself have said “the time for talk is over”, despite China, Russia, and other members of the US administration claiming dialogue remains the main aim.The US military has a huge presence in the area around North Korea, particularly in Japan and increasingly close allies South Korea.There are almost 40,000 US troops serving in Japan, more than in any other country, and earlier this year the US Air Force lined up a huge array of helicopters, tactical fighter jets and surveillance aircraft in a show of force aimed to intimidate Kim Jong-un.

    There is also the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system, which, despite criticism from Beijing and Pyongyang, is ready and waiting to intercept missiles and destroy the incoming projectiles while in mid-flight.Guam, the US territory that Kim Jong-un has threatened to fire four ballistic missiles towards, is also host to a huge military presence. Much of the island is controlled by the armed forces and the Andersen air base hosts a range of bombers, resulting in Guam being dubbed a “permanent aircraft carrier”.Among the aircraft at the base are B-1B bombers, B-52 bombers and F-35B stealth fighters, some of the US Air Force’s most impressive jets.  GETTYThe revered B-52 bomber is capable of carrying more than 30 tonnes of weapons  ANDERSEN AIR BASE GUAMB-1b fly from Guam to Japanese territory over the Korean peninsulaThe B-1B bomber is heralded for its survivability and although initially designed to carry nuclear arms, it was converted to carry more conventional weaponry after the Cold War.The US is believed to have at least six B-1B bombers stationed in Guam and is best suited to a ‘medium threat environment’, rather than a heavily defended airspace.Speaking about plans for a possible preemptive strike on North Korea earlier this month, retired Admiral James Stavridis told NBC News: “The B-1b has also been selected because it has the added benefit of not being able to carry nuclear weapons. “Military planners think that will signal China, Russia, and Pyongyang that the US is not trying to escalate an already bad situation any further."The B-52 was first introduced in 1955 and was originally designed to carry nuclear weapons during the Cold War. It remains one of the most superior aircraft in the US Air Force. The long-range, subsonic, jet-powered strategic bomber is capable of carrying more than 30 tons of weapons. The aircraft’s fearsome appearance and reputation has resulted in the nickname BUFF, which stands for Big Ugly Fat F*****.The US also maintains a smaller presence in other countries in the region, including Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines. US military aircraft use Thai runways while the US Navy will operate four warships out of Singapore by next year.

      GETTYUS and Japanese bombers carried out drills over the Korean peninsula in SeptemberTensions have been stepped across the region over recent days following North Korea firing a test missile over Japan.The provocative action saw South Korea and US forces drop bombs on the border of the hermit state.Earlier today France warned the situation was "extremely serious".Foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian warned a nuclear strike on Europe was possible and said a world war could erupt in months.He said: "The situation is extremely serious... we see North Korea setting itself as an objective to have, tomorrow or the day after, missiles that can transport nuclear weapons."In a few months that will be a reality."
