   The sighting was reported by US think tank Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI), who said the J-11 fighter was visible in a satellite image of Woody Island, taken on March 29.News of the deployment came as US President Donald Trump was due to hold his first meetings with China’s President Xi Jinxing in Florida.At the meetings, Mr Trump is expected to air US concerns about China’s pursuit of territory and militarisation of outposts in the South China Sea.

GETTYPresident Xi Jinping will meet Donald Trump in FloridaThe United States has said in the past that deployments of Chinese fighter jets to Woody Island were part of a disturbing trend of militarisation that raised questions about Beijing’s intentions in the South China Sea, which is an important trade route. China has previously denied these accusations, with Premier Li Keqiang claiming the defence equipment was placed on islands in the disputed waterway to maintain "freedom of navigation."
