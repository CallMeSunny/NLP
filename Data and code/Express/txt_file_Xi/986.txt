    The deployment was met by opposition from locals as hundreds of residents clashed with police, protesting against the controversial defence system.Kang Hyun-wook, a religious figure staging a street rally, told Yonhap News Agency: "Police let THAAD equipment pass through [the protests] by repressing them.  AFPThe equipment was moved under police guard following protests from some locals"The THAAD deployment is illegal and should be nullified."Meanwhile, a spokesman for South Korean president frontrunner Moon Jae-in said the move to deploy the THAAD system was “very inappropriate”.In a statement, Moon’s spokesman said the deployment stripped South Korea’s next government of the right to make a policy decision on the controversial system.Chinese officials are likely to be angered by the move, having opposed the deployment of THAAD to South Korea since it was agreed between Seoul and Washington last year.Tensions between North Korea and the international community have increased significantly in recent weeks, with Pyongyang claiming leader Kim Jong-un had overseen the country’s “largest-ever” live-fire drill to mark the 85th founding anniversary of its military.  GETTYThe THAAD deployment could put Trump's relations with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at riskKCNA, the state-controlled media service, reported: "The brave artillerymen mercilessly and satisfactorily hit the targets and the gunshots were very correct, he said, adding that they showed well the volley of gunfire of our a-match-for-a-hundred artillery force giving merciless punishment to the hostile forces.”President Trump is due to address the House of Representatives on Wednesday evening in a bid to negotiate a satisfactory method of dealing with the threat from North Korea.Whether the deployment of THAAD will have a big impact on ties between Washington and Beijing is yet to be seen.
