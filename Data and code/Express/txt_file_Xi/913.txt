   Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google and executive chairman of its parent company, Alphabet, predicted China and the US will each lead a distinct internet.The tech guru praised China’s “fantastic leadership in products and services”, and deemed more than plausible to have the country part of the internet in the near future.Speaking at a private event in San Francisco on Wednesday night convened by investment firm Village Global VC, Mr Schmidt said: "I think the most likely scenario now is not a splintering, but rather a bifurcation into a Chinese-led internet and a non-Chinese internet led by America.“If you look at China, and I was just there, the scale of the companies that are being built, the services being built, the wealth that is being created is phenomenal.  Related articles   WW3 WARNING: China rages at US for creating ‘trouble’ in ‘peaceful’...

Globalisation means that they get to play too.“I think you're going to see fantastic leadership in products and services from China.”However, a Chinese-led internet would carry not only a new set of expertise but also higher levels of censorship.”   Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said the internet could split in two by 2028 (Image: GETTY) Related articles   China news: Global market fears SPARKED as China issues WARNING   US trade war with China could last 20 YEARS - shock warning   Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt predicted China and the US will each lead a distinct internet (Image: GETTY)  China's President Xi Jinping (Image: GETTY)Mr Schmidt said: “There's a real danger that along with those products and services comes a different leadership regime from government, with censorship, controls, etc.“Look at the way BRI works – their Belt and Road Initiative, which involves 60-ish countries – it's perfectly possible those countries will begin to take on the infrastructure that China has with some loss of freedom."The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a development strategy adopted by the Chinese government.Aiming at increasing the Chinese influence on a global level, the BRI works to connect and ease trading across the world, both physical and digital.
