    Donald Trump has been vocal over his disdain for Nato, and the amount its members pay, previously calling the organisation ‘obsolete’. And he has done little to allay fears since taking office, with the White House still not nominating a Nato ambassador. His administration officials have trying to minimise his views and stress the importance of Nato, with little effect.  GETTYMr Tillerson had initially declined to attend the first gathering of Nato foreign ministersAdding to a perceived lacklustre attitude towards Nato, Mr Tillerson had initially declined to attend the first gathering of Nato foreign ministers, as it conflicted with a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Washington and a scheduled trip to Moscow. Despite being able to make all three engagements, as the secretary travels on a US Air Force jet, Nato rescheduled the meeting for Friday. During US Defence Secretary James Mattis first visit to Nato last month, he too stressed the importance of members paying more, but added that a failure to do so could see the US “moderate” its support for the alliance.

Nevertheless, Germany owes . . . vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defence it provides to Germany!"
