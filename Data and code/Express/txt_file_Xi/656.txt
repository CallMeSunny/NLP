   The officers broke in to Yongfu Church, in China’s Fujian province, during a Sunday service, refusing to show identification or warrants.They claimed they were there to “enforce the laws” and ordered worshippers to leave, as the communist government tightens its control on worship.China Aid, a Christian human rights organisation, said a one-year-old child was left with an eye injury after their mother attempted to flee and was “chastised” by a government agent during the raid on October 21.Pastor Lin Kezhen told how he asked the officers to speak to him after the service, but was confronted with shouting that the service should be stopped, people should leave and worshippers should not attend the church.
