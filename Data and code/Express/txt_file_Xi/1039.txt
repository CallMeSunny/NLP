Under the authorisation of Workers' Party Chairman Kim Jong Un, the Central Committee sends the warmest greetings to the people and soldiers who concluded the 70-day battle with the greatest of victoryKim Yong NamBut there was no sign of that at Tuesday's rally, where thousands shouted "manse!", or "live forever!" while clasping their hands in the air or waving pink flowers as they passed before Kim and other top officials on a leaders' platform.Kim, 33, had traded the western-style suit he wore at the four-day congress for the more traditional uniform of NorthKorean leaders, a dark jacket buttoned to the collar.He smiled and waved at the crowd and chatted with military and party aides, state media footage showed.   Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, who was formally elected by the congress to the party's Central Committee, stood next to him for some of the time.The young leader Kim, who assumed power in 2011 after his father's death, took on the new title of party chairman on Monday. The promotion - his previous party title was first secretary - had been predicted by analysts who had expected Kim would use the congress to further shore up his power.

GETTYNorth Korea had been engaged in a 70-day campaign of accelerated productivitySouth Korea President Park Geun-hye said the North showed no sign of willingness to change but only made "preposterous claims about being a nuclear weapons state".The two Koreas remain in a technical state of war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.North Korea regularly threatens the South and its major ally, the United States, which it accuses of planning a nuclear attack.Relations between the Koreas have been at a low since North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in January, which also brought tougher U.N. sanctions backed by lone major ally China, which disapproves of North Korea's development of nuclear weapons.  GETTYKim, 33, had traded the western-style suit he wore at the four-day congress for uniformDespite the sanctions, North Korea has pressed ahead with its nuclear and missile development, and said it had succeeded in miniaturising a nuclear warhead and launching a submarine-based ballistic missile.Chinese President Xi Jinping sent congratulations to Kim for his promotion at the party congress. There was no direct mention of North Korea's nuclear programme in Xi's message."We will make efforts together with the DPRK side to bring happiness to the two countries and their peoples and contribute to peace, stability and development in this region by steadily developing the Sino-DPRK friendship and cooperation," North Korea's state KCNA news agency quoted Xi as saying.
