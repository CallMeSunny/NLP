  Donald Trump has declared a 'national emergency' (Image: GETTY)The US leader has banned the Chinese firm from buying US technology without seeking special approval, while also effectively barring its equipment from being used by US telecom networks. President Trump first took action by signing an executive order declaring a national emergency and banning US companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms deemed to pose a national security risk. While this order, which invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, did not initially name Huawei, his administration took separation action hours later by releasing a blacklist of companies. The commerce department added Huawei and 70 companies to this banned list, meaning they must now seek government approval to use components and technology from US companies.
