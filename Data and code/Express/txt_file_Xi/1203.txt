  HSIActivists bottle fed the dogs and nursed them back to health after the dramatic rescueANIMAL rights activists launched a three day stand-off with a lorry driver to rescue hundreds of dogs destined for the dinner table at China’s Yulin Dog Meat Festival.Campaigners halted a truck on the Tianjin highway outside Beijing, after spotting it crammed with sick and injured dogs in squalid conditions, heading for slaughter at the sick annual festival which will see about 10,000 dogs killed.Many were still wearing collars and pet tags, which activists say proves they are clearly stolen pets.After flagging down the truck, Humane Society International activists refused to leave the dogs until they were released.

    Restaurant owners claim eating dog meat is traditional during the summer, but animal rights activists say the festival has no cultural value and was merely invented to drum up business.Ms Higgins said: “Most people in China don’t in fact eat dogs, and there is massive Chinese opposition to this trade that sees people’s beloved pets stolen and brutalised.“Our petition is gathering millions of signatures from across the world calling on Xi Jingping to end Yulin and the cruel dog meat trade.”Yulin authorities previously denied the killing of dogs even took place but have now said they would tightly control pubic order, prosecute those stealing or poisoning dogs, adding traders would no longer be permitted to slaughter dogs in public.  HSIIn total around 200 dogs were rescued from death for the Yulin Dog Meat FestivalBut an estimated 10 to 20 million dogs are still being killed for human consumption every year in China.Now, with the support of the charity, a host of British celebrities have given their backing to the #StopYulin campaign.Made in Chelsea’s Lucy Watson, Emmerdale’s Gemma Atkinson and comedian Ricky Gervais are among the hordes of people who tweeted a ‘dog selfie’ for HSI.Miss Watson and her German Spitz Klein, Digby, added their selfie, adding: "No animal deserves to be abused and mutilated the way the dogs in the meat festival are and to think that could be my dog/best friend, Digby, is unbearable.“Something needs to be done, we cannot sit back and watch this cruelty continue.”   Ricky Gervais, comedian and animal rights campaigner, has also joined HSI once again to call for an end to the disgusting practice.He tweeted: “The dogs are tortured to "make the meat tastier". They are also skinned and boiled alive.“It's not a food festival. It's Hell.”The celebrities have also urged their fans to sign an online petition to Chinese President Xi Jinping to halt the festival entirely.
