    The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission released a report last year claiming Chinese spies repeatedly infiltrated US national security agencies, including official email accounts, and stole state secrets.The report added: "The United States faces a large and growing threat to its national security from Chinese intelligence collection operations."Among the most serious threats are China’s efforts at cyber and human infiltration of US national security entities."   In 2015, four Chinese-speaking hackers were arrested in China for their involvement in the breach of the US Office of Personnel Management’s database.Chinese hackers have recently been accused of building a “back door” into software in an attempt to spy on the UK’s top businesses.The code has been spread around the world through a compromised software update for server management software from tech firm NetSarang.  GETTYChina is building four to six new cyber security schools  GETTYChina has been accused of being involved in a series of cyber hacksThe hack means businesses’ data could be accessed and puts systems at risk of interference from the codes creator.A statement from NetSarang said: “Regretfully, the build release of our full line of products on July 18 was unknowingly shipped with a back door, which had the potential to be exploited by its creator.”Professor Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey, told The Times: “This is a particularly worrying attack. As far as clients were concerned this appeared to be perfectly legitimate software via an update.“It was even digitally signed, which suggests the vendor had been penetrated thoroughly enough, maybe even an inside job, to make this look completely legitimate to customers.“We’ve seen a series of these types of attack where the software supply chain has been compromised, so this may be the beginning of a trend that software vendors will need to take particular note of.”
