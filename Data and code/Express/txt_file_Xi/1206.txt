  Putin said the ban was no tragedy [GETTY] If Russia continues to behave like this it will face growing political and diplomatic isolation.David CameronMoscow scoffed at the West’s actions as military experts warned there is now an 80 per cent chance of war between Putin’s regime and the Ukraine. Today international leaders again met at the Hague and vowed “significant sanctions” against Russia. David Cameron said he wanted to make sure the international community spoke “with vigour” about Moscow’s behaviour. His words came as 10,000 Russian troops conducted military exercises amid fears Putin may now make a grab for the Russian-leaning east of Ukraine.  Last night the British Prime Minister and other G7 leaders effectively froze Russia out of the elite G8 group by boycotting a planned meeting in Sochi. However Moscow appeared unmoved by the West's attempts to isolate Russia, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: "The G8 is an informal club, it has no membership tickets, and it can't purge anyone by definition."  Today, Mr Cameron is meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, although there are fears that Crimea has now been lost to Russia. He said: "What we have seen at this G7 meeting last night is just a growing sense that if Russia continues to behave like this it will face growing political and diplomatic isolation."Mr Cameron said the meetings with Mr Ban and Mr Xi were part of an effort to "make sure everyone is communicating this message with vigour".Asked whether there was any hope that Russia would withdraw from Crimea, he said: "I think there was a very clear consensus that what had happened was wrong and that there needed to be consequences from it, and we couldn't just accept the status quo - the new status quo."That is highlighted by the fact that the European Union has said that goods from the occupied Crimea will attract special tariffs. "There's a view that the status quo is unacceptable, but there's then another very, very strong view that any further steps into eastern Ukraine would be even more serious and would result in much greater sanctions."Women wave and a Ukrainian marine salutes Ukrainian marines in Feodosia, Crimea [AP]In the Crimean Peninsula, Ukraine ordered its troops to pull back from the disputed territory, a clear signal that at least for now the fledgling Ukrainian government in Kiev was ceding to Russia's aggressive tactics. Ukraine's Defence Minister Igor Tenyukh resigned today, despite arguing against criticism that he had failed to issue clear instructions to his country's troops.In Crimea, Ukrainian soldiers piled onto buses and began their journey to Ukrainian territory on Tuesday, as former comrades saluted them from outside a base overrun by Russian forces.  Mr Tenyukh said he had received requests to leave Crimea from about 6,500 soldiers and family members - meaning about two-thirds of the 18,800 military personnel and relatives stationed there were so far taking their chances in the peninsula newly absorbed by Russia.   "4,300 servicemen and 2,200 family members wish to continue serving in Ukraine's armed forces and will be evacuated from the autonomous republic of Crimea," Mr Tenyukh said.   Officials in Moscow, meanwhile, are warning Kiev that the country's new government may have to pay more for Russian gas, which is the main part of Ukraine's energy mix. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that the gas discount was linked to the lease deal for the Russian Black Sea fleet's presence in Crimea. Now that Crimea is part of Russia and Moscow does not have to pay for the lease, Russia sees "no reason for the discount," Mr Peskov said, quoted by Russian news agencies.  But he added that it is up to gas company Gazprom to set the price for Ukraine.
