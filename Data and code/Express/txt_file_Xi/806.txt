   Meng Hongwei's wife claims she has not heard from her 64-year-old husband since he left Lyon, France, before a trip to his native China at the end of September.The French official said Meng did arrive in China, but there was no further word on Meng's schedule - or when he was last seen.In a statement, Interpol said it was aware of reports about Meng's disappearance and added: "This is a matter for the relevant authorities in both France and China."The statement noted that Interpol's secretary general, and not its president, is responsible for the international police agency's operations.

Rights groups expressed concern at the time that Beijing might try to use Meng's position at the body to go after dissidents abroad.In July last year, Meng gave a speech on the importance of cracking down on cyber crime which observers said might reflect China's views on the issue.But diplomats say the role of interpol president is largely ceremonial, with day-to-day work carried out by its secretary general Juergen Stock and his staff.

Interpol Secretary General Juergen Stock (Image: GETTY)Local authorities in some countries have claimed however the operation has led to Chinese agents operating on their soil without prior permission.Harvard professor Juliette Kayyem took to twitter to talk about the official’s recent disappearance.She said: “Meng Hongwei is Chinese but lived in France. He went missing in last week in China and not heard from since Sept. 29?“He was a controversial pick (many groups feared he would use his position to protect China) to lead the international law enforcement agency. Curious.”
