    He said: “It unavoidably has an impact.” US President Donald Trump has long promised to clamp down on China and other exporters he argues compete unfairly with American manufacturers. On Monday, the US government imposed stiff tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. And President Trump last week threatened to issue China with big fine over alleged intellectual property theft.Beijing has made repeated pledges to reform and open up its economy and when Xi Jinping won a second term during 19th Party Congress, he spoke of proposals to give  the market more sway in the economy.Professor of Economics at Harvard University, Kenneth Rogoff said concerns were growing for China, which is showing signs of a dramatic financial collapse as it finds itself in global debt records of $233 trillion (£172 trillion). The fresh warnings come after the International Monetary Fund last December raised concerns China risks sparking a fresh global financial crisis. The IMF’s health check sent a warning around the world over the growing debt-dependency of the world’s second-biggest economy.
