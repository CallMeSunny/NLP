    Raymond Ma, portfolio manager, Fidelity International, has been covering China as an analyst and portfolio manager for more than 15 years has witnessed the development of the A-share market.Mr Ma told Express.co.uk:“The inclusion of A-shares in the MSCI indices is likely to increase the participation of foreign institutional investors. In the medium to long term, this will help the A-share market to become more sophisticated, improve liquidity and see it increasingly driven by fundamentals rather than short-term market noise."Mr Ma addes that Institutional investors tend to be more focused on finding long-term winners and thanks to ongoing consumption and industrial upgrading in China, these sectors are likely to deliver sustainable and solid growth in the next three to five years.He adds that today's news comes after a slew of measures in recent years to open up its capital markets to foreign investors that include the launching of the Stock Connect programs, the removal of foreign ownership caps for banks, allowing foreign investors to take controlling stakes in brokerage firms, futures companies and asset management companies.    The inclusion of A-shares in the MSCI indices is likely to increase the participation of foreign institutional investors.Raymond Ma, portfolio manager, Fidelity InternationalNews of China’s growing role in US markets comes after Asian shares held near one-month highs on Monday as the United States scaled-back on its trade war rhetoric.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.07 percent, on track for a third straight day of gains and within striking distance of one-month high following President Donald Trump pledge to help Chinese telecom company ZTE Corp to “get back into business, fast”.ZTE suspended its main operations earlier this month following a US ban forbidding American companies from supplying to it after the Chinese firm was found to have violated US export restrictions by illegally shipping US goods to Iran.However President Trump tweeted confirming he and Chinese President Xi Jinping are working together on a solution for ZTE.JPMorgan analysts said the move was “a significant positive”, for global markets, adding that, “this suggests that Trump might see the chance for real progress on trade talks, and is softening the US position on an issue important to China”.
