    Is bitcoin's price rising?After recent lows, Bitcoin has seen a bump in price due to endorsement in blockchain technology from the Chinese government. China’s president Xi Jinping this week discussed the potential of blockchain technology at an annual conference in the Chinese Academy of Sciences. His comments on blockchain hailed it as a “breakthrough”."A new generation of technology represented by artificial intelligence, quantum information, mobile communications, internet of things and blockchain is accelerating breakthrough applications," Xi said.   He continued by saying he will open national laboratories in order to develop and research blockchain infrastructure, so as to prepare his China for the future.The Chinese State Council’s 13th five-year economic plan, released in 2016, mentions blockchain twice. Several startups in China are partnering with local government to research and implement the technology. Bitcoin is not only the first application of blockchain but also the most well known.The technology creates a secure and permanent record of transactions between two parties - removing the requirement for a conciliator such as a bank.
