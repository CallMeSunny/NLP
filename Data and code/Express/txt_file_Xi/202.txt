    A more ambitious space station could replace the current one and act as a “transfer station” for missions to Mars, according to reports.Ms Stofan added: “To get to Mars we would need a transfer station. That means launching the modules for a Mars space ship and assembling them in an orbit around the moon.”   David Parker, director of human spaceflight and robotic exploration at the European Space Agency (ESA), pointed out the £300million a year cost of the ISS.He said: “Our plan is to free up this money from the mid-2020s to explore beyond low earth orbit… that will eventually mean de-orbiting the ISS.

GETTYChina have prioritised advancing their space programThe successful five-day refuelling, directed from technicians on Earth and completed on Thursday, is a key milestone toward China's plans to begin sending crews to a permanent space station by 2022.President Xi Jinping has prioritised advancing China's space program to strengthen national security.
