  China AidReverend's wife killed during church protest in ChinaDing Cuimei was pushed into a ditch and buried alive last week when she attempted to stop the government-ordered demolition of Beitou Church in the central Hena province city of Zhumadian.The wife of the Rev. Li Jiangong faced off with the demolition team, but they ignored her protest.Horrified congregants watched helplessly as she was buried under soil and rubble.According to the charity China Aid orders were handed down to simply go through her.The non-profit human rights and religious freedom group reported one man as saying “bury them alive for me”.The same man said he will “be responsible” for their lives and “the government wants to contain the growth of Christianity”.In the world’s most populous country the government is increasingly persecuting religious minorities, say advocates.More than two thousand crosses have now been forcefully removed from churches as part of a government campaign to regulate “excessive religious sites”. The nation’s leadership launched the crusade to eradicate Christianity in the coastal province of Zhejiang almost two years ago.   China AidDing Cuimei was found under the rubble and dirt after demolition Related articles   China tests long range missile capable of firing nukes at London   Chinese-speaking pupils ahead of British children in English  Related articles   Christian’s horror as China tears down THOUSANDS of crucifixes   Spookily human robot named Jia Jia that calls men 'lord' made in China  China has the goal of nationalising ChristiansDavid CurryDavid Curry, president and CEO of Christian advocacy group Open Doors USA told FoxNews.com: “There was a time where they [Christians] were being recognised as productive members of society. “The government treated them fairly.“But that has changed. China has the goal of nationalising Christians.”Little more than five percent of China's 1.4 billion people are believed to be Christians but still the government is accused of being determined to lower the profile of the church.Mr Curry said: “The effort takes varied forms, from rezoning church properties to allow for demolition, as in the case of the April 14 incident in which Ding was killed, to forcing pastors to meet weekly with local officials to explain their sermons.“It has had a chilling effect on religious freedom in China.”Advocates have also highlighted an effort by the government to force thousands of churches to remove crosses.  Related videos   We want to grow China: Arcadia Group's Philip Green   Bulldozer Battle on the Streets of China   The Bailong, Hundred Dragons Elevator in China   China AidBeitou Church in the central Hena province city of Zhumadian is now a dirt pileAfter Ding’s death two workers were arrested.Her husband, who was also pushed into the ditch but managed to crawl out, has allegedly been warned not to discuss the case.Bob Fu, president and founder of China Aid, said the disturbing incident underscores the serious violations against religious freedom in China that have occurred since President Xi Jinping took office in 2013. He said “He has taken a strong ideological turn to create a new cultural direction.“He [Xi] has really turned against the independent churches and any independent social movements. The government wants to contain the growth of Christianity.”More than 2,000 churches in southern China have been forced to remove crosses from their exteriors in the last year alone, according to Fu, despite them operating freely and with government permission for decades.     China AidAdvocates have said churches are being increasingly targeted by the GovernmentFu estimated that more than 500 activists and lawyers have been detained in the last year, with many still imprisoned.He said: “There is some resistance, but it is mostly passive.“There is not much the people can do in terms of going against the government.” Yulin Dog Meat Festival in China : Heartbreaking latest pictures Wed, June 20, 2018An estimated 11,000 cats and dogs are due to be slaughtered for the annual Yulin Dog Meat Festival in China Play slideshow  AFP/Getty Images1 of 21Puppies are seen in a cage at a dog meat market in Yulin, in China's southern Guangxi region

      China AidChina's Government has ordered demolition teams to take down Christian crossesAmong the arrested was prominent human rights lawyer Zhang Kai, who was detained after he mounted a legal campaign to challenge the removal of the crosses. Mr Kai was detained for six months before he was "forced" to appear on the State channel to "confess" his crimes against the Chinese Government by supporting the anti-establishment protest of the demolition of crucifixes.
