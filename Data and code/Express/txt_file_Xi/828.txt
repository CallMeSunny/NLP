  Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Hassan Rouhani are all waging "tolerance warfare", the report says (Image: GETTY)And the report has suggested "confrontation" between Russia and the West may be looming in the face of deteriorating diplomatic relations. The IISS sets out its finidngs in its report, entitled Strategic Survey 2018: The Annual Assessment of Geopolitics, published this week, making use of a concept it refers to as "tolerance warfare" to characterise the modern day landscape. Dr John Chipman, IISS Director-General, said: "Tolerance warfare is the effort to push back lines of resistance, probe weaknesses, assert rights unilaterally, break rules, establish new facts on the ground, strip others of initiative and gain systematic advantage over hesitant opponents. It particularly exploits weaknesses in Western democracies whose instincts for statecraft have been tempered by geopolitical failure abroad and constraints imposed by domestic opinion on hard-power international deployment."

They include:Launching cyber attacks to influence elections and foster domestic discord on both sides of the Atlantic, as witnessed in the 2016 US Presidential electionSpreading misinformation through media such as RT (Russia's state television network, which broadcasts internationally)Probing for vulnerabilities in Western power grids through cyber intrusionsSending military aircraft into others’ airspace with transponders turned offDeploying submarines to others’ shorelinesThe poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the UK using the chemical agent Novichok, an act carried out by two suspected Russian military-intelligence officersSeeking to destabilise the Western Balkans through covert and criminal tools, including an attempted coup in Montenegro in 2016.  China has turned many South China Sea islands, including Subi Reef, into military bases (Image: GETTY) There thus seems little prospect that Russia and the West can escape the logic of confrontation in the near futureIISS reportSpecifically addressing the Skripal assassination attempt, which indirectly resulted in the deaths of British citizens Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley, the report, prepared by a team of experts headed up by Dr Chipman, states: "The attack fits within the Kremlin's broader framing of its relations with the West as an ongoing and highly antagonistic geopolitical struggle fought across many dimensions."As with the cyber attack on the US Democratic Party, the Russian leadership has flatly rejected UK allegations of complicity, limiting the potential for dialogue."At the same time, linkage between Russia actions and US sanctions has also become blurred and the preconditions for an easing of sanctions are unclear."There thus seems little prospect that Russia and the West can escape the logic of confrontation in the near future."  Related articles   World War 3: UK at risk of 'Russian HACKING'   WORLD WAR 3: Putin threatens 'retaliation' if US pulls out of treaty   The nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei Skripal for a prime example of Russian tactics (Image: GETTY)The survey found that China was also engaged in similar tactics, most prominently in the South China Sea, with steady encroachments on islands, reefs and other geographical features it considers its own. China’s militarisation of many of the islands and implied military threats represent an attempt to intimidate regional neighbours, and are aimed at limiting their respective claims and activities in the region, the report warns. In addition, China has become more persistent in its efforts to encourage its nationals living overseas to support the national cause, its overseas influence operations prompting the Australian government, for example, to pass laws on foreign financing of politicians and political groups.   The report adds: "Iran conducts tolerance warfare in the Gulf and Levant, using partners and proxies to affect political agendas in the target states, gain a foothold for information operations and insinuate its style of warfare in neighbouring geographies."Such activities posed even greater challenges than Iran's nuclear programme, the report argues.It explains: "A confirmed nuclear-weapons would naturally pose a huge danger, including the prospect of further proliferation, but it is the political and military-influence operations of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that creates daily pressures on the regional states affected."
