There was no difference from me and my brothers and I think as a business leader you saw that and as a President you will absolutely see that.”     REUTERSIvanka Trump style: The gala dinner took place at Deutsche BankOne of Ivanka’s last appearances was as she was arriving at Palm Beach International Airport for a weekend with Chinese President Xi Jinping, with a lot more skin on show than previous outings. Pictured with her three children, Ivanka appeared in good spirits, wearing a chevron design polo neck top, a pastel blue skirt and grey stiletto heels. She finished off the outfit with a pair of gold-rimmed sunglasses and gold hoop earrings. The 35-year-old had her legs on show, having opted for wide-leg trousers on recent outings.
