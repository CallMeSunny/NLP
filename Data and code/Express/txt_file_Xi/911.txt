   Beijing and Washington have been embroiled in a bitter trade war since July, with the economic dispute showing no signs of abating.US leader Donald Trump intensified the row earlier this month by imposing a 10 percent tariff on £152bn ($200bn) of Chinese imports.China, which has refused to back down in the trade war, retaliated by slapping tariffs on £45bn ($60bn) of American goods.Credit insurance firm Euler Hermes warned of the impact on global trade if the superpowers fail to agree to a deal by next year.
