   The new White House report, titled "How China's Economic Aggression Threatens the Technologies and Intellectual Property of the United States and the World" followed President Trump's additional tariffs on goods from China.The emerging trade war between the two powerhouses cameer Trump revealed on Monday that he had requested the United States Trade Representative to identify $200billion (£151billion) worth of Chinese goods for additional tariffs at a rate of 10 percent.President Trump said of the proposed measures: “I have directed the United States Trade Representative to identify $200billion worth of Chinese goods for additional tariffs at a rate of 10 percent.“After the legal process is complete, these tariffs will go into effect if China refuses to change its practices, and also if it insists on going forward with the new tariffs that it has recently announced.” Related articles   Trump demands tariffs on $200billion of Chinese goods    TRADE WAR: Trump to HIT China with ANOTHER $200 billion tariffs spa... In the opening of the report, the White House said: "China has experienced rapid economic growth to become the world's second largest economy while modernising its industrial base and moving up the global value chain."However, much of this growth has been achieved in significant part through aggressive acts, policies, and practices that fall outside of global norms and rules (collectively, 'economic aggression')."And hinting at previous accusations of Chinese made technology proposing security concerns in the US - which saw ZTE phones being banned from shops – the White House further described practices through which China "seeks to access the crown jewels of American technology and intellectual property."The new tariffs have again set off market turmoil.

The policies highlighted in the report include foreign ownership restriction, strict administrative approvals and licensing requirements, discriminatory patent and other intellectual property rights restrictions.In conclusion, the damning report on China said: "Given the size of China's economy, the demonstrable extent of its market-distorting policies, and China's stated intent to dominate the industries of the future."China's acts, policies, and practices of economic aggression now targeting the technologies and [intellectual property] of the world threaten not only the U.S. economy but also the global innovation system as a whole."Since Trump announced he was seeking to impose further tariffs, Beijing said China will protect its interests and is prepared to fight back against the punitive measures.
