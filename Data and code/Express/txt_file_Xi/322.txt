 The Tiankun dredger is capable of smashing up enough rock from the sea bed to fill three olympic swimming pools every hour.The Chinese ship can then shoot the debris 15 miles away to create entirely new islands, allowing Beijing to lay claim to territory in the South China sea.The Communist nation currently claims it owns 85 per cent of the maritime region, however Brunei, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam all believe China is encroaching on their territory.Free access to the South China Sea is also vital for other countries including the US, with approximately £3.8trillion of trade passing through the region.

    Last month China hit out at the Trump administration after three US officials confirmed the USS Chafee, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, passed the Paracel islands to challenge "excessive maritime claims" in the south China sea.China has described previous US decisions to sail through the waters as behaviour that “threatened the sovereignty of the South China Sea countries”.In September Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said: “For some time now, some countries have used the pretext of freedom of navigation to bring their planes and fleets near the South China Sea."Actually, I think this is behaviour that has threatened the sovereignty of South China Sea countries.”Related articles   Trump brands US-China trade deficit ‘embarrassing’ ahead of Asia visit  Donald Trump's Asia tour: President warned US safety depends on China  China wants HEGEMONY: Steve Bannon warns Donald Trump ahead of Asia...
