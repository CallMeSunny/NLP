 The outspoken Republican is calling on allies and international partners to stamp out the threat of World War 3 following repeated sabre rattling by the Hermit Kingdom’s young dictator.The President’s tour has taken him through the corridors of power in South Korea, which fears the wrath of the DPRK’s “rocket man”.And despite tough talk on Russia and China, President Trump is expected to meet with Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, two of the world’s most powerful leaders with key links to the Kim regime.But can the ‘Art of the Deal’ author call on his international counterparts to bring an end to threats of World War 3?

Vladimir Putin (Russia)Tensions between President Trump and Vladimir Putin have flared up since the US election, when the former property mogul vowed to reach out to the Russian strongman.Increased scrutiny over the Trump Administration’s ties to Russia have also driven a wedge between the two leaders.But Russia could provide key leverage in the battle to convince Kim Jong-un to disarm – and the two could strike a key deal when they meet on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Danang, Vietnam.What can Russia do? Russia have long claimed applying political pressure on North Korea is a wasted effort.In an article released by the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin wrote: “Russia believes that the policy of putting pressure on Pyongyang to stop its nuclear missile program is misguided and futile."Provocations, pressure and militarist and insulting rhetoric are a dead-end road."However the influence of Moscow carries weight in Pyongyang following Russia’s decision to write off $10billion dollars of debt owed from the Soviet era.

    Putin could use his leverage to neutralise the DPRK threat and project himself as an international player and peacemaker in a bid to clean up his harsh global image.Samuel Ramani, a Russian foreign policy specialist, said: “As Russia takes an increasingly assertive approach to world affairs, it reminds its citizens of the Soviet Union's status as a superpower that could influence conflicts worldwide."In this respect, Russia's increased attention to North Korea is much like its military intervention in Syria and its expanded diplomatic presence in Libya and Afghanistan. “Moscow is trying once again to project itself as a global power."What does Russia want?Following interference from Russia in the 2016 US election Donald Trump introduced fresh sanctions against Moscow – which he could offer to lift in return for Putin’s help in tackling Kim.The sanctions can target individuals who invest in Russian energy, provide military support to Moscow’s allies or invest $10million or more in Russian government industries.  GETTYRussia could provide key leverage in the battle to convince Kim Jong-un to disarmXi Jinping (China)During his election campaign over a year ago Trump threatened to brand China a currency manipulator, and accused them of “raping” the US with Beijing-friendly trade deals.But since ascending to the White House the US President has softened his stance on Chinese figurehead Xi Jinping, heralding their “close” relationship.During Trump’s time in office Xi has consolidated even more control over the communist state, becoming one of the most powerful Chinese leader’s since Chairman Mao.What can China do?China is North Korea’s largest trade partner, keeping the tiny state financially afloat amid ever increasing sanctions.Trump claimed China “can fix this problem easily – and quickly” by leveraging political pressure on the hermit Kingdom.Former national policy adviser Victor Cha said: “For decades, China has played a smoke-and-mirrors game on North Korea that traps the U.S. in doomed negotiations that spare Beijing a near-term crisis on its border, but kicks the can down the road on the larger problem.“The US should get China to step up and pay directly for the denuclearisation of North Korea. “China’s payments designed to prop up Pyongyang must be tied directly to nuclear inspections, and ultimately to denuclearisation and not to China’s economic interests.” Korean Demilitarized Zone: The world's most dangerous border Tue, November 7, 2017Established by the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement to serve as a buffer zone between North Korea and South Korea Play slideshow  AFP/Getty Images1 of 10A South Korean tank of the 8th Mechanized Infantry Division takes part in a live-fire exercise at a training ground in Cheorwon, near the demilitarized zone (DMZ)

    What does China want?China is striking a new path in the world as it emerges as a global superpower under the leadership of President Xi.It currently has a large trade surplus with the US – something Trump has vowed to stamp out during his presidency.But he may be forced to ease off his tough rhetoric towards Beijing in return for dealing with the North Korean crisis – which would also help China to continue to show its ability to influence global events as well as removing a volatile threat from their border.Trump could also recognise Beijing’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, a region that is also claimed by several other countries and is regularly passed through by the US navy in a bid to undermine China’s island land grab.  GETTYXi has consolidated even more control over the communist state in recent weeksMoon Jae-in (South Korea)South Korean President Moon Jae in was elected into Seoul’s Blue House after campaigning to open dialogue with Kim Jong-un and turn away from the US.He once claimed he would never “kowtow to the Americans”, and wrote in a book published earlier this year it was time for South Korea to “say no to the Americans”.But so far the South Korean President has shown close ties to the US figurehead.What can South Korea do? South Korea does not have the heavyweight economic and military leverage carried by China and Russia – however it is sill a key part of any talks on the peninsula.Any deal that opens up the hermit kingdom would likely need South Korea to have a seat at the table, making keeping it on side vital for anyone hoping to bring about a North Korea solution.

      GETTYSouth Korea is one of the US’ strongest allies and offers the US military accessMeanwhile the small nation, with its booming economic growth, is one of the US’ strongest allies and offers the US military access to the region.What does South Korea want? Living under the shadow of Kim Jong-un’s nuclear nightmare has been a major issue for South Korea since the tyrant rose to power at the end of 2011.It could ask Trump to show more support for Moon Jae-in’s policy of negotiation with Kim Jong-un – with the US President previously blasted as “appeasement”.Moon’s inability to control North Korea or Trump’s exchanges in fierce rhetoric, as well as Kim’s repeated nuclear tests, have reportedly led to questions over his ability to govern.Political analyst Bong Young-shi said: “President Trump might have felt frustration about a seemingly softer stance from the South Korean leadership, but at the same time the Trump administration also agrees that military options are way too risky.”Related articles   WORLD WAR 3: North Korea - New nuclear missile 'could reach UK'  World War 3: Top general wants ‘MILITARY CAPABILITIES’ for Kim Jong Un  Donald Trump levels chilling World War 3 threat at North Korea
