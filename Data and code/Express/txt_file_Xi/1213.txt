Tightening sanctions can be useful in increasing pressure on North Korea, but sanctions alone will not solve the problem.“Pyongyang has shown it can make progress on missile and nuclear technology despite its isolation. Without a diplomatic effort to stop its progress, there is little doubt that it will develop a long–range missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead to the US.” North Korea as you've never seen before through these stunning pictures Tue, June 13, 2017These incredible photographs, which offer a unique glimpse behind the veil, were taken on a trip to the country by web designer Reuben Teo Play slideshow  Reuben Teo / mediadrumworld.com1 of 10Pyongyang

    Wednesday January 289pm US citizens could have their travel restricted to North Korea following the death of Otto Warmbier. Republican Joe Wilson and Democrat Adam Schiff, have introduced legislation to ban tourist travel to North Korea, which could receive a vote as soon as next month.  7.45pm US F-16fighter jets stationed in South Korea and Japanese F-35s are set to receive a raft of long-range missiles to combat the potential North Korean threat.The US Air Force in the Korean Peninsula is strengthening its offensive arsenal with 10 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles, or JASSMs.These deadly warheads could strike a target almost 200 miles away with the power of 2,000 pounds of explosives.Meanwhile Japanese fighters will be upgraded with the stealthy Joint Strike Missiles (JSMs), which carry a 500 pound warhead and can fly just a few yards above the ground.3.30pm South Korea's spy agency said it was "unpardonable" that North Korea made threats against its citizens after the North issued a standing order to execute the former leader of the South for a purported assassination plot.3pm North Korea issued a standing order for the execution of former South Korean President Park Geun-hye and her spy chief for a plot to assassinate its leader, and it demanded that the South hand the pair over.1.30pm The North Korea will be at the top of the agenda when South Korean President Moon Jae-in visits the White House tomorrow.  US President Donald Trump has invited the South Korean leader to discuss the nuclear threat posed by Kim Jong-un’s regime. 11am US Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, who arrived in Beijing on Tuesday, spoke reporters outside his residence on Wednesday and said the US hoped to collaborate with China."We need to work together to deal with some of the pressing, difficult issues, such as the threat from North Korea. We want to work together to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula," he said.Last week Mr Trump tweeted: "While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!"The US President had made a grand gesture of his desire for warm ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping when he played host to Xi in April at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach, Florida."I think China will be stepping up," Trump said at the time.10.30am The United States is growing increasingly concerned that Russia could provide support for North Korea to fill any void left by China, according to US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley."I'm concerned that Russia may backfill North Korea," Mrs Haley told lawmakers in Washington. "We don't have proof of that, but we are watching that carefully."She added: "We just need to keep the pressure on China, we need to keep our eyes on Russia, and we need to continue to let the North Korean regime know we are not looking for regime change ... we just want them to stop the nuclear activity.”9.30am The US yesterday placed China on its global list of worst offenders in human trafficking and forced labour. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has dropped China to ‘tier three', the lowest grade, alongside Iran, North Korea and Syria.Mr Tillerson pressed China to ramp up economic and political pressure on North Korea during his meeting with top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Washington last week.8.30am Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have called North Korea's pursuit of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes a "grave threat" to global peace.The world leaders pledged to work together to counter the ”weapons of mass destruction" programmes and vowed to hold "all parties" that support these programmes accountable, a White House statement said.
