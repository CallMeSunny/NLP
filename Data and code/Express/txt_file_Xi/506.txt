   The ceremonial niceties were marred by undiplomatic shouting on the tarmac as the US president embarked on a final bout of delicate overseas diplomacy before his successor is elected in November.The stakes are high for China to pull off a trouble-free G20 summit of the world's top economies, its highest profile event of the year, as it looks to cement its global standing and avoid acrimony over a long list of tensions with Washington.But in an unusual altercation as China implement strict controls ahead of the big summit, a Chinese official attempted to prevent Mr Obama’s national security adviser Susan Rice from walking to the motorcade as she crossed a media rope line.He spoke angrily to her because a Secret Service agent was forced to step in between the two.

     This is our country. This is our airportPointing, he angrily shouted: “This is our country. This is our airport.”The same official shouted at a White House press aide who was instructing foreign reporters on where to stand as Mr Obama disembarked from the plane. Moments afterwards the US President's motorcade was rolling away, towards a city of nine million people.The awkward incident is an illustration of the image-conscious ruling Communist Party’s efforts to control the media as it looks to orchestrate what it hopes will be a flawless event.China has undertaken extensive security measures in preparation for the G20 Summit, which opens on Sunday.On Saturday, many roads and shops in Hangzhou were deserted in the usually bustling city. The Chinese government has broad control over domestic media and prevents many foreign media outlets from publishing in the country, including by blocking their websites.  REUTERS Chinese President Xi Jinping (C), UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and U.S. President Barack Obama Mr Obama has raised issues of freedom of the press on previous visits to China, whereby he has insisted that media must follow the party line and promote "positive propaganda".Foreign reporters are often physically prevented from covering sensitive stories, but altercations involving foreign government officials are rare.It was unclear if the official, whose name was not immediately clear, knew that Ms Rice was a senior official and not a reporter.
