   Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ruling Communist party recently announced it was eliminating the two-term limit for the presidency, paving the way for Xi to serve indefinitely.According to an audio of Trump’s closed-door fundraiser in Florida, the President said: "He's now president for life, president for life. And he's great."And look, he was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot someday.”US Presidents by tradition served a maximum of two four-year terms until President Franklin Roosevelt was elected a record four times starting in 1932.An amendment to the US Constitution approved in 1951 limits presidents to two terms in office.

US Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat, said on Twitter: “Whether this was a joke or not, talking about being President for life like Xi Jinping is the most unAmerican sentiment expressed by an American President. George Washington would roll over in his grave."In order to change the current prohibition, it would require the initial support of two-thirds of both houses of Congress or support of two-thirds of state legislatures - and then would need to be ratified by three-quarters of the states.China's annual parliament gathering kicks off on Monday as Xi presses ahead with efforts to ward off financial risks without undermining the economy.The Communist party announced on Feb 25 the end of the two-term limit for the president - and the parliament is expected to ratify the move.During the remarks, Trump praised Xi as "a great gentleman" and added: "He's the most powerful (Chinese) president in a hundred years."

    Trump said Xi had treated him "tremendously well" during his visit in November.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Saturday.Trump has often praised Xi, but in January Trump claimed the US was considering a big "fine" as part of a probe into China's alleged theft of intellectual property.   He has been critical of China's trade policies.Trump said in December that because of North Korea he had "been soft on China because the only thing more important to me than trade is war”.Appearing on BBC Newsnight Steve Tsang, Director of the SOAS China Institute, claimed the most powerful man in China was only interested in staying on beyond a second term in the role so that he could continue to go on state visits.  GETTYTrump has previously asked China to do more to curb North Korean missile ambitionsExplaining why Xi Jinping would be interested in remaining President after the end of his second term, Mr Tsang said: “I think he’s doing it for two reasons.“One, he’s doing it now because he can.“He’s got to a point where he’s consolidated his position, he’s in a sweet spot, and the resistance within the party is not going to be able to stop him.“He also likes the idea that after the year 2023, he can still go on formal state visits.”Worried locals compared the decision to the neighbouring hermit kingdom North Korea.One Weibo user, where the Kim dynasty has ruled since the late 1940s, said: "Argh, we're going to become North Korea."Another user wrote: "We're following the example of our neighbour."The comments were removed late on Sunday after Weibo, China's answer to Twitter, began blocking the search term "two term limit".
