    Photos from the meeting show Mr Trump grimacing, wrestling and laughing alongside his counterparts also taking part.The US President appeared befuddled by the master of ceremonies request to begin the “traditional” handshake.The MC said: “Give us your brightest smile. It’s the ASEAN handshake: right hand over left.”Russian Prime Minister Mr Medvedev, however, was less than convinced by the event, refusing to cross his arms when linking hands.
