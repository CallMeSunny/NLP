   The President will speak to US and South Korean troops at Camp Humphreys, 55 miles south of Seoul but he is reportedly unlikely to visit the Korean demilitarised zone - a heavily guarded strip of land that divides the North and South - on the advice of President Moon Jae-in.It is feared that Trump’s presence will spark further tensions between the US and North Korea who have been engaged in a war of words with Trump threatening “fire and fury” against Pyongyang.A senior White House official defending Trump's tough stance, said: “If we fail to confront and reverse the threat from North Korea we’re going to be living in a much darker era.“The president’s rhetoric, and more importantly his actions, have led to the most substantial shift and progress by the international community in confronting this threat than we’ve seen over the past several administrations.”  GETTYDonald Trump and Kim Jong-un have been engaging in a war of words Related articles   Retired US Major General slates Channel 4 host saying Trump is RIGHT   World War 3: USA has ‘NO COHERENT PLAN’ to deal with North Korea The White House and the United Nations have increased economic sanctions on North Korea while the President has escalated his rhetoricIn a UN speech last month Trump threaten he would “totally destroy” the North if necessary.The White House official said the US has tried for 25-years to negotiate a “good faith” agreement with North Korea to rein in its nuclear ambitions and create a productive diplomatic dialogue.He said: “At every turn, the US has been cheated, the world has been tricked, the UN has been humiliated.“This administration made a good-faith effort to signal to North Korea that our door was open to dialogue.... That olive branch was returned with roughly 20 ballistic missile tests, including a couple launched over Japan; ICBM tests; the test of a large nuclear device; the death of an American hostage; two more hostages — there are now three in North Korea — and the assassination of Kim's half brother at an international airport using a nerve agent."Since Ronald Reagan, every president except George H W Bush has visited the demilitarised zone.
