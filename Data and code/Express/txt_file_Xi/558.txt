  GETTYKim Jong-un is attempting to acquire nuclear weaponsAmerican forces could look to launch a "surgical strike" against North Korean army installations as the reclusive rogue state gets closer to acquiring serious nuclear capabilities. But John Delury, an expert on China, warned that Beijing would feel compelled to defend its crackpot neighbour in such a scenario even though Chinese officials have become increasingly exasperated with its insane leader.  Related articles   Kim Jong-un warns South Korea of 'EXTREME CONFRONTATION'   Kim Jong-un killed his wife? Fears grow as Ri Sol-ju remains hidden North Korea is technically China's only military ally, with the two Communist states having signed a defence treaty guaranteeing that they would leap to each other's defence in the event of an attack.And although Beijing has tried to distance itself from the 1961 pact, Dr Delury said he believes a military strike so close to home would force the military superpower to retaliate.   GETTYA military expert has warned any attempt to stop him could spark war with China  GETTYKim recently wrote to Chinese premier Xi Jinping to reaffirm the countries' defence treatyHe said: "How might Beijing react to a US pre-emptive or surgical strike on the North?"North Korea is, after all, China's only defence treaty ally in the world, and is obligated to 'immediately render military and other assistance by all means at its disposal' to defend Pyongyang if attacked."Writing for the 38 North think tank Dr Delury, an assistant professor at Seoul's Yonsei University, added: "If the United States launches a pre-emptive strike not to prevent a specific, imminent missile attack, but rather to prevent North Korea from perfecting an intercontinental nuclear strike capability, it is unlikely to meet Beijing's standard for jus ad bellum (right to war)."On the contrary, a strike of this nature could likely drive Beijing to side with the North in accordance with their 1961 treaty."'Surgery' would rapidly descend into a bloodbath. 'Pre-emption' would start a war."   North Korea recently confirmed it is still committed to its defence treaty with China, with its madcap leader praising it as having a "firm legal foundation" in a message to Chinese President Xi Jinping to mark the treaty's 55th anniversary earlier this year.And despite China's concerns about loony Kim's military programme the country is still committed to dialogue with Pyongyang believing that diplomatic pressure, and not military action, is the best way to keep him under control. Dr Delury added Beijing firmly believes that no amount of sanctions against the rogue state and its tinpot leader will persuade him to abandon his nuclear programme.  Kim Jong-un in pictures Sun, January 7, 2018Kim Jong-Un, The Supreme Leader of North Korea takes himself and his leadership very seriously.

    He said: "The firm policy of the Chinese government, supported by most foreign policy experts, is that only dialogue and negotiation can moderate North Korea's behaviour, and that the best hope for long-term progress lies in the untapped potential of North Korea's economic transformation and regional integration. "If the next US president adopts an engagement strategy, Xi Jinping's government would likely step up its own work to achieve short-term breakthroughs and long-term solutions. "Paradoxically, Washington's best chance of getting China to apply constructive pressure on its errant neighbor is through a major U.S. initiative to negotiate with Kim Jong-un."
