   Rear Admiral Lou Yuan told an audience in Shenzhen that “what the United States fears the most is taking casualties” before declaring that destroying one of its supercarriers would kill 5,000 navy personnel. Bragging about China’s anti-shop missile capabilities, Lou added that sinking two carriers would double that figure, the New York-based Epoch Times reports. He told a top military summit: “We’ll see how frightened America is.” Related articles   Trade war SHOCK: Trump tariffs cost US and China $6BILLION in 2018   WW3: ‘Miscalculation’ may catapult West and Russia into catastrophe In the wide-ranging speech on December 20, Lou discussed China-US relations and the escalating trade war between Washington and Bejing.The military academic went on to insist that the trade spat was “definitely not simply friction over economics and trade”, warning that the conflict was instead a “prime strategic issue”.China is continuing to flex its muscles in East Asia, expanding its influence in the East China Sea and strengthening its claims over the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.US warships are deployed in the region with the aim of monitoring Chinese expansion and vessels from the rival nations have come close to colliding with each other in recent months.
