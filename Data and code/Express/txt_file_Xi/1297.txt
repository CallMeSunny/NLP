From Russian interference in the 2016 election, to his former lawyer sent to prison following raids and even the former businessman’s hard-line approach to immigration, the firebrand president has remained a constant across the news in 2018. With a growing focus on trade deals that have led the US to the edge of economic wars with China, Iran and at one point, Europe, President Trump’s first term in office as so far as never been far from high drama. His opposition to the EU and his demand for defence spending targets to reach agreed Nato requirements point to another tense 12 months for the Republican president. The drama is expected to continue as he draws close towards the end of his first term in the Oval office.   World leaders 2019: The Russian strongman is showing might on a global scale (Image: GETTY)Vladimir PutinLoved by his nation and feared by others, the former KGB head and Russian premiere has been no stranger to headlines in 2018.The Russian president’s involvement in collusion on the US presidential elections caused panic across the world.Mr Putin has ordered several military exercises, displaying Russian might, while the country’s involvement in supporting Syrian president Bashar al-Assad continues to crop up in headlines.But it is the recent reopening of tensions with the Ukraine, which saw a Russian naval ship attack three Ukrainian vessels on the contested Crimean sea that sparked international outrage.The hard-line president has refused to release the sailors – all the while the Russian military ae testing new weapons and heightening fears of World War Three breaking out.  World leaders 2019: Xi Jinping is mixing Chinese and Western tradition (Image: GETTY)Xi JinpingThe Chinese premiere has hailed a new era in modern day China, juxtaposing strict national traditions with rapidly developing modernism.For example, three new multiplex cinemas are erected every day in the People’s Democratic Republic of China.But the country’s population is still heavily censored, with freedom of speech remaining a highly sought-after freedom for citizens living in the Asian superpower.Reports of joint exercises with Russia, allegations of state-owned technology firms spying on Britain and the US and a n increase in the persecution of Christians living in China are some of the headlines that have surrounded the Chinese leader.

World leaders 2019: Mrs May faces a tough year before and after Brexit day (Image: GETTY)Theresa MayThe embattled British Prime Minister was handed the results of the EU referendum by former British Prime Minister David Cameron in 2016.Prime Minister May has had one of the toughest jobs in British politics since the Second World War, negotiating and attempting to sell a deal that has prompted detractions from all sides of the political spectrum.Her own future is in doubt following the UK’s exit from the European Union bloc in march 29, 2019 after surviving December’s vote of confidence in Parliament – meaning her position in office is safe for at least another year.But with strong opposition from the EU27 regarding further amendments to her criticsed Withdrawal Agreement, and the increasing likelihood that her deal will be rejected by Parliament when the Meaningful Vite takes place on January 21, her aspirations to see out the job – and guide the UK through a potential no-deal Brexit – adds to her position as one of the world’s most important leaders in 2019.Europe – and the world at large – will look to the Prime Minister to set the agenda for future trade deals, political policies, and the future of the British public as a whole.  World leaders 2019: Akesson holds the sway of the future of Swedish politics (Image: GETTY)Jimmie Akesson Often referred to as the acceptable face of right-wing politics, the rise of Jimmie Akesson and his Sweden Democrats party has seen the country plunged into political crisis. Nearly four months on from the national Swedish elections, the country remains in a fierce deadlock – and without a government. His party became the third largest party in Sweden with 62 out of in total 349 seats in the Swedish parliament  The SD now hold the balance of power following the general election on September 9 - piling pressure on mainstream Swedish parties to join a coalition with anti-immigration Sweden Democrats. The SD party’s success in the election stopped Stefan Löfven’s centre-left Social Democrats (SAP) and the centre-right Sweden Moderates party (M), led by Ulf Kristersson, from claiming a majority. None of the mainstream parties wish to join forces with the hard-right SD party - who is said to have its roots in the white supremacist fringe. A partnership with the SD party would be the only way to form a government, who have seen their support rise to 18.3 percent, a figure up from 17.5 percent in the September elections. The 2018 elections are one of the most complicated in Sweden's history. As the deadlock looks set to pass through to the new year, all eyes will be on the anti-immigration leader – and respective party leaders – to take Sweden out of its darkest political period in over 40 years.   World leaders 2019: Mr Varadkar will remain a prominent figure in politics after Brexit (Image: GETTY)Leo VaradkarThe Irish Taioseach could hold the power to bring down the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Mr Varadkar has never been far away from controversy in Ireland, having made a series of remarks on the country's complex political landscape.A firm supporter and ally of Theresa May, the Irish Prime Minister has said he supports Theresa May’s Brexit Withdrawal deal – but warned that the issue of the Irish border “could not be ignored”.If the issue of the Irish border is not resolved before Brexit day in March 2019, then the hard border between Northern and southern Ireland could dissolve, resulting in a “united Ireland”, with Britain losing sovereignty over the territory.The Taoiseach's offered a belated olive branch to Northern unionists and Arlene Foster’s DUP, which props up Theresa May’s Conservative government. But his approach to politics has divided the Republic  World leaders 2019: Mr Salvini plans to take his hard brand of populism across Europe (Image: GETTY)Matteo SalviniThe Italian Eurosceptic leader of the right-wing Lega party has emerged as his country's fastest rising political star.Mr Salvini, along with populist leaders in Austria, France and Holland, will be seeking a unified eurosceptic bloc, as he continues to rise as Italy's most prominent leader - despite not even being the country's Prime MinisterAs party leaders struggled to form a government over issues such as immigration, the Italian govermnet was fomred by a coaltion featuring the anti-establishment 5Star Movement.Since then Mr Salvini has been seen as one of Europe's leading populist leaders, furiously defending the rights of Italian citizens and rebuffing theadvances of the European Commission on issues such as budgets, migration and bloc wide laws.With voters across the Continent headed to ballot boxes in May to choose the next European Parliament — and by extension the next crop of EU officials — the 45-year-old interior minister is using his national prominence to whip up support for a nationalist march on Brussels.
