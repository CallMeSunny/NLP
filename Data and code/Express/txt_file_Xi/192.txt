  GETTYPresident Xi Jinping has claimed China loves peace but will not back down to any enemyWhile North Korea’s Kim Jong-un threatens to spark war with missile tests off Japan, and territorial tensions in the South China Sea show no signs of let up.But China has furiously rejected claims it is not in control.Angry at the latest Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) test, after claims a warhead could hit mainland US, Donald Trump blasted China on Twitter.The President said the neighbours of the hermit North Korea were not doing enough to stop its rapidly growing nuclear programme.President Xi Jinping has promoted peace and opted for economic sanctions thus far - but as he revealed his gigantic army on Sunday, the world payed attention.Marking 90 years since the founding of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) thousands of troops were marched through Zhurihe military training base in Inner Mongolia.  EPAChina rolled out its massive military on Sunday in a celebratory paradeToday, he said this mighty military would never be intimidated.He said: "No one should expect us to swallow the bitter fruit that is harmful to our sovereignty, security or development interests"We will never allow any people, organisation or political party to split any part of Chinese territory out of the country at any time, in any form."The Chinese people love peace. We will never seek aggression or expansion, but we have the confidence to defeat all invasions.”China has rattled nerves around Asia and globally with its increasingly assertive stance in territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas and an ambitious military modernisation plan.Relations with self-ruled Taiwan have also worsened since Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party won presidential elections there last year. China considers Taiwan a wayward province, to be brought under Beijing's control by force if necessary.Xi, speaking at the Great Hall of the People, made no direct reference to any particular territorial dispute, as he sought to assure that China's intentions were peaceful, but also show that the nation would not be bullied.The army has been a central target of Xi's wide-ranging anti-corruption campaign, with several senior military officers, including Xu Caihou, Guo Boxiong and Gu Junshan, being felled for graft since Xi came to power.

        The People's Army must be brave enough to change and innovate, not at any time must it become rigid or stagnateXi JinpingChina has not fought a war in decades and the government insists it has no hostile intent, but simply needs the ability to properly defend the world's second-largest economy.China's armed forces, the world's largest, are in the midst of an ambitious modernisation program, which includes investment in technology and new equipment, such as stealth fighters and aircraft carriers, as well as cuts to troop numbers.Xi said: “The People's Army must be brave enough to change and innovate, not at any time must it become rigid or stagnate.”Some of the military reforms have been controversial at home. Sources with ties to the military say Xi's announcement at the 2015 parade to cut 300,000 troops has caused unease within the ranks.On Sunday, Xi presided over a large military parade at the remote Zhurihe training base in China's northern Inner Mongolia region, where he inspected troops from the back of a jeep.
