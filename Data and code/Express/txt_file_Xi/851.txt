   President Trump heads to Warsaw today where the White House said he would showcase his commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in a speech and in meetings with a group of nations closest to Russia on his way to the G20 summit in Germany on Friday and Saturday. “He will lay out a vision not only for America's future relationship with Europe, but the future of our trans-Atlantic alliance, and what that means for American security and American prosperity,” President Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, told reporters last week. Aside from shoring up the US relationship with Nato allies, the speech is symbolically significant given Poland's proximity to Russia and regional fears about Moscow's ambitions following its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.   GETTYDonald Trump’s chance to make friends in Europe ahead of G20 summit  Related articles   May stuns Corbyn with stern warning Labour could turn UK in Greece   Trump on collision course with Brussels again over Apple tax case  They have spent a lot of their time trying to undo or explain away some of the images and the mood that came out of the last trip to EuropeDerek CholletIt was only six weeks ago when President Trump, meeting Nato leaders in Brussels, scolded them for failing to spend enough on defence during a speech in which the Republican president was expected to explicitly endorse Nato's Article 5, the collective defence provision of the treaty. He slammed Germany for its trade practices, and shortly after returning home, pulled out of the 2015 Paris climate deal, leaving his officials to try to smooth ruffled feelings. “They have spent a lot of their time trying to undo or explain away some of the images and the mood that came out of the last trip to Europe,” said Derek Chollet, a top defence official for President Barack Obama.   GETTYMr Trump will meet for the second time Chinese President Xi JinpingGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, the host of the Group of 20 meeting of leading economies, has signalled she will not back down on climate and trade. That is not the only tough meeting for President Trump during his trip. He will meet for the second time Chinese President Xi Jinping, with whom he has expressed some frustration for failing to use enough leverage to curb North Korea's nuclear program. Pyongyang said on Tuesday it successfully test-launched a newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile, which analysts said could put all of the US state of Alaska in range for the first time.  NATO meets Donald Trump months after he described it ‘obsolete’ Wed, April 12, 2017The White House says the President will use the meeting as an opportunity to reaffirm his commitment to NATO Play slideshow  REUTERS1 of 7U.S.  President Trump meets with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg at the White House in Washington

    President Trump is under pressure at home to take a tough line in his first face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on issues such as Moscow's support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war and allegations of Russian meddling in last year's US election. But first, there is Poland: a Nato member near Russia that meets its defence spending goals, hosts close to 1,000 US troops and is eager to buy liquefied natural gas from US companies to counterbalance Russian gas supplies in the region.“The threat that Russia poses cannot be overstated,” Poland's ambassador to the United States, Piotr Wilczek, told reporters last week. “Now is the time for allied solidarity,” Wilczek said.
