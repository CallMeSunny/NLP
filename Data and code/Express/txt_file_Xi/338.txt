   North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in the early hours of Tuesday morning, marking a paradigm shift in the rogue state’s capabilities.The ICBM as “lofted” at a steep trajectory and reached an altitude of 2,802 km (1,741 miles) before landing in the Sea of Japan.Analysts have said that the warhead could be capable of targeting Alaska.Hours after the test, the US an South Korea staged a joint missile drill in a major show of force."The drills showcased precision targeting of the enemy's leadership in case of an emergency," a South Korean Defence Ministry statement said.The exercise defied calls from China and Russia for an end to US-South Korea military exercises.Bejing and Moscow issued a joint statement urging North Korea to end its weapons programme in return for a moratorium on drills by the two powers.

China China has traditionally been North Korea’s closest ally, but has condemned the latest missile test as "unacceptable”.In a joint statement, President Xi Jinping vowed to work with Russian President Vladimir Putin on diplomatic approach to the Korean problem.North Korea has historically enjoyed strong links with China, its neighbour to the north and the west. But since Kim took power in 2011, the relationship has cooled.Chinese President Xi Jinping is said to have a low opinion of Kim and his nuclear weapons programme. Beijing has repeatedly asked Pyongyang to cease its nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches in vain.In February North Korean state media accused Beijing of “dancing to the tune of the US” and “styling itself as a big power” after China suspended all coal imports from North Korea for the rest of the year.“Its recent measures are, in effect, tantamount to the enemies’ moves to bring down the social system,” the report said.Beijing said that the ban was designed to enforce UN sanctions aimed at ending Kim's nuclear weapons programme, but China has stopped short of blocking food and energy supplies to North Korea.

North Korea state could begin to unravelTed Galen Carpenter“Such a course would require China to incur tremendous risks, and Chinese policymakers are understandably reluctant to do so,” Mr Carpenter wrote. “They have a number of plausible worries about taking such actions. One is that the North Korean state could begin to unravel. At a minimum, that would mean a massive flow of refugees into China. “Indeed, given the landmines and other massive military impediments along both sides of the Demilitarised Zone separating the two Koreas, it would be easier for refugees to flee to China than to South Korea.”MAPPED: THE WORLD'S NUCLEAR POWERS Inside North Korea: The pictures Kim Jong-un doesn't want you to see Thu, March 8, 2018Photographer Eric Lafforgue ventured to North Korea six times.

    RussiaRussia’s relations with the US are at their worst since the end of the Cold War, its foreign ministry has said, so it comes as no surprise that Moscow has remained silent on the current US-North Korea situation.North Korea shares a narrow north-easternly border with Russia, and the two nations have been close allies since the Cold War.Last year Russia warned North Korea that its continued nuclear threats could lead to international military force being used against the hermit regime, after Pyongyang threatened to “annihilate” the US and South Korea.“We consider it to be absolutely impermissible to make public statements containing threats to deliver some ‘preventive nuclear strikes’ against opponents,” Moscow said.“Pyongyang should be aware of the fact that in this way the DPRK will become fully opposed to the international community and will create international legal grounds for using military force against itself in accordance with the right of a state to self-defence enshrined in the United Nations Charter.”  GETTYVladimir Putin has extended a hand of friendship to Kim Jong-un in recent yearsThe statement was interpreted by many as a generic warning rather than a promise of Russian intervention.Moscow also took the opportunity to criticise a joint US-South Korea military exercise which it said put “unprecedented military and political pressure on Pyongyang”.In 2015 Russia and North Korea declared a “year of friendship” to deepen economic and political ties. It was announced that Kim would visit Russian President Vladimir Putin to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. But the trip was later cancelled due to “internal Korean affairs”.Three years earlier, Moscow agreed to write off $10 billion of North Korea’s Soviet-era debt.NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR TESTS EXPLAINED    Meet Putin's DEADLY National Guards Mon, March 13, 2017Putin has ordered a snap inspection of his National Guard to make sure the troops are ready for action Play slideshow  1 of 13

    BulgariaNorth Korea made an alliance with Bulgaria when it was under communist rule in 1948, a signed a bilateral cooperation agreement in 1970.Bulgaria is now Kim’s only ally in Europe, however in March Sofia pledged that it will take “all necessary measures” to implement UN sanctions against North Korea.Restrictions were introduced on coal, iron and iron ore originating from North Korea, and the number of staff at North Korea’s embassy in Bulgaria was reduced.BeninBenin is another former communist state with ties to North Korea. In 2013, North Korean state media quoted ex-President of Benin, Thomas Boni Yayim, describing relations between North Korea and Benin as “excellent ones of friendship and tradition”.  GETTYKim Jong-un's only ally in Europe is BulgariaDemocratic Republic of CongoNorth Korea has forged ties with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which is notoriously unstable.Last year a confidential report to the UN Security Council accused Pyongyang of supplying Congolese troops and police with weapons and training, breaking a UN arms embargo.MadagascarMadagascar has an unlikely historic alliance with North Korea. During the 1970s, North Korea helped build the fledgling state’s presidential Iavoloha Palace and new waterways free of charge.
