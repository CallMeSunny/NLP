   Meng, 46 - daughter of the Chinese electronics telecoms giant’s founder Ren Zhengfei - was arrested between flights at Vancouver airport on December 1. She faces extradition to the United States where sources claim she is wanted for questioning over possible sanctions violations, and is due to appear in court for a bail hearing later today. According to a report from Reuters, the US has been investigating Huawei for using the global banking system in an effort to evade wide-ranging sanctions targeting Iran.

They will retaliate and take hostages."If I was an American tech executive, I wouldn't travel to China this week.”  China news: Xi Jinping and Donald Trump have been engaged in a bitter trade war (Image: GETTY)Marty Kay, the editor of Politico Pro, wrote on Twitter: "The arrest of the Huawei executive is a BIG deal in China and is probably being underplayed in the US news cycle. Equivalent of an Apple or Facebook exec being arrested in China."Relations between the feuding countries appeared to have thawed after US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed not to impose any new tariffs on goods for 90 days following a meeting at last weekend's G20 summit in Buenos Aires.It saw Mr Trump agree to delay increasing tariffs on a further $200 billion of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent, pending further talks.But experts have now warned this apparent truce could now be completely shattered as a result of Meng’s arrest, with some predicting the US will use the situation as a bargaining tool in the ongoing trade war.Liu Weidong, a China-US affairs expert from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the South China Morning Post: “We’ll see more cases like this over the next three months, sanctioning China’s state-owned enterprises and individuals, to boost momentum on the US side.” Related articles   US-China trade WAR: 'I'm a TARIFF MAN!'
