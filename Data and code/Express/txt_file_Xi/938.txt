    According to Mundo Deportivo, Hebei China Fortune are determined to secure Messi’s services and are prepared to pay his £621m (€700m) buyout clause to do so.The Chinese Super League side are aware that the Rosario-born ace will not just determine where his future lies based on the money on offer though.And that’s apparently why they’ve already signed his Argentina team-mates Lavezzi and Mascherano over the past couple of years.Those deals were struck, with Mascherano moving from Barcelona last month, in order to convince Messi that Hebei is the place for him to continue his career.  GETTYHebei China Fortune want to lure Barcelona star Lionel Messi to the Far East     GETTYLionel Messi is close friends with Hebei China Fortune stars Ezequiel Lavezzi and Javier MascheranoMundo Deportivo indicate the financial side of the deal could be supported by huge companies linked to Hebei China Fortune, as well as the country’s government.Messi’s global stardom means his arrival would not just be a sporting boost but would also align with president Xi Jinping’s desire to substantially increase football participation in the country.Chinese conglomerate Tencent Holdings Limited have got wind of Hebei China Fortune’s fresh plan for Messi, despite his refusal to join them last year.And it now seems it will only be a matter of time before an eye-watering £621m bid is launched to reunite Messi with Lavezzi and Mascherano.
