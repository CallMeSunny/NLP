  GETTYChina has built new military facilities on disputed islands in the South China SeaDuring a visit to Washington, Chinese President Xi Jinping told Barack Obama in 2015 that China would not militarise the man-made islands.Yet in the intervening 20 months, Beijing has stepped up construction and now has runways that can accommodate Chinese fighter jets.Over the past three months, China has reportedly built four new missile shelters on Fiery Cross, increasing the number of installations on the reef to 12.China has also expanded radar facilities on Fiery Cross and two other disputed reefs — Subi and Mischief — in the Spratly Island chain.

Now every time they put in a new radar or new missile shelter, it is harder for the world to get angry. They are building a gun, they are just not putting the bullets in yet.”  GETTYXi Jinping told Barack Obama in 2015 that China would not militarise the man-made islands Discover the disputed islands of the South China Sea Wed, May 10, 2017Among the islands at the heart of territorial disputes in the South China Sea.

     When asked about freedom of navigation and new construction in the South China Sea, a People’s Liberation Army spokesperson said there was “no problem with China’s freedom to carry out construction on its own territory”.China’s legal claim to the seas around the maritime features is legally controversial because many were dredged out of coral and sand and therefore not entitled to island status.Euan Graham, an Asia expert at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, said it was “not quite game over in the South China Sea”.However, he added that China had fundamentally changed the status quo over the islands and that it would prove hard to change barring war or natural disasters.  GETTYThere was a two-day summit between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump in April   Mr Graham said: “They already exert a strategic effect by projecting China’s presence much further out.“They will not prevent the US Navy from operating in their vicinity, but they will complicate the threat environment for US ships and aircraft — by extending the [Chinese navy’s] surveillance and targeting net, as well as the envelope of power projection.”Ely Ratner, an Asia expert who served in the Obama administration, admitted the US had failed to come up with an effective strategy to convince China to halt militarisation of the islands.Mr Ratner said: “Until China believes that there will be significant costs... I don’t think they have any reason to slow down. They have been pushing on an open door and have been surprised at how little resistance they have faced.”
