   The OECD calculated as much as 0.8 percent could be slashed off global gross domestic product by 2021 as the Paris-based international organisation forecast a slowdown in global growth. Predicting global growth would fall from 3.7 percent this year to 3.5 percent in 2019 and 2020, the OECD warned of the effects of escalating trade tensions and higher interest rates. OECD chief economist Laurence Boone said: “We’re returning to the long-term trend. We’re not expecting a hard landing, however, there’s a lot of risks.

Washington is demanding Beijing improve market access and intellectual property protections for US companies, cut industrial subsidies and slash a $ 375 billion trade gap.President Trump has imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports to force concessions.The US tariff rate on $200 billion in Chinese goods is set to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent on January 1.President Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports - about $267 billion more in goods - if Beijing fails to address US demands.
