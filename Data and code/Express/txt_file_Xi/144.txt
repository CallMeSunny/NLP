   The last-minute meeting came after Canadian leaders sat down with Chinese President Xi Jinping for a private dinner in Beijing.Prime Ministers Justin Trudeau’s Office confirmed that Mr Champagne had stayed behind to try to nail down a framework to launch trade talks, stating that the Canadian side did not want to squander the momentum they had built over two days of discussions in the capital.Mr Trudeau had earlier expressed optimism that free trade talks between the two countries would get under way.Canada’s ambassador to China, John McCallum, told reporters that despite an apparent setback when an expected announcement failed to emerge on Monday, the formal beginning of trade talks during Mr Trudeau’s visit was still “conceivable.”  EPACanadian PM Justin Trudeau and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang  Related articles   Trump's NAFTA demands REJECTED: Talks stall as Mexico and Canada    Justin Trudeau’s tears make him a ‘man of strength’ expert claims   EPAJustin Trudeau reviews the Chinese paramilitary guard friendship between Canada and China will play an important role in setting the tone and the approach that will characterise the 21st centuryJustin TrudeauThe PM’s office released a brief summary of Mr Trudeau’s meeting with Mr Xi as the prime minister prepared to deliver a keynote address on attracting investment to Canada to the Fortune Global Forum, a massive business conference in Guangzhou that is expected to include wealthy executives like Apple CEO Tim Cook.During their meeting, Mr Trudeau and Mr Xi discussed the “ongoing exploratory discussions on potential trade negotiations,” as well as climate change, North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests and the plight of Rohingya people in Burma.The release made no mention of human rights or Canadians imprisoned in China, which Mr Trudeau had said he would raise with Mr Xi as he had done with Premier Li Keqiang earlier in the week.
