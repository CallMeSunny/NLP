  GETTYTrump plans to meet Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is embroiled in a corruption scandalThe US Justice Department has been conducting a criminal probe of 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a fund founded by Prime Minister Najib, which is facing money-laundering probes in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore. In civil lawsuits, the Justice Department has sought to seize a total of about $1.7 billion in assets it says were bought with misappropriated 1MDB funds. Malaysia's foreign ministry said in a statement that Prime Minister Najib will undertake the visit following an invitation from President Trump.   GETTYMr Razak's 1MDB fund is facing money-laundering probes in at least six countries The two leaders are expected to discuss areas of mutually beneficial cooperationMalaysia's foreign ministry“The two leaders are expected to discuss areas of mutually beneficial cooperation, including national security, the global fight against terrorism and extremism, and trade and investment that will benefit our nations and our peoples,” the foreign ministry said in the statement. The United States sees Prime Minister Najib as a key partner in its fight against radical Islamists. But that image has been damaged recently after Prime Minister Najib was linked to the 1MDB scandal, and his party overtly supported right-wing groups for political gains ahead of the polls that must be held by mid-2018.   Trump looks forward to “discussing ways to strengthen and broaden our bilateral relationship and expand regional cooperation with one of America's closest partners in Southeast Asia,” said a White House statement announcing Prime Minister Najib's September 12 visit. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the plan for a meeting, said Prime Minister Najib would likely use the White House visit to try to play down the possibility of further investigations into 1MDB. Relations between Malaysia and the United Stated soured last year after the Justice Department filed lawsuits in connection with the 1MDB scandal and Prime Minister Najib sought to strengthen ties with China.   GETTYThe US sees Mr Najib as a key partner in its fight against radical Islamists First 100 days of President Trump Mon, June 12, 2017President Donald Trump is making a significant impact on global politics during his first term.

    US relations with Malaysia, which the United States sees as an important partner in standing up to China's extensive territorial claims in East Asia, had improved under President Barack Obama, who in 2014 became the first U.S. president to visit the country in 50 years. Prime Minister Najib was a key ally in President Obama's strategic pivot to Asia, and was part of the collapsed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) pact. Chinese President Xi Jinping is also expected to visit Malaysia in the coming months, local media reports said, although this has not been officially confirmed.
