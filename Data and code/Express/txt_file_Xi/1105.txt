   President Xi Jinping is reportedly eyeing a base in the Pacific nation where Chinese naval ships would dock to be serviced, refuelled and restocked at a Vanuatu port, with the agreement eventually leading to a full military base.Australia’s Fairfax Media reported there had been informal discussions between China and Vanuatu, but no formal offer.Vanuatu, around 1,200 miles east of northern Australia, was home to a key US Navy base during the Second World War that helped beat back the Japanese army as it advanced through the Pacific towards Australia.A Chinese military base so close to the Australian coast and just 3,000km from New Zealand would allow China to project military power in the Pacific Ocean, potentially increasing the risk of confrontation between the US and Chinese forces.

    However, Vanuatu's Foreign Minister Ralph Regenvanu denied the reports this morning.He told the Australian Broadcasting Corp: “No one in the Vanuatu Government has ever talked about a Chinese military base in Vanuatu of any sort.“We are a non-aligned country. We are not interested in militarisation, we are just not interested in any sort of military base in our country."A Chinese embassy spokesman said the idea was “ridiculous".Chen Ke, a spokesman for the ambassador to Vanuatu, added: “ That’s impossible. That conversation was never on the table.”
