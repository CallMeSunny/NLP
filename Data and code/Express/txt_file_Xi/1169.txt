     t signals to Pyongyang that the US has a new sheriff in town who isn't hesitant about pulling his gun from the holsterKim Yong-Hyun, a professor at Dongguk UniversityAnd experts have claimed the attack now adds more weight to Trump's recent threat of unilateral action against North Korea if Beijing fails to encourage its neighbour to halt its nuclear weapons program.But it seems the message Donald Trump may be trying to convey may not be the one being heard in Pyongyang.Joel Wit, a senior fellow at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, said, "Trump's attack on Syria is unlikely to have any significant effect on a North Korea that is already well versed in the threat posed by the United States."
