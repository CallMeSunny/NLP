     Washington’s strategy is designed to contain and influence China if possibleJames Petras, International expert and authorThe Trump administration's decision to launch this operation comes as the Republican leader attempts to seek China's cooperation in reigning in North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes.However, an international expert claimed the US President is only using his feud with North Korea to launch a surprise attack on China.  GETTYDonald Trump has provoked Xi Jing by launching aggression against attackersqJames Petras said: "Washington’s strategy is designed to contain and influence China if possible, and in extreme basis for launching a nuclear attack on China.“I think the pretext of attacking North Korea is simply an excuse to build up US military capabilities for a nuclear attack.”President Trump was previously full of praise for his Chinese counterpart, branding Mr Xi a "gentleman" who wants to "do the right thing".

Many of those countries are friends and allies. It’s not about one country. It’s not about one body of water.“We will continue to do them. But we don’t intend certainly to tell you about them in advance, and we do tell you about them after."
