  GETTYKim Jong-un moves to cement ties with Vladimir Putin ahead of ChinaSome academics who study North Korea argue Kim could be looking for Russia to ease any pain if China, which accounts for about 90 percent of North Korea's trade, steps up sanctions against the isolated country as part of moves to deter its nuclear and missile programmes. President Donald Trump lavished praise on Chinese President Xi Jinping last week for Beijing's assistance in trying to rein in Pyongyang. A day later, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson pressed the United Nations Security Council to impose more sanctions to further isolate Pyongyang. There is no sign of any sustainable increase in trade between Russia and North Korea, but business and transport links between the two are getting busier.   GETTYMr Trump lavished praise on Chinese President Xi JinPing for efforts on Pyongyang Related articles   ‘It’s very disturbing’ Senator blasts Trump’s praise of Kim Jong-un   North Korea detains American academic for 'hostile acts'  North Korea does not care about China's pressure or sanctions because there is Russia next doorLeonid PetrovA new ferry service starting next week will move up to 200 passengers and 1,000 tons of cargo six times a month between North Korea and the Russian port of Vladivostok. Shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon shows there has been a recent steady flow of oil tanker traffic from Vladivostok into North Korean east coast ports. Last Thursday, five North Korean-flagged oil tankers had loaded up at Vladivostok-area ports and identified North Korean ports as their destination.

    Earlier this year, Russian government officials visited Pyongyang to discuss more cooperation in rail transport, according to media reports. A Russian-built railway link between the Russian eastern border town of Khasan and the North Korean port of Rajin has been used to carry some coal, metals and various oil products. “North Korea does not care about China's pressure or sanctions because there is Russia next door,” said Leonid Petrov, a North Korea expert at Australia National University. “Pyongyang has been playing off Beijing and Moscow for half a century, letting them compete for the right to aid and influence North Korea.”   GETTYMr Trump and Mr Putin discussed North Korea on Tuesday but failed to reach an agreement US Army soldiers prepare for WAR against North Korea Fri, April 14, 2017The US military's largest non-nuclear bomb killed dozens of Islamic State militants as it smashed their mountain hideouts, Afghan officials said April 14, ruling out any civilian casualties despite the weapon's destructive capacity.

    Russia, especially Vladivostok, is also home to one of the largest overseas communities of North Koreans in the world, and they send home tens of thousands of dollars in much-needed hard currency each month. Speaking at the United Nations last week, Secretary Tillerson called on states to sever diplomatic and financial ties with Pyongyang and suspend the flow of North Korean guest workers. The Security Council has not yet agreed on any course of action. While Russia has not indicated it will oppose UN sanctions or seek to dilute them, its ties with the United States are fraught, which could complicate its joining any US-led initiative on North Korea. Presidents Trump and Putin spoke in a telephone call on Tuesday and discussed North Korea, among other issues, both sides said. There was no word of any agreement.
