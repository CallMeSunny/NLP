    The German government declined to say what scheduling conflict was preventing her from attending, nor would it say whether the decision might be linked to the truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market that killed 12 people in mid-December.Although the WEF does not comment on which leaders it is expecting until roughly a week before the meeting, the star attraction is expected to be Xi Jinping, the first Chinese president to attend.Members of President-elect's team, including former Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn and fund manager Anthony Scaramucci, are also expected.   AFP GETTYMembers of Donald Trump's team are expected to attend The many faces of Angela Merkel Wed, May 17, 2017German Chancellor, Angela Merkel through the years Play slideshow  1 of 16
