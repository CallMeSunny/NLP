    Geng Shuang, China's foreign ministry spokesman, claims freezing military drills in exchange for a freeze on North Korean missile testing was the best means of achieving peace in the region.He said: “China sees the freeze-for-freeze scheme is the most reasonable way.”The official’s comments follow a 12-day tour of Asia by President Trump, in which the Republican firebrand met with China’s newly emboldened leader Xi Jinping to discuss bringing an end to the North Korean threat.   However, on Wednesday the US President claimed he “would not accept” freeze for freeze plans "like those that have consistently failed in the past”.Mr Geng added: ”The freeze-for-freeze move is just for a breakthrough and the first step."The final objective is to peacefully resolve the North's nuclear problem and realise long-term stability on the Korean Peninsula."
