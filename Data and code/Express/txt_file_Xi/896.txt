He said he would not introduce tit-for-tat restrictions on the entry of Ukrainians into Russia after Kiev imposed a ban on Russian males aged 16 to 60 from entering its territory. After US President Donald Trump cancelled a planned meeting with Putin - with the two opting for a brief sideline discussion instead - at the summit, citing the military tensions with Ukraine, the Russian leader said there were no pre-conditions for future bilateral talks. Mr Putin said: “It is regrettable that we can't succeed in holding a full-scale meeting, which is long due.”   He said issues of strategic stability would be of paramount importance.Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov confirmed Mr Putin ad Mr Trump has a brief meeting on the sidelines of the summit yesterday, despite the US President’s administration accusing Russia of non-compliance with the 31-year-old Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty following the shots fired at the Ukrainian ships.Mr Trump said the US will pull out of the deal as a result of Mr Putin’s actions.
