  GETTYSanctions could disrupt North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, it has been claimedThe US Treasury Department earlier this week announced new sanctions on Chinese and Russian entities that help fund and facilitate North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.Coupled with the United Nations Security Council resolution passed earlier this month, the sanctions are intended to further isolate companies and individuals outside of North Korea that provide key support to Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.Robert Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, has suggested that people are wrong to argue the latest round of sanctions will be ineffective because earlier measures have been comparatively mild.

    He said: ”The irony is that while Trump has rejected Obama's policy of 'strategic patience,' it will take time, perhaps 12 to 15 months, for these efforts to bear fruit."Where Obama was largely waiting out Pyongyang and doing little to squeeze them, Trump's pressure tactics could bite, but require that same strategic patience."But Mr Manning also argued that the latest sanctions would not hit China hard, claiming that no major Chinese banks or companies have been targeted yet.  GETTYBeijing provides a key lifeline for the North Korean economy   He said: "This will have no significant impact on China's overall national economy. It is something that President Xi Jinping can live with.”US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called on China to put more pressure on North Korea.Beijing provides a key lifeline for the North Korean economy as it accounts for roughly 85 per cent of Pyongyang's imports, according to UN data.
