  Getty ImagesGeorge Osborne is reportedly planning to book a trade trip to ChinaGeorge Osborne has revealed his intention to cosy up to economic giants China in the coming months to ensure the two countries remain on good terms when Britain officially breaks from the Union.Deals worth more than £40bn were signed between the nations when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the UK last October where he called relations between the nations a ”golden time".During the visit the president of almost four years made it clear he supported a “united” Europe - which included Britain.But Britons stunned the world on June 23 with a vote to leave the EU and Westminster has been engulfed by the bitter fallout after the resignation of PM David Cameron.The Brexit vote threatens to redefine Britain's growing financial services relationship with China, which has agreed to a number of joint projects as part of the China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue programme to deepen economic ties between the two counties, based largely on the UK's membership of the EU.Mr Osborne is also talking to the Bank of England to ensure that lending does not "seize up" and that the Brexit vote does not produce a repeat of the credit crunch in 2007-2008, according to the paper.On Friday, the Chancellor gave up his centrepiece policy of turning Britain's budget deficit into a surplus by 2020, faced with potential economic stress following the country's shock decision to leave the EU.It was the latest setback for Osborne who was once considered a future British leader but who has not put himself forward to succeed Cameron after the two men failed in their campaign to keep Britain in the EU.
