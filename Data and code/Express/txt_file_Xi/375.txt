    China has sought to enlist Russia’s help to cool tensions over North Korea amid fears among Beijing’s leaders that hostilities between the United States and Pyongyang are imminent.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi made the appeal in a phone conversation with Sergey Lavrov, his Russian counterpart, after telling reporters that conflict could break out “at any moment”.   Kim Jong-un’s state-owned news agency KCNA claimed Trump’s deployment showed “reckless moves for invading” that had now “reached a serious phase”.Tensions regarding North Korea have threatened to boil over in recent weeks after Donald Trump promised to deal with the nation unilaterally should China not help and put pressure on their neighbour and ally.  GETTYTrump sent the strike group to the region after continued North Korean aggressionAs recently as Thursday, China once again attempted to play peacemaker between the US and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, calling on both sides to avoid a military conflict while asking the latter to curb a nuclear program that’s long been outlawed by the United Nations.Analysts believe Trump is not seeking to become embroiled in hostilities with Kim Jong-un’s regime, but to “harden” China's position towards the reclusive state by unnerving Beijing into reining in its wayward neighbour.
