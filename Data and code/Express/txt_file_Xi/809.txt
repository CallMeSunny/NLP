  GETTY/ IGChina has banned a church and accused religious leaders of collaborating with South Korea Authorities have accused the River of Life Berea Church and the Berea’s Research Institute of Theology in the coastal Fujian province of having a connection with South Korea. Tensions have escalated between China and its near neighbour amid a row over South Korea installing the US THAAD anti-missile system in a show of force against Beijing’s ally North Korea. Churchgoers have been accused of illegally setting up religious meeting places and using donated money as “illegal income”.  Related articles   Vicar JAILED for two years after ‘divulging state secrets'   Chinese police attack Christians over surveillance inside churches Xi Jinping’s Chinese Communist Party have launched a major crackdown on religion in recent months in an attempt to oppress religious freedom and exercise control. China Aid says the Huli District Ethnic and Religious Affairs Bureau also confiscated more than £150 from the church which was founded eight years ago. Lawyers are considering launching legal action against the government with one pastor saying the state is treating the church like a cult.     Since the government can’t accuse the church of collaborating with the US, the officers now use Korea as an excusePastor ZhangA pastor, identified only as Zhang, said: “Since the government can’t accuse the church of collaborating with the US, the officers now use Korea as an excuse.“Since religions are founded in different countries, the people are unavoidably ‘collaborating with foreign powers’ when they choose a religious belief. Jesus himself was a foreigner. “This logic is ridiculous. Our government has armed itself to the teeth in order to control people’s minds.”   AFPChurches not sanctioned by the government have been put under surveillance  GETTYXi Jinping’s Chinese Communist Party have launched a major crackdown on religionA lawyer looking into the case said: “They are afraid of fighting against the government. I asked local lawyers to help, but they haven’t responded yet. “The mainland government has intensified the persecution against Christianity. … It is ridiculous to arrest someone for attending house churches. “The government often uses the excuse that Christians are ‘disrupting social order’ to persecute them, since that can be applied to every house church in the country.” The U.S. and South Korea Launch Operation Max Thunder Thu, April 20, 2017The US and South Korea kicked off a big exercise just as North Korea threatens 'thermonuclear war'.

    The move comes as China bans Christians from praying, singing hymns, removed crosses from buildings and arrested people for attending worship. Churches not sanctioned by the government have been put under surveillance with hundreds of Christians arrested for disturbing public order for offences such as holding bible study groups and displaying crucifixes outside their homes.
