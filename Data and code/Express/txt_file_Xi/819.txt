    When asked what those negative consequences could be, he said: "Look at Iraq, look at Libya."The warning comes after President Trump’s passionate speech at the White House, following the gas attack in Syria on Tuesday.Since the suspected chemical attack, the US has since launched more than 50 Tomahawk missiles on the Syrian airfield, where gas assault left at least 80 people dead.The strike was launched at 8:45 pm ET, targeting the airfield's hangers, aircraft, runways, and fuel storage areas – while Trump was dining with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The US strike caused “losses”, according to a Syrian military source, but numbers are yet to be confirmed.  REUTERSTrump did not seek Congress approval for Syria strike, but US politicians have applauded himThe US military believes the strike has “severely damaged or destroyed Syrian aircraft and support infrastructure” – as many as 14 fighter jets have been destroyed.Responding to the attack, President Trump held an impromptu press conference and said: “Tonight I ordered a targeted military strike on the military airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched.“It is in vital national security interests of the United States to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons.”.@POTUS Trump delivers statement on targeted, military strike on airfield in #Syria from where chemical attack was launched. pic.twitter.com/N54VvI88sc— Department of State (@StateDept) April 7, 2017The Pentagon has confirmed Russia was notified of the strike. Spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said: “Russian forces were notified in advance of the strike using the established deconfliction line. US military planners took precautions to minimise risk to Russian or Syrian personnel located at the airfield."However, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said: "There were no discussions or prior contacts, nor had there been any since the attack with Moscow."  AFPPresident Trump's missile strike in SyriaSenators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, both armed services committee hawks who have previously criticised Donald Trump on several occasions, were quick to applaude the US President's offensive.In a joint statement, they said: "We salute the skill and professionalism of the US armed forces who carried out tonight’s strikes in Syria. Acting on the orders of their commander-in-chief, they have sent an important message: the United States will no longer stand idly by as Assad, aided and abetted by Putin’s Russia, slaughters innocent Syrians with chemical weapons and barrel bombs."  GETTYPresident Assad denied involvement in the gas attackMoments before Trump launched air-strikes in Syria, the US military said they were studying military options in Syria and President Trump insisted, “something should happen”.As he travelled to Florida to meet the Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Mr Trump suggested he may be taking a stronger stance against Assad, an ally of Iran and Russia.Mr Trump told reporters on his Air Force One: “I think what Assad did is terrible.”  GETTYPresident Trump appeared calm after he launched the strikes against SyriaThe poison gas attack on Tuesday in the rebel-held northern Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun killed at least 80 people, many of them children.Washington blamed the attack on the Syrian government, putting it at odds with Russia, which has air and ground forces in Syria. The Syrian government has denied it was behind the attack.Russia is Syria's most powerful ally and has provided the military might behind Assad's grip on the country, which plunged into civil war six years ago.
