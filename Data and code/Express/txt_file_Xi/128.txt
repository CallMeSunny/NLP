    “[Kim] is going to have to do what he has to do. But he understands we're not going to be very happy. And I will tell you, a man that I've gotten to like and respect - the president of China, President Xi - I believe has been putting pressure on him also.“But so far, perhaps nothing's happened and perhaps it has. This was a small missile. This was not a big missile. This was not a nuclear test, which he was expected to do three days ago. We'll see what happens.  GETTYKim Jong-un's missile tests are likely to continue unless North Korea is put under more pressure“If he does a nuclear test, I will not be happy. And I can tell you also, I don't believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either.”President Trump has previously suggested that solving the issue of rising tensions with North Korea through diplomatic means may not be an option. He said: "We'd love to solve things diplomatically but it's very difficult.”Ahead of his 100th day in office, the President had kind words to say about his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping and confirmed the two leaders were working together to try to quell the North Korean threat.  GETTYTrump reiterated his priase for Xi Jinping at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday nightTrump said: "I believe he is trying very hard. He certainly doesn't want to see turmoil and death. He doesn't want to see it. He is a good man. He is a very good man and I got to know him very well."With that being said, he loves China and he loves the people of China. I know he would like to be able to do something, perhaps it's possible that he can’t.”
