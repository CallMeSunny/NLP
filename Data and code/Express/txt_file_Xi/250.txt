   The Rongguili Church, in Guangzhou, southern China was stormed by more than 60 police officers and government officials at around 10am local time on Saturday morning.

A Rongguili church member said: "Halfway through the children's Bible class, we heard the footsteps of dozens of police and officials stomping up the stairs.
