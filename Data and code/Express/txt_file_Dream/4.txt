  GETTYObservers believe China may by plotting to seize control of Taiwan by forceBeijing regards Taiwan as a mutinous province that will always be part of China and some hardline officials believe the longer the island remains outside Beijing’s rule, the harder it will be to get back.Experts believe a timetable to seize the island has already been drawn up and say Chinese generals are planning to make their move in 2020.The observers believe America’s beefed up security presence in the region - along with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s pledge to achieve the “great rejuvenation of the nation” - have prompted Beijing to ditch calls for a peaceful solution and look instead at military options.And there are fears such actions could easily spark a global conflict with Taiwan having a powerful ally in Washington which is bound by treaty to go to its aid if the island is under attack despite having no formal diplomatic relations.

Instead, cross-strait relations have deteriorated.“Second, as one generation of Taiwanese replaces another, the ‘Chinese’ identity among the people will only grow weaker.“Third, the influence of Taiwan’s political parties is waning. Even if the Kuomintang wins back power, it would not be in a position to lead cross-strait unification.“Fourth, more and more Chinese people are calling for unification by force.”  GOOGLEChina has always seen the Taiwan as a mutinous provinceA spotlight was shone on the tense relationship between China and Taiwan when Donald Trump enraged Beijing by speaking on the telephone to Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen shortly after his election victory in 2016.The controversial call was the first between the leader of the island and a US president since ties between America and Taiwan were severed in 1979 at Beijing’s request and Washington adopted its “one China” principle which officially considers the independently governed island part of the same single Chinese nation as the mainland.Mr Trump ruffled more feathers when he signed into law the 2018 Defense Authorization Act, which would allow port calls by US Navy ships to Taiwan.The move prompted senior Chinese diplomat Li Kexin to declare: “The day that a US Navy vessel arrives in Kaohsiung is the day that our People’s Liberation Army unifies Taiwan with military force.”   GETTYA Taiwanese warship taking part in naval drillsMr Deng warned increased US involvement in the South China Sea could provide Beijing with the motive it needed for military action.He said: “All is set for Beijing to unify with Taiwan by force, except for one thing – a pretext or a reason to take action. “Emboldened by US support, the Taiwanese government that Ms Tsai leads may well test China’s bottom line by further cementing its ties with America, such as with the proposed exchanges between US and Taiwanese navies.“Finally, whether Beijing decides to mobilise against Taiwan in 2020 will still depend on the decision of its leaders.

    “Xi may be tempted to secure the historic achievement of reunification as part of his legacy. Furthermore, if war breaks out, the peacetime systems and procedures will have to be set aside.“This will allow Xi to stay in power beyond his expected retirement in 2022, to give him more time to work on realising the Chinese dream of rejuvenation.“If Beijing takes up arms against Taiwan in 2020, there will be formidable changes for East Asia and the world. “North Korea may also risk waging war on South Korea, if its nuclear capabilities are not eradicated earlier.”
