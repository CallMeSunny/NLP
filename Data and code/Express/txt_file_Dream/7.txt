   The Asian superstate’s official military newspaper was responsible for launching the scathing attack on the Republican firebrand.It said: “The US armed forces have failed to live up to Trump’s expectations. Scandals like ship collisions, drug abuses, and rapes have repeatedly incurred."Today, safety and stability are expectations of people around the world, and cooperation and win-win are the general trends.“The US cannot 'make itself great again' by simply investing more in its defence spending.”  Mr Li blasted the 'reckless measures' being taken by Donald Trump (Image: Getty) Related articles   Donald Trump in Home Alone 2: Why was Donald Trump in Home Alone 2?   Trump 'IS committed' to NATO claims chief The paper’s criticisms were penned by Li Xiang from the War Studies College at the People's Liberation Army Academy of Military Science and the comments were edited by the official PLA Daily.Comments were referencing the US’s 2019 National Defence Authorisation Act that was recently passed and boosted military expenditure by $20billion.Such a move took military spending to $717billion, a tally that marks a decade-spanning record.Mr Li also blasted the “reckless measures” being taken by Trump in a desperate attempt to make the US “great again” and insisted US officials should change the direction of the superpower.He went on: "The US authorities should realise that the main obstacle to reach its ‘make America great again' goal is not that its military is not strong enough, but the reckless measures it takes to become the only superpower.”The author pointed to an ambush by ISIS back in October that killed four members of the US Special Forces as an example of “pouring money” into defence being ineffective.He continued: “The reality underlying these phenomena is that, it is impractical to back up the great dream of 'making America great again' just by simply pouring more money into the US military."The Chinese paper also took personal aim at the US President and blasted his eagerness to withdraw from international agreements since taking the reigns of leadership.  On June 15 the Republican President announced a 25 percent tariff on Chinese goods (Image: Getty)Since taking office in 2017, Trump has removed the US from the Paris Climate Agreement, the Iran nuclear deal and the Trans-Pacific Partnership amongst others.Mr Li wrote that such decisions “seriously damaged the reputation of the US government and impaired the 'soft power' and 'leadership' of the United States in the West”.He added: “Since the beginning of the Trump administration in early 2017, the US has exited the Paris Climate Agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Iran nuclear deal, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and, most recently, the UN Human Rights Council."  China stated it would hit back at the US with tariffs of equal strength (Image: Getty)The blasting of the US comes during a period of high tensions between Washington and Beijing following Trump’s initiation of a trade war between the two superstates.On June 15 the Republican President announced a 25 percent tariff on $50billion (£37.7billion) worth of goods from Xi Jinping’s nation.China soon responded by announcing it would hit back at the US with tariffs of equal strength.
