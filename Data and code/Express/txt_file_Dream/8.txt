  GettyChina's approach could be the solution to the North Korea crisis, an expert has claimedAs tensions between the rogue state, its neighbours and the US approach boiling point, China’s instincts on North Korea could resolve the crisis, according to one expert.Joshua Pollack, editor of The Nonproliferation Review and a leading expert on nuclear proliferation, says showing “willingness to negotiate” with Kim Jong-un would be the first step to cooling the heated conflict.China’s attitude to North Korea has tended to come closest to this.However he says US pressure on China could make matters worse - as it is forcing president Xi Jinping to move his stance more in line with firebrand Donald Trump.

Chinese officials are reluctant to go that far.“Instead, they keep pressing the Americans to ease some of the military pressure on North Korea by suspending major combined exercises in exchange for a suspension of missile and nuclear tests -- the so-called "freeze for freeze" proposal. The Administration has rejected this idea out of hand.”China’s more conciliatory stance, if it can persuade the US to join it, could be the key to calming Kim Jong-un and minimising the threat he poses to the rest of the world.  GettyPresident Xi has become hawkish on North Korea under Trump's influenceHowever Mr Pollack expressed doubts over “whether China will ever be able to sway US leadership toward its own preferences on North Korea”.President Xi has already become more hawkish on North Korea, souring relations, and decreasing the chance of a reconciliation between the hermit dictatorship and the West.He explained: “China has already moved much closer to American preferences, joining the US in a series of more stringent Security Council resolutions.“One result of that was a crumbling of NK-Chinese relations in 2013, followed by the abandonment of restraint in North Korea's testing program in 2014.

    “The trend has deepened since then, with China accommodating the US and losing traction with North Korea.“But the US under Trump rejects compromise-oriented Chinese diplomatic proposals more firmly than ever.”Nonetheless, if Mr Trump listens to China and is prepared to compromise with Kim Jong-un - who is now unlikely to give up his nuclear missiles - it could ease global tensions and avert the risk of World War 3.
