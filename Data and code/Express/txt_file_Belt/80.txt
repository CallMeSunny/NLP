    “The DPRK is ready to counter the war of aggression with a war of justice and cope with the enemy's dagger with a sword and his rifle with an artillery piece.“It is the invariable stand of the Korean army and people and their permanent mode of counteraction.”KCNA also lashed out at reports that the Trump administration is considering deploying smaller tactical nuclear weapons to the region.It added: “This sheds light on the sinister scenario to provoke a nuclear war by all means so as to totally destroy the DPRK and exterminate the population of the north.“Now, the Korean Peninsula is on the threshold of a nuclear disaster and no one knows at what time a thermonuclear war will break out.”
