   Former Portuguese minister and political scientist Bruno Macaes claimed Europe is being replaced by a new “Eurasian century”, as countries within Asia are advancing and quickly developing infrastructure and trade. Mr Macaes said this shift could be an opportunity for Brexit Britain to cement its place into a new relationship with countries across Europe and Asia. Speaking on Channel 4 News, the expert explained the system Britain should follow in reaching out to the world after Brexit, with exiting the single market a crucial element. He said: “I think there are two ways to think about Brexit. It’s either a return to a strong British or even English identity, and I wouldn’t recumbent that.   C4NEWS•GETTYBrexit news: Bruno Macaes how Brexit Britain could find its new place after its left the EU“Or it’s a very difficult but doable project of going out into the world and actually becoming a bridge or a hinge between Asia and Europe. “We saw about the belt and road, that is a project to connect Europe and Asia. Perhaps the UK could take up this project in a different way to the belt and road but also to connect Europe and Asia.” The host, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, asked whether this was for Britain to become the “Singapore of the West”. Mr Macaes added: “I like the idea of Singapore in reverse, but it’s not about lower regulation and lower taxes. People in Singapore will, by the way, tell you that is not the case there.    It’s a very difficult but doable project of going out into the worldBruno Macaes“It is about what Singapore did when they became independent in 1965 they had to look for connections to Europe and the United States. “I think the UK out of the European Union will have to look for connections with Indonesia, to Japan, to China and to India. “The project is similar to the Singapore project, and the Singapore project was a huge success.” The former Portuguese minister added that he thought it was crucial Britain leave the single market when it exits the EU to ensure it gains “freedom”. A movement within the Labour Party and leading Remainers have called for a soft-Brexit approach and for Britain to stay in the single market after the UK has cut ties with Brussels. Mr Macaes said: “I don’t think the UK should stay in the single market precisely because I think the UK needs certain degrees of freedom to start for example positioning itself in some areas between Europe and Asia.  Brexit deal agreement in full: Read the report published Fri, December 8, 2017Read the full 7,000-word agreement on the Brexit deal Play slideshow  EPA1 of 17Here is the 15 page Brexit deal in full

    “Or in some areas innovating in regulation and rules. I think it is important for the UK to have those areas of freedom, and you will get it if the UK leaves the single market. “But they have to be well used, and there are still some doubts about how the process is going to be managed, I’m not going to hide that.”The political scientist reiterated that Britain and Europe still needed to use its power and influence to ensure that human rights and regulations are upheld.Theresa May has insisted the UK will be leaving the single market and customs union when it leaves the EU but will seek a “bespoke” agreement with the EU.
