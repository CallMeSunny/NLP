   India could now be back in strategic influence in the Maldives, where Mohamed Solih has taken power over incumbent Abdulla Yameen with 134,616 votes to 96,132.The Maldives are known for their key shipping lanes, where China and India have repeatedly clashed over using the area for maritime strategy.Influence in the Maldives is dipping towards China at the moment, following interests from the last president Yameen.But as Mr Solih takes office, the question on many people’s lips will be whether China retains its influence in the region.
