   Emmanuel Macron hopes to use this week's visit to China to boost Beijing's ties with Paris, and take over from the UK as China's closest ally in Europe.Mr Macron's first official visit to China is aimed at boosting the global influence of both countries - as France looks to move out of Germany's shadow, and China from the US.The UK had long been seen as China's closest partner in Europe - but since Brexit and the election of Mr Macron, China has increasingly looked to France.Crucially, Mr Macron will visit Beijing two weeks earlier than Theresa May, who is expected to visit at the end of January.
