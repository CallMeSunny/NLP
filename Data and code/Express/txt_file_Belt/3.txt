  GETTYChina's belt and road programme is risky, fear expertsThe ambitious programme aims to bring Silk Road trade routes – an ancient network of trade paths – back to life. State-backed banks in the world's second largest economy are raising billions of pounds worth of investment to push the initiative through. But it comes at a time when worries over China's debt levels are already gathering pace. The Asian country's debts now sits at an eye-watering around 240 per cent of its economy GDP - and predicted to rise to 300 per cent by 2022. The IMF recently issued calls for China to tackle its credit binge and he Bank of England has warned the country's debts are a key risk to stability.

And if projects fail and loans default, the fallout threatens to take down the world economy, experts fear. Bjorn Conrad, vice president at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, told CNBC: "A risk to China's banking system is, by default, a risk to the global banking system."According to CNBC, Xu Chenggang, professor of economics at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business, added: "The impact could be damaging not just for China, but for the global financial system.""These loans are being extended to governments in risky countries to fund risky infrastructure projects. "If the projects were launched by private firms we wouldn't have to worry because they would know they had to bear the consequences. "But here we are talking about government-to-government lending and, ultimately, intergovernmental relations."Beijing already props up large number of companies resulting large numbers of so-called zombie firms that don't fail - but would have under normal market conditions.

    Professor Xu said these firms, many of which are operating below capacity in the crowded mining sector, are part of the reason China is so keen to launch the 'Belt and Road' initiative. He said: "Instead of solving the overcapacity problems, they are expanding the problem to projects overseas."They (China) are proposing lending money to foreign governments, who will then use the Chinese funds to pay the Chinese companies."In another twist, countries that are taking part in the belt and road initiative are developing and pose their own set of political and economic risks. Mr Conrad said: "There is no doubt in my mind that there will be a large number of projects that will have unforeseen problems."There are considerable risks of nonperforming credit in many of these projects and high risks of default."
