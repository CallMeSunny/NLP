  GETTYDonald Trump & Xi Jinping have enjoyed close ties in 2017 – but 2018 may destroy their relationship Although the pair have appeared friendly and united during Mr Trump’s first year in the Oval Office, the leaders of the world’s two major economic powers are thought to be preparing for a far more cut-throat relationship in 2018.Both have ambitious domestic plans, with President Xi hoping to eliminate poverty in China as he tries to make his country the focal point of international trade, travel, production and commerce.2018 also marks the second year of Xi’s ‘One Belt, One Road’ plan, a decade-long project to build highways, bridges, airports, power plants, ports, factories in 68 participating countries across Eurasia. As an incentive for participating countries, Beijing has pledged to spend £111billion ($150billion) a year for 10 years to modernise the infrastructures of participating nations – as long as all those routes and the products they carry go through China.

President Trump is of the opinion that Beijing can single-handedly disarm the increasingly erratic North Korea, on behalf of Washington – something most of the rest of the world recognises is impossible.   Trump has swerved between praising China’s involvement in the North Korean crisis and condemning Beijing for not doing enough during his first year in office, but the President’s early 2018 tweets suggest a considerably more volatile foreign policy.He told the New York Times shortly after Christmas: “If they [China] don’t help us with North Korea, then I do what I’ve always said I want to do.”Mr Trump’s first tweet of the new year was an attack on Pakistan, accusing the country of lying and deceiving the United States and threatening to withdraw billions of dollars of aid.While India and Afghanistan praised the President’s condemnation of Pakistan, China rushed to defend the “great sacrifices” the country has made to combat terrorism.

Mr Trump had been expected to raise his concerns when he visited Asia at the end of last year but the lavish banquet laid on by President Xi appeared to cause Trump to drop the issue.However, the US President has repeatedly vowed to rectify what he sees as huge trade discrepancies between the US and China, and should Xi put nursing his own ego ahead of flattering Mr Trump, 2018 could prove rocky for Sino-US relations.
