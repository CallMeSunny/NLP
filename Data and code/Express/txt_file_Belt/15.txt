  GETTYVladimir Putin appears to be less than impressed with China-Russia trade relationsDespite Xi Jinping describing the China-Russia relationship as “the ballast stone” of world continuity, a landmark infrastructure agreement between the two powerhouses is crumbling.Both Vladimir Putin and Mr Xi agreed in 2015 to integrate their two economic schemes, China’s Belt and Road programme and Russia’s Eurasian Economic Union, but mutual distrust has taken hold.Chinese trade travel into Europe accounted for around 70 per cent of Russia’s cargo in 2016, as the goods cross European Russia in order to get to the Brussels bloc from Kazakhstan.

GETTYThe pair are unlikely to be toasting a landmark infrastructure deal any time soonThere are now fears in the Kremlin that China’s Belt and Road scheme is muscling in on traditional Russian territory and that the multi-billion pound Chinese plan could de-rail Mr Putin’s own plans.Vladimir Portyakov, deputy director of the Institute of Far Eastern Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences: “The most unpleasant issue for us is that China is becoming a serious centre for integration processes in Eurasia, which it never was in the past.“Instead of linking up the Eurasian Economic Union and the Belt and Road, we may end up with the EEU being subordinated to this Chinese scheme.” Vladimir Putin swaps presidency for ice hockey with disastrous results Wed, May 10, 2017Russian president Vladimir Putin played some hockey in Sochi today and put on quite a display Play slideshow  AFP/Getty Images1 of 10Russian President Vladimir Putin falls down during the 'Night League' teams ice hockey Gala match

    To make matters worse, Russia is yet to see any serious benefit from China’s plans.Yuri Tavrovsky, a China expert close to the nationalist Eurasian School of Russian Academics, said: “Russia hasn’t found a satisfying place, a reflection of its interests in this initiative, and China has not been able to propose an attractive role for Russia in it.”One unnamed Russian official waded into the debate, telling the Financial Times: “Our Chinese colleagues speak of ‘win-win’ all the time, but they have to make some compromises if they want us to get anywhere.” Related videos   China test missile guided destroyer in waters near North Korea   City appears to be FLOATING in the sky in China    China holds live-fire drill near North Korean border President Xi, however, is seeking to reassure Russian officials.He said: “The aim of the Belt and Road is not to reinvent the wheel. Rather it aims to complement the development strategies of countries involved.”
