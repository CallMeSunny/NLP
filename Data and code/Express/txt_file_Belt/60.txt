   The revelation was made on France 24 by TIME magazine political correspondent Vivienne Walt. She claimed that the absence of the UK from key talks with China’s Xi Jinping is “weighing on the minds” of French president Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Ms Walt said: “Just to pick up on our Brexit conversation - yes, you have Juncker, Merkel, Macron.

"We, as Europeans, want to play an active part (in the Belt and Road project)," Merkel said after the talks. "That must lead to certain reciprocity, and we are still wrangling over that a bit."Juncker, who will host an EU-China summit in Brussels next month, reinforced EU calls for better trade reciprocity so that "European businesses could have the same degree of access to the Chinese market as Chinese businesses have in Europe."The Belt and Road Initiative, championed by Xi, aims to link China by sea and land with Southeast and Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa, through an infrastructure network along the lines of the old Silk Road.France says any Silk Road-style cooperation must work in both directions. Even as he presided over the signing of trade deals with China worth tens of billions of dollars this week, including an Airbus deal to sell 300 aircraft to China's state buying agency, Macron pushed back against Beijing's rights record and ambitions.
