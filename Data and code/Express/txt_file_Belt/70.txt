  Experts from a think tank have warned at the possibility of an international crisis (Image: GETTY)It includes escalating tension between the US and China over the South China Sea and the “blurring of lines” with its engagement with Russia. This year is going to be year of uncertainty, warns the Centre for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS). Samuel Brannen, head of the CSIS Risk and Foresight Group, has said that the US and China have dragged other countries into their strategic and economic affairs in the Indo-Pacific region.

Rear Admiral Lou Yuan said that “what the United States fears the most is taking casualties” before declaring that destroying one of its supercarriers would kill 5,000 navy personnel.He added that Beijing holds three “bargaining chips” over the US including what he described as America’s “second-rate” automotive industry and US soybean exports.Mr Brannen has further warned that this risk of escalation is high between competing countries.He said: “Russia, China, Iran and North Korea will continue to engage in a range of covert activities that blur the lines of war and peace, negating traditional strengths of the United States and its allies.
