The increase would boost its overall numbers to more than 150,000, which would be aseven year high.

MEP Verhofstadt has thrown his support behind Nigel Farage (Image: GETTY)The comments come after Germany's foreign minister has questioned whether or not the UK really wants to leave the European Union - a week after extending the Brexit deadline to October 31.Heiko Maas said asking for another extension would show the UK secretly wants to stay in the EU. His harsh criticism comes he said the UK will also not be granted another extension past October. He said: “Another extension could send the signal that they plan to stay in the EU after all.”Last week, the EU gave Theresa May an extension to get Brexit over the line by October 31 with her MPs after failing to meet the original March 29 deadline.This has left MPs furious as it means the UK will now have to stand in the upcoming European Parliament elections next month. European Council president Donald Tusk only accepted the extension with the promise the UK would “continue it sincere cooperation” as a member state - including taking part in the elections in May.Mr Maas told the Financial Times it would be absurd if the Mrs May failed to get her Withdrawal Agreement through the Commons before next month.He said: “Just think about it: You say you want to leave Europe and then you hold a European Parliament election.”Meanwhile in the UK, Parliament is in recess for the Easter holiday.Talks between the Government and Labour are said to be continuing to find a Brexit agreement that will be acceptable to MPs.The EU has insisted the terms of the UK's withdrawal, which has already been rejected three times by MPs, cannot be renegotiated.However, there is potential to strengthen the political declaration, a document setting out the parameters of the UK's future relations with the EU, ahead of the new Brexit deadline.FOLLOW EXPRESS.CO.UK FOR LIVE UPDATES Related articles   Tusk calls on 'DREAMERS' to work together to CANCEL Brexit   Verhofstadt claims Brexit delay risks 'KILLING' European Union 10.12pm update: "Tusk vows never to stop dreaming" about united EuropeEuropean Council President Donald Tusk has said he will never give up on the "dream" of a united Europe.Mr Tusk tweeted: "At the summit one Prime Minister warned us not to be dreamers, not to think #Brexit could be reversed."But in this difficult moment, we need dreamers and dreams.

Don't even think about that."3.58pm update: "Risk to Scottish economy remains high"Professor Graeme Roy, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute, said: "Last week's announcement to move the deadline for the UK's departure from the EU to October has helped to reduce the imminent threat of a no-deal outcome impacting upon the Scottish economy."However, it has only kicked the can down the road with little evidence so far of UK policymakers being able to agree a compromise approach."The risks to the economy therefore remain high."Moreover the nature of the UK's withdrawal from the EU is but one step in the process - the negotiations on the terms of the UK's future relationship with the EU have yet to begin in earnest."But Brexit should not be the only focus of attention. One consequence of the Brexit debate is that it has left little room for discussion of the emerging structural challenges and opportunities our economy is facing."3.55pm update No-deal Brexit would cause "contraction" of Scottish economy, suggests studyEconomists have predicted the impact of a no-deal Brexit could cause a "significant contraction" in the Scottish economy.The Fraser of Allander Institute modelled several possible Brexit outcomes and the impact in its latest economic commentary.The research institute's worst-case scenario was a no-deal Brexit with no policy response, which it predicted would cause an overall economic downturn of -2.1% in 2019.This predicts a "significant contraction" in the Scottish economy in the second half of 2019 of around 5.5%.In this scenario, the economy could shrink by 1.5% in 2020 before returning to positive growth of 1.4% by the following year.However, the institute warns that this model assumes no policy response from the Government or Bank of England, which it said is "not very realistic".

There is clearly an agenda for change.“I will be fighting for a People’s Vote and I think Remain should be one of the choices of the two."    var brightcoveBrandsafety='4 Sport and specialist news &ndash; passed for ad targeting' 2.30pm update: Tories fear losing half of MEPs in European Parliament electionsCandidates said the combination of Brexit chaos the PM barely holding on to power means the elections will be an uphill.One Tory candidate told the Financial Times: “It’s not the Brexit deal that is the problem — it’s her,”"If the prime minister is still in place, we’ll go below 10 percent [of the vote] and might end up with just four MEPs."

It's also positive that real pay continues to rise faster than it has on average over the last two years."Although securing a  extension means we have averted an economic crisis, politicians must now come together and avoid a no-deal scenario or risk impacting the UK's stellar labour market."    var brightcoveBrandsafety='4 Sport and specialist news &ndash; passed for ad targeting' 11.18am update: Mr Corbyn weighs on Mr Farage's comments from the European ParliamentMr Corbyn said he former Ukip leader is not the answer because the UK needs to have a relationship with the EU regardless of how the country leaves.He said: "We have a major trading partnership with Europe and all Farage is offering is some kind of never-never-land, saying we'll walk away from everything."Well, he should say that to those people whose jobs would be at risk in manufacturing industries and food processing industries."He should say that to those people who are really going to suffer as a result of this."We're serious about having a trading relationship with Europe. We're serious about our relationship with the rest of the world. I'm not sure he is."Asked whether the Brexit Party was a risk to Labour and Conservative in the European elections, he said: "We will fight the elections as a party that is committed to that relationship with Europe but above all it's about uniting people however they voted in 2016, they're suffering from austerity."11.10am update: Jeremy Corbyn insists the UK musts remain in EU customs unionWhen asked if there had been progress on Brexit in talks between the Government and the Labour Party, Mr Corbyn reinforced that the future relationship with Europe had to be one where there was a customs union.He said: "There has to be access to European markets and above all there has to be a dynamic relationship to protect the conditions and rights that we've got for environment and consumer workplace rights."We've put those cases very robustly to the Government and there's no agreement as yet, we've put the case, we've had quite interesting, quite long technical discussions particularly on environment regulations."He added: "The Government doesn't appear to be shifting the red lines because they've got a big pressure in the Tory party that actually wants to turn this country into a deregulated low-tax society which will do a deal with Trump."I don't want to do that."Mr Corbyn said the talks were continuing.He added: "We've lost a lot of time by the dithering of the Government on bringing issues to Parliament."11.02am update: Polling expert suggests Farage's Brexit Party will not succeed in European Parliament electionSir John Curtice suggested the Brexit Party and Ukip combined may fail to secure a substantial majority at the European elections despite the growing dissent toward Theresa May for her decision to further extend Brexit.Sir John Curtice said recent polls suggest Conservative voters are considering throwing their support behind the newly-founded Brexit Party and Ukip in response to the latest delay to Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.
