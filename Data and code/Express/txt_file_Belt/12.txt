    Since Britain voted for Brexit last June the Government has been keen to show the UK is a global nation which is bigger than the union it is leaving.As negotiations with the EU continue, Mr Hammond and foreign secretary Boris Johnson have been spreading their net wide in a bid to secure free trade deals for Britain outside of the EU.   Yesterday, Mr Hammond was seen laughing with Japanese finance minister Taro Aso at the G7 Summit of finance ministers in Bari, Italy.He added: “China and the UK have a long and rich trading history indeed the English first attempted to establish a trade route to China in the 16th Century, although it took us four decades to find one!“I welcome the Belt and Road initiative as an opportunity to strengthen these ties and I am excited to see the progress that has already been made.”  GettyRussian President Vladimir Putin met Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan  GettyMr Hammond has been trying to gain free trade deals with countries such as JapanBritain became fully involved in the initiative, which has 900 ongoing projects and investment of nearly US$1trillion, in January when a freight train carried goods from Yiwu on the East China Sea on a 7,500 mile journey to East London, passing through seven countries on a 15-day voyage.Last week it returned to China through Europe and central Asia with four containers of British goods.Mr Hammond finished off his speech by saying: “As China drives forward the Belt and Road initiative from the East we in Britain are a natural partner in the West, standing ready to work with all partner countries to make a success of this initiative and delivering the jobs, growth and higher living standards that must be our central ambition for all of our citizens.”
