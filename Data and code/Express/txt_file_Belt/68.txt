GettyGeneral Bipin Rawat expressed his deep concern for a war on two fronts with China and Pakistan“In sum, China and Pakistan are one entity threatening India on multiple fronts.”The former lieutenant discussed China’s “adept” skill for taking territory without resorting to “direct conflict”.He remarked: “China is adept at nibbling territory, and going by the experience of the Doklam crisis, it never seeks direct conflict.  GettyMr Katoch explained that Pakistan’s 'foreign and defence policies' could be influenced by China“It calls an area 'disputed,' and then occupies it by proclaiming it as Chinese territory.“That is what China is likely to do with India, particularly its northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which is called 'Southern Tibet' by China.“If there is a confrontation by India, which would be natural, Beijing is likely to blame the escalation on New Delhi.”
