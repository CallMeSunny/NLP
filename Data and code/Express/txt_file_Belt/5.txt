  GETTYThe Bank of China is seeking help from London's financial sector for its 'Belt and Road' initiativeSun Yu, general manager of the bank’s London branch, said the capital’s powerhouse financial sector could be a “solution provider” for the $900billion (£666billion) project designed to bolster economic growth across Asia and the wider world.The programme has been branded the modern-day silk road and will include a string of developments across the globe, from a high-speed railway in East Africa and a port in Sri Lanka to bridges in Bangladesh.“China wants to embrace globalisation."The Belt and Road Initiative is a great opportunity, while risk management is critical,” Sun Yu said.
