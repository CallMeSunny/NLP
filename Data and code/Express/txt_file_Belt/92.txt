    Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was strengthened this morning by China’s announcement about the Belt and Road initiative. Chinese President Xi Jinping outlined his ambitious plans to create a “modern Silk Road” through large infrastructure projects that he believes will help herald a new era of globalisation.While still a long way off from becoming reality, AUD investors were upbeat as they predict the plans could open new markets for Australia’s lucrative commodities trade.   Looking ahead, the GBP/AUD exchange rate is likely to strengthen tomorrow with the release of Britain’s latest consumer price index, which economists expect will show that the UK’s inflation rate surged from 2.3 per cent to 2.6 per cent in April.Markets hope that a further acceleration in inflation will force the BoE’s hand into raising interest rate to order to tackle the growing wage gap facing British workers.Meanwhile, the Australian dollar may stumble overnight with the release of the minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) latest policy meeting. GBP/AUD could firm if the minutes suggest that the Bank’s neutral bias is set to continue for the foreseeable future.
