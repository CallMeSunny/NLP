    This results in the country handing over an asset to China. Like Djibouti leasing one of its military bases to Beijing for $20million in 2016. This became the first overseas post for China’s armed forces.The CBI which represents 190,000 UK businesses believe that the UK must tackle its skill shortages problem, develop infrastructure and promote innovation in the coming year. The CBI is attempting to tackle all three of these problems. The organisation will be campaigning this year for better careers advice and people under the age of 16 to be given at least four chances of trying their hand at different fields of work.A focus will also be put on technical skills as the group wishes to help provide better technical education, apprenticeships and reselling adults.They will also be working on commercialising research out of UK universities, in an attempt to improve the UK’s poor productivity.Also the CBI in a bid to promote infrastructure is applying pressure to such projects as the expansion of Heathrow and the HS2 rail link.
