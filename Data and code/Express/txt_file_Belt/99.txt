  IGThe horrifying moment the plane smashed into the bridgeThe ATR 72-600 domestic flight was carrying 58 people on board when it hit a road bridge in the capital of Taipei.Some 15 people have been pulled from the wreckage but 12 still remain missing.The horrifying moment the plane caught the bridge was captured in dramatic dashboard camera footage.The jet can be seen clipping a taxi and the edge of the bridge before smashing into the river below.The driver of the taxi is understood to have survived.There was a small miracle among the tragedy when camera crews captured the moment a tiny child was pulled alive from the debris.The flight, which was en route from Taipei to the island of Kinmen, lost contact at 10.55am local time, just two minutes after it took off, according to Taiwan's tourism board.   The plane's fuselage was shown by local media half submerged in the Keelung River.Wu Jun-hong, a Taipei Fire Department official who is coordinating the rescue, told reporters at the scene: "At the moment, things don't look too optimistic."Those in the front of the plane are likely to have lost their lives."The Ministry of National Defence said it had sent 165 people and eight boats to the rescue scene.Taipei's fire crew is also assisting with rescue efforts.Survivors wearing life jackets were seen wading clear of the debris.Injured people have been pictured being loaded into ambulances.  REXPassenger jet carrying 58 people crashes into river, Taipei, TaiwanRescue teams are continuing to search for survivors among the wreckage.Another child, named as Lin Riyao, is now reportedly fighting for his life in intensive care after suffering from too much water entering his lungs.The two-year-old was travelling with his parents, Lin Mingwei and his school teacher wife Jiang Yuying, according to reports in Hong Kong's Apple Daily.The manager of Taiwanese travel agent Flying Tourism told the Guardian that they had 15 mainland Chinese tourists on the plane.The manager, who gave his name as Mr Hsu, said that he had only confirmed one injured passenger, which was one of the two children on board.One volunteer rescue worker said: "I've never seen anything like this. This is unprecedented."

We are very sorry."TransAsia Airways will do its utmost to help our passengers, the injured, as well as the families of the passengers on board."We will deploy all our resources to help in the rescue efforts as well as in the aftermath of this incident."  IGA tiny child was pulled safely from the wreckage   A TransAsia media officer declined comment on possible reasons for the crash and deferred to a news conference later today.Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration was also unable to discuss possible causes of the crash.Lin Tyh-ming, the head of Taiwan's civil aviation authority, said the aircraft last underwent maintenance on January 26. The pilot had 4,916 hours of flying hours under his belt and the co-pilot had 6,922 hours, he said.This is not the first time that a TransAsia flight has been involved in such an incident in recent months.A jet operated by the airline crashed in the outlying Taiwan-controlled islands of Penghu last July, killing 48.
