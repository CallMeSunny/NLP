The new measures took effect today, after two fruitless days of talks between top US and Chinese negotiators aimed at rescuing a faltering deal to end the 10-month dispute between the world’s two largest economies. China’s Commerce Ministry said it “deeply regrets” the US decision, saying it would take necessary countermeasures.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin talked for 90 minutes on yesterday Thursday and were expected to resume talks today.The Commerce Ministry said that negotiations were continuing, and that it “hopes the United States can meet China halfway, make joint efforts, and resolve the issue through cooperation and consultation”.However, with no action from the Trump administration to reverse the increase as negotiations moved into a second day, US Customs and Border Protection imposed the new 25 percent duty on affected US-bound cargoes leaving China after 12:01 am EDT (0401 GMT) today.Goods in more than 5,700 affected product categories which left Chinese ports and airports before midnight will be subject to the original 10 percent duty rate, a CBP spokeswoman said.

This also leaves an opportunity for the two sides to reach an agreement in the next couple of weeks.”Mr Trump gave US importers less than five days notice about his decision to increase the rate on the $200bn category of goods to 25 percent, which now matches the rate on a prior $50 billion category of Chinese machinery and technology goods.
