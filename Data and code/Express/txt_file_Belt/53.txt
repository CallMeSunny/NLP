   Previously the German Chancellor had pledged German support for China to be granted the status at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) but it now appears any such wish by China has already been rebuffed by the EU.Beijing is pushing for the recognition as the status would make it harder for other countries to take punitive action against what they see as unfair Chinese trade practices.Both the European Union and the United States, as well as others, have blocked the WTO from agreeing such a status, saying China has not met the terms of a reform agenda it promised when it joined the WTO in 2001.  Reuters/AFPGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese Premier Li KeqiangBoth the EU and US have said that they will fight any WTO change vigorously.A China-EU summit earlier this month saw the Chinese block the release of an anticipated joint statement on climate change after EU officials declined to back China’s demands for the market economy status.During a press conference this month between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Angela Merkel, Mr Li reminded the chancellor of Germany’s previous pledge to which the German leader said trade issues were handled by the EU.

    Mrs Merkel said: “We in the EU, which negotiates on behalf of the member states, are seeking a solution which doesn’t discriminate against China but treats all countries that are in compliance with the WTO the same.”The tussle between the two caused concern within the EU.
