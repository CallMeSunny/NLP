    How is the Chinese New Year celebrated?The Spring Festival is a national holiday in China and is instantly recognisable by banks, schools and business closing down for the celebrations. Thousands of people will don traditional red clothing from head to toe as a symbol of a new beggining and to ward off bad fortune for the new year.One tradition in particular involves family members exchanging little red purses continuing small gifts of money to ward off evil spirits.The start of the Lunar New Year is also marked on a nation-wide scale with fireworks, parades and iconic red Chinese lanterns.Impressive displays of firecrackers and large pyrotechnics will light up several cities across the country. Loud bangs are believed to scare away bad spirits.In fact, China proudly boasts its heritage as the birthplace of gunpowder and fireworks. Legend has it a group of people discovered the joy of firecrackers after throwing hollow bamboo sticks full of gunpowder into a fireplace over one thousand years ago.
