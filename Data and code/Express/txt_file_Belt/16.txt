   Debt-stricken Greece has already stepped out of line by welcoming a massive injection of Beijing cash in allowing Chinese shipping group COSCO to acquire the port of Piraeus. Mr Xi is plotting to turn the Athens dock into the “dragon head” of Chinese entry into Europe as Greece spearheads a rejection of years of economic measures forced on ailing European economies by Brussels. Later this week, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is due to deepen the EU’s China crisis by signing a memorandum of understanding with Mr Xi on Beijing’s $1.2 trillion Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) plan which he hopes will be a magic pot of gold to paying off Rome’s staggering debt.

Italy hopes Chinese investment can turn around its ailing economy in the same manner as Piraeus (Image: GETTY)A new Brussels document, titled ‘EU-China: A Strategic Outlook’, said the bloc “should robustly seek more balanced and reciprocal conditions governing the economic relationship” with Beijing, including tighter rules on foreign state-owned assets.Antonio Tajani, president of the European Parliament, added his fears over Italy’s cosying up to China: “We cannot become a new colony of the Chinese empire.”However, in readying its pact with Beijing, Rome has pointed to more than a dozen other EU nations which have signed memorandums with China including Hungary, Poland, Greece and Portugal.But as the EU’s largest economy to warm to Beijing’s cash waving incentives, Italy’s defection represents a new threat to Brussels solidarity.
