    Just before Christmas the International Monetary Fund’s boss Christine Legarde, who played a major role in Project Fear, claimed that Brexit was now damaging the economy.However, within days she was made to look foolish after the economic growth figures she had quoted were shown to be wrong with revised figures putting Britain equal first with Germany in the G7 major economies for economic growth since 2016.Meanwhile, the Spectator Index revealed that worldwide Britain had the fourth highest growth levels since 2012.
