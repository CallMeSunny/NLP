      GETTYNigel Farage on the campaign trail with Donald Trump last yearHe told the news channel: “Quite honestly, if the British Government went to Trump today and said right, let's crack on, I think that certainly by the end of this year if not a considerable time before, a trade deal could be done."But the problem is we are not allowed to because Mr Juncker says we can't do it until we have left the European Union.”Despite Mr Farage’s comments, Mr Elliott said a trade deal with the EU would also be “straightforward”.He said: “In terms of the UK-EU trade deal, that should be quite straight forward because of course we already have zero tariffs, zero quotas and the same regulations.“In terms of trade deals with the rest of the world, I think that if we don’t complicate it, if we don’t add in lots of regulation and lots of other sundry things like the EU tends to do, it should be quite straightforward.”
