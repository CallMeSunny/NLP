   Chinese shipbuilders have begun work on eight subs, which will soon be handed over to its ally in South Asia.The new vessels will nearly double the number of submarines currently fielded by the Pakistani navy - increasing its underwater force from 10 subs to 18 - and mean it will have more than its rival India, which currently operates 16.The move, codenamed Project Hangor, is part of Beijing’s continued campaign to check India's influence in the region, Indian news network Zee News reports.News of the project comes as the rivalry between China and India continues to intensify as the world’s two most populous nations grapple for strategic control of the Indian Ocean and its highly lucrative shipping routes.

    In addition to cooperation on infrastructure, China and Pakistan have also launched a pair of high-tech satellites capable of surveying for resources and monitoring natural disasters.Fitted with wide-angle cameras, the PRSS-1 will also be used to provide data to the Chinese government on the vehicles making use of CPEC.The optical remote sensing satellites were purchased by Pakistan and launched into orbit from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northwest China.
