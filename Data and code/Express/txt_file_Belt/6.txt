GETTYA sign for the OBOR project in PakistanThe UK is under pressure from the Trump administration not to endorse the initiative that could usurp US influence in the area and negatively affect everything from trade to the US’s ability to apply pressure to Pakistan to curb terror networks travelling into Afghanistan to commit attacks.Professor Qing Wang Professor of Marketing & Innovation in China, at Warwick Business School told Express.co.uk that the UK is sending mixed messages to China.Ms Wang said: “The Belt and Road initiative is a design from the very top of the government, ie President Xi. Whether or not Theresa May wants to endorse this initiative, it will be considered insensitive to directly challenge it or being openly critical of it. Instead, she will need to find common areas of interest and establish mutual trust.“So far the UK government has been sending confusing signals to both the Chinese and at home as to what UK wants from China.“Theresa May needs to be consistent and be clear about her intentions if she wants to achieve anything with China which is undoubtedly becoming the most important trade partner for the UK post Brexit.” Photos show Chinese military enhanced missile power Wed, January 10, 2018A Chinese military newspaper has published new photos showcasing its short and medium-range missiles Play slideshow  PLA1 of 9

     Theresa May needs to be consistent and be clear about her intentions if she wants to achieve anything with China which is undoubtedly becoming the most important trade partner for the UK post BrexitProfessor Qing Wang, Warwick Business SchoolThe UK’s trade relationship with China is seen as lukewarm with British exports to China having risen 60 per cent since 2010, but falling well short of a target set by Gordon Brown in 2009 to double exports by 2013.Mrs May played down the problem, saying that the UK's relationship with China, “is already broad and deep and it delivers real benefits for both countries”. She said: “The depth of our relationship means we can have frank discussions on all issues.“We are working together to tackle global and regional security challenges such as North Korea, climate change and environmental pollution and to develop our strong bilateral trade, investment and cultural links.”Dr Fragkiskos Filippaios, Reader in International Business at the University of Kent, told Express.co.uk that China’s initiative is in effect an economic diplomacy tool.Dr Filippaios says that China has used the model in Africa with excellent results.   He said: ”It builds on three pillars - a significant amount of aid or very low-interest rate loans provided by China to the recipient country to build and develop its infrastructure. An assumption that the key contractors undertaking these infrastructure projects will be Chinese companies, in their vast majority state-owned enterprises. “Finally, a commitment of non-interference to the recipient country’s internal politics on behalf of the Chinese government.“The combination of these three factors make the scheme very attractive to any country, especially those with non-democratic regimes as it offers an alternative to World Bank’s development model that has usually attached democratisation conditions.”So why the concern? Dr Filippaios says that it is not PM May that is wary but the vast majority of developed countries’ political leaders.He said: “This initiative has the potential to significantly expand China’s economic and political influence in an area that is bordering with Europe.“China has already successfully penetrated a large number of African countries, rich in natural resources, and is not building stronger economic links with countries in Asia and Eastern Europe creating a trade route that will give Chinese companies access to a large number of markets.”
