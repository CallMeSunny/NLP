    Mr Chellaney, a former adviser to India's National Security Council, pointed to Sri Lanka, which, unable to pay back its loan from China, gave its Hambantota port to state owned China Merchant Port Holdings in a $1.1billion deal that many have deemed an erosion of sovereignty. And Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa and is also part of Belt and Road agreed to lease one of its military bases to Beijing for $20million in 2016. This became the first overseas post for China’s armed forces.China has also received a natural gas pipeline in Turkmenistan due to the initiative.Kenya is currently under threat of loosing its busy port of Mombasa, the gateway to East Africa, to China.
