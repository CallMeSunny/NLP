  POLESTARVolvo launches its new Polestar performance brand this weekThe Swedish firm invented the three-point seat belt and then generously gave away the patent to allow other car manufacturers to follow suit.It also had the first rear-facing child safety seat and was the first car maker to fit side impact bags.But of all its world firsts, the one on 5 July of this year will probably go down as its biggest.That was the date that Volvo announced that from 2019 every new car it introduces would have electric power of some description with five fully electric models launched by 2021.Volvo President Hakan Samuelsson says that he wants Volvo to be "leaders in electrification".And now the Swedish firm has gone one step closer to achieving that, with the launch this week of its new Polestar performance brand which will not only be electric-powered across all of its future models, but will also be innovative in the market in other ways too.An battery-powered rival to Porsche's 911, Polestar's cars will feature a light-weight carbon-fibre body (the same high-tech material used in Formula One cars) and also initially be sold exclusively via a subscription-only service similar to a leasing finance scheme.

POLESTARPolestar’s cars will feature a light-weight carbon-fibre bodyIt certainly looks the part too.The first model to arrive in late 2019 will be this gorgeous Polestar 1 two-door coupe, a plug-in hybrid that will boast the longest all-electric range of any hybrid car on the market of up to 100 miles.A secondary 2.0-litre supercharged and turbo-charged petrol engine allied to the two electric motors, gives the Polestar a mouth-watering combined output of 600bhp.That's enough to give it a 0 to 60mph time of under 4 seconds.Based on the same platform as the S90 saloon, it's around half a yard shorter, but the prominent front grille, sweeping roof line and elegant LED rear lights, means it really stands out. If you thought that Volvo's XC90 and XC60 were smart, then this Polestar 1 is something else again."Polestar 1 is the first car to carry the Polestar on the bonnet," says Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar CEO."A beautiful GT with amazing technology packed into it - a great start for our new Polestar brand. All future cars from Polestar will feature a fully electric drivetrain, delivering on our brand vision of being the new standalone electric performance model."

    But the Polestar 1 will need more than just startling performance and high-tech to succeed though in what's renowned for being a fickle and very trend-driven area of the market.Plus, the likes of BMW's 6-Series and Porsche 911 are two of the best Grand Tourers on the market and hardly pushovers - even if neither can match the Polestar 1's 600bhp.That said, at least the Polestar 1 will have exclusivity on its side.Volvo only plans to produce a maximum of 500 each year and they will only be sold via Polestar's retail outlets and not via a traditional Volvo car showroom (although they will be serviced there).Furthermore, that's 'sold' in the loosest possible term too, because you won't be able to buy the Polestar 1 outright, you will only be able to lease it on a subscription-only basis for two or three years.Similar to Volvo's forthcoming Care by Volvo system and numerous other manufacturer's 'Just Add Fuel' schemes that package together all your motoring costs (road tax, insurance, servicing) into one monthly sum, Polestar's goes one further and will include your original deposit, maintenance and also pick-up and delivery servicing.An app can also enable customers to temporarily hire items such as a roof box or a larger Volvo model as and when they need to for family holidays and the like.  POLESTARPolestar 1 will need more than just startling performance and high-tech to succeedQuite how customers will react to this new system of buying a car (or more to the point, [start itals] not [end itals] buying it) is another matter.When many new cars are now sold through purchase lease arrangements for two or three years, it certainly seems to make sense.Other manufacturers like Porsche are launching similar schemes too, so Volvo clearly isn't alone in its thinking.That said, Polestar Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Goodman won't rule out the possibility of selling future Polestar models outright as well as via this scheme.Ah yes, future models, this is just the start for Polestar.The second model, called imaginatively Polestar 2, will start production in late 2019 and be closer to the current Volvo S60 in size, while a third model, a larger 4x4 crossover, joins the range in 2021.   That's still some way off yet though as an all-new factory has still yet to be built in Chengdu, China.Its green credentials mean that it will be the most environmentally-friendly car factory in China.That's a crucial statement given that China is the world's largest car market and also the world's largest producer of electric vehicles.By 2030, Goldman Sachs is already estimating that China will account for 60 per cent of all hybrid and electric vehicle sales globally.While sales of alternatively-fuelled vehicles is undoubtedly on the rise in Europe, the numbers are eye-poppingly huge there with the Chinese Government aiming for production of 7 million hybrid and electric vehicles by 2025.It already has almost three times more charging points than the US.As all markets have found though, electric car sales often only really succeed when supported by Government subsidies and also by sufficient infrastructure for charging points.BMW has already taken that first step with its i8 supercar showing that battery power and sports car performance can go hand in hand.Volvo's new Polestar brand and this stunning new Polestar 1 look like they could be the next lesson for the industry.
