To get around Chinese exchange controls, rich and influential Chinese are buying Bitcoin to get out of their depreciating currency, which looks likely to keep falling in value."Bitcoin's recent surge came two days before China accelerated its devaluation process. This is no coincidence."Mr Chambers adds that in the old days to escape a devaluation of a currency, people would buy gold, but today bitcoin is the new gold and it is easier and cheaper to buy, safer to keep and much easier to get out of the country.He says that the bitcoin rally speaked by Chinese currency devaluation fears shows that bitcoin is "replacing gold as the asset of 'safe haven.'”  Bitcoin price LIVE: Wealthy Chinese turn to BTC?

And ultimately, that’s positive for the crypto space, because with volume comes legitimacy.”Read MORE: Bitcoin misses out on ‘$50k’ price spike with ETF uncertaintyJapanese traders know what's up!Earlier this week Japan's bond yields (blue line) had a massive spike on speculation that the Bank of Japan might take action.

Which is really bullish because when setting up an ETF you have to buy and store the underlying asset that you're leveraging/offering to clients."This is why we had the smack down to $5800 so the big boys could get their fill at a good price."The bottom is in now."Also now that there is a custodial service being provided with Coinbase, we are going to see some pretty big funds dive into this space now because they can buy Cryptos without messing about trying to store it etc."Coinbase is basically becoming a Crypto bank."  Bitcoin price LIVE: Brits not convinced (Image: GETTY)1.28pm - Brits not buying into bitcoin Research from a London investment house revealed that 38 percent - almost 20 million Brits - do not "understand" cryptocurrency, and one in three say the “bitcoin bubble” is set to burst.IW Capital - the Mayfair-based SME investment house - has shared exclusive research with Express.co.uk on the future of cryptocurrency investment in the UK.The report claims that ranging from sentiments of no confidence to not understanding what it is, the vast majority of the UK’s investor community believe it to be inferior to other forms of investment, and that the bitcoin bubble will soon burst.Key stats from the nationally representative sample of 2,007 respondents include 38 percent of those asked claiming not to understand cryptocurrency and a third of the UK believe that the bubble is set to burst.Luke Davis, CEO of IW Capital, said: "It is shocking, but not surprising, to see so much confusion around the topic of cryptocurrency. I do not believe this is a reflection of UK investors’ risk profile, as a positive appetite for alternative finance remains, but to see that investments have been made without proper financial advice and a lack of facts and education is very concerning.”Read MORE: Bitcoin NEWS: Brits still bristle at BTC ‘bubble’ - investment survey  Bitcoin price LIVE: ETFs ahead (Image: GETTY)1.53pm - ETF roadblockCoinfirm CEO Pawel Kuskowsk told Express.co.uk that a Bitcoin ETF will appeal to and bring into a whole new class of more traditional individual investors into the cryptocurrency space.He said: "The largest roadblock to mass adoption of crypto and blockchain sits mainly around regulations focused around AML/KYC and certain steps to be decided on by bodies like the SEC, whether it be what we are doing at Coinfirm with banks around the world or a Bitcoin ETF, each step like this is another step in the direction of blockchain mass adoption and therefore an upswing in the value of many cryptocurrencies."  Bitcoin price LIVE: CYBER crime (Image: GETTY)2.42pm - Cyber crime crypto updatePaolo Passeri, Cyber Intelligence Principal at Netskope has given us his latest take on the world of crypto-related cyber crime and the hacking of an Ethereum blockchain explorer called etherscan.io.He said: "On this occasion the attackers decided to just deface the site by injecting malicious code into a comment, so that a pop-up spelling out '1337' appeared in the browsers of visitors."This is an old-school statement used to indicate that a site had been breached. While the hacker seemed to be just having a little fun, the consequences could potentially have been much worse if the attacker had malicious intentions.”Mr Passeri warns that Blockchain explorers are like financial reporting sites for cryptocurrencies. He adds: "Imagine if an attacker artificially altered the values of coins to represent a sharp fall in price."This would cause panic and result in a mass selling off of these crypto coins. The attacker could take advantage of the panic and plummeting prices by purchasing the crypto coins in bulk before the manipulation is discovered and the market restored.”
