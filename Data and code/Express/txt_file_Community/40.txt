  REUTERSNorth Korea has reportedly caused its own earthquake by testing a hydrogen bombMassive eruptions were detected near the state’s main nuclear site before Pyongyang confirmed it carried out the test.Officials in South Korea claim the "artificial earthquake" is likely the result of tubby tyrant Kim Jong-un conducting yet another atomic test.The tremors from the 5.1 magnitude eruption were felt miles away from the Punggye-ri test site in the north east of the country.In a typically propaganda-heavy statement, it was claimed North Korea had boosted its "nuclear might to the next level" after testing a "miniaturised" hydrogen bomb.A hydrogen bomb can be up to 1000 times more powerful than the early atomic weapons that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

I think the first successful H-bomb test is a great national event."Ri Sol Yong, a 22-year-old university student, said the test gives the country “more national pride”.North Korea's announcement of successful hydrogen-bomb test is broadcast at #Pyongyang railway station pic.twitter.com/Ugd2NJQTrC— China Xinhua News (@XHNews) January 6, 2016  GETTYThe experiment could further damage relations between North Korea and the rest of the world   It is believed the test was conducted under the personal orders of Kim Jong-un - just two days before his birthday. While the claims from North Korea have yet to be verified, world leaders have already spoken out in outrage against the secretive state.Some experts have rubbished the claims and suggested the apparent blast which appeared on North Korean TV was too small for a hydrogen bomb.

      REUTERSSouth Korean President Park Geun-hye presides over the National Security Council in SeoulNorth Korea, which is currently under UN sanctions for its nuclear and missile programmes, has previously conducted three nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.Its last atomic test took place as Pyongyang looked to build a warhead apparently capable of reaching mainland America.Tensions between the totalitarian state and the US and United Nations would be further soured if a fourth atomic test is confirmed as having taken place.Scientific agency the US geological survey measured the seismic activity at 5.1 magnitude on the richter scale.The test in February 2013 led to a similar reading on the scale being recorded in the same area, around 30 miles north of Kilju and the site of all of North Korea’s previous nuclear tests.Earlier in the year, earthquakes measuring the same reading killed people in Pakistan and India.South Korea vowed a tough response to the bomb test as President Park Geun-hye summoned an emergency national security council meeting in Seoul.
