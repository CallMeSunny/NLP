It’s anonymous, and it’s cross-border.“If you legitimise it, you know who your counterparties are. The question is how many people will use it if you have to acknowledge you are a buyer or a seller.”  Bitcoin price LIVE: BlackRock New York (Image: GETTY)baseUrl="https://widgets.cryptocompare.com/";var scripts=document.getElementsByTagName("script");var embedder=scripts[scripts.length-1];(function(){var appName=encodeURIComponent(window.location.hostname);if(appName==""){appName="local"}var s=document.createElement("script");s.type="text/javascript";s.async=!0;var theUrl=baseUrl+'serve/v1/coin/multi?fsyms=BTC,ETH,XMR,LTC,DASH&tsyms=USD,EUR,CNY,GBP';s.src=theUrl+(theUrl.indexOf("?")>=0?"&":"?")+"app="+appName;embedder.parentNode.appendChild(s)})()Mr Fink, who oversees $6 trillion of assets said that bitcoin “is tiny in the scheme of financial markets,” adding that, “there’s too much focus on bitcoin."I don’t know why it has so much fascination for the press.”A spokesman from BlackRock told the Express.co.uk: “Like most financial institutions, BlackRock has a working group that meets periodically to exchange information on blockchain and consists of employees from various parts of the business."We have been looking at blockchain technology for several years, recognising potential for shared processes and data across market participants, clearing, settlement and reconciliation and simplified securities issuance.”Mr Fink is not the first major player in the money markets to seemingly change his tune on crypto.Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co described the technology as "a terrible store of value” in 2014 before moving senior staffer Oliver Harris into the role titled Head of Crypto-Assets Strategy in May this year.Got something to add?

    9.09am - BTC optimismJordan Hiscott, Chief Trader at ayondo markets told Express.co.uk after last week's price fall that nothing is so absolute.He said: "Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are an exciting venture and, in my opinion, are the perfect vehicle for a digitalized form of payment for the 21st century."Their virtues are clear to me; however, one important point resonates with me highly. Email was touted as the end to all letter writing due to ease of use, efficiency and lower cost in comparison, yet letters remain an important form of communication for many institutions and individuals."Technology has the ability to dramatically speed up the pace of change, but the human interaction and take up of these technologies is slower. Due to how dominating the current monetary system is, it means crypto and fiat currencies will work together going forward."   9.27am - Danger of the 51% attackEvgeny Chereshnev, CEO and founder at Biolink.Tech warned Express.co.uk that the liklihood of the once theoretical 51 percent attack is on the increase.A 51 percent attack is a potential attack on the bitcoin network whereby a dominant collective rewrites the rules imposed on the remaining 49 percent.In short, 51 percent group could just empty the wallets of the 49 percent into their own - theoretically speaking.He said: "Basically, if several bitcoin owners who control 51 percent of it as a group get together and agree to rewrite all of the bitcoin operations, they will be able to do that. They would have the power to decide which transactions get approved or not, who owns what."This is the same principal as a board of directors in an enterprise – when you have the majority vote, you can do whatever you want! Now imagine that you are a well-funded hacker team and you somehow managed to hack into several crypto exchange services and get 51 percent over time."Unlikely? Yes. Impossible? No."  Bitcoin price LIVE: Cyber crime alert (Image: GETTY)cont...Mr Chereshnev warns that, due to massive electricity costs, it’s economically inefficient for any private individual to mine cryptocurrency.He said: "Mostminers are basically working collectively. They build their own farms, but it’s very expensive to be able to buy this equipment and maintain profitability by paying their huge electricity bills!"So basically they unite together; everybody is mining as much as they can and they get paid proportionally according to the processing power they actually provide to the community."Most of those mining right now belongs to approximately five crypto farms, and most of them are in China which, right now, has the resources to pretty much own the blockchain.”  Bitcoin price LIVE: BTC up $100 (Image: GETTY)10.27am - BTC in the greenBitcoin is up $110 on the day so far with prices now at $6,461.11.44am - BTC even greenerBitcoin up $176 on the day so far with the price now at $6,526.Bitcoin started last week at $6,723 and a return could be on the cards.12.44pm - $8billion on the upIn just 24 hours, the crypto market has added $8 billion to its valuation.

Bitcoin price LIVE: BTC climbs $250 (Image: GETTY)1.18pm - BTC on the UP but it's NOT 'coming home'... yetBitcoin has gained nearly $300 so far in trading today as the recovery from last week’s price plunge gathers momentum. However, with England’s World Cup adventure now at an end, one expert says it’s all too soon to say that “bitcoin’s coming home” to $15k.Julian Hall, entrepreneur and the founder of ultra.education told Express.co.uk that despite the near 4 percent rise today, bitcoin and the English football team have a lot in common.He said: “Like betting on our sporting ambitions in the last week, is it too soon to say that ‘bitcoin is coming home’ to its lofty price of $15k?“Probably.”Read more HERE: BITCOIN soars $300 but it’s NOT ‘coming home’ to $15k yet, says expert   1.48pm - Kodak, KodcakThe BBC report that the company behind a Kodak-branded crypto-currency mining scheme has confirmed the plan has collapsed.In January, a bitcoin mining computer labelled Kodak KashMiner was on display on Kodak's official stand at the CES technology show in Las Vegas.However the crypto community labelled it a "scam" and said the advertised profits were unachievable and misleading.Now the company behind the scheme says it will not go ahead. Kodak told the BBC it was never officially licensed.  Bitcoin price LIVE: Russia link to US hack (Image: GETTY)2.49pm - Russian hackers and bitcoinAccording to a federal indictment Russian intelligence agents used bitcoin to pay for crucial elements of a campaign to sway the 2016 US election.CNN report that hackers working for the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence, hacked into the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the indictment says.The hackers allegedly used the controversial cryptocurrency to hide their identities as they leased servers in the US and Malaysia, registered website domains through which they released hacked information, and bought virtual private networks (VPNs) that obscured their identity.The indictment adds that the hackers bought bitcoin through peer-to-peer exchanges, using pre-paid credit cards, and using other digital currencies, allowing them to launder Kremlin money around the globe.  Bitcoin price live: BlackRock's move welcomed (Image: GETTY)3.00pm - How to bring in the next generation?Iqbal Gandham, UK MD at eToro, has told Express.co.uk that BlackRock's move marks an end to the "tired rhetoric" attached to crypto.He said: "Cryptoassets are a growing asset class and one which investors are increasingly keen to explore. Combined with the emerging world of tokenised securities, we have the perfect storm to create a new generation of investors as well as change the concept of investing itself."Hopefully with the traditional incumbents now entering the crypto space, we will see the conversation move forward from the tired rhetoric of Ponzi schemes and illicit behaviour, to focus on the more constructive question: how can we leverage this asset class to bring the next generation into investing?”
