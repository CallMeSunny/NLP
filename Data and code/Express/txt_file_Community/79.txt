   British forces united with France and the United States to bombard Syrian regime weapon facilities near Damascus and Homs following the alleged chemical attack carried out by Bashar al-Assad’s forces last week.Theresa May said the attacks were “limited and targeted” but were a warning to Russia.She said: “The action that took place last night was an action which was focused on degrading and deterring the operational capability and the willingness of the Syrian regime to continue to use chemical weapons."There have been many instances when we have seen them using those chemical weapons."But I believe it should also be a message to others that the international community is not going to stand by and allow chemical weapons to be used with impunity."The British prime minister has won backing from her senior ministers to take unspecified action with the United States and France to deter further use of chemical weapons.However, Jeremy Corbyn said today the actions were "legally questionable" and parliamentary consent should have been sought.Syrian state media said there had been a "violation of international law" and Russia has warned there will be "consequences".Here are all the latest updates and news live on the developing conflict as it happens.

Russia RAILS against Trump's Twitter: Relations can't depend tweets Sunday, April 159.55am: Russia warns of retaliation over attacksRussia’s Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov confirmed retaliation is on the cards after Saturday's bombing, with a bill proposing measures being introduced to the Russian Parliament this week.He said: “I will not announce anything, we are working on that.”9.34am: What happens next? Military experts give their viewsFormer head of the British Army Lord Dannatt said it was "wholly right" that Syria was subject to sanctions from the UK, US and France following the "appalling" use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime.He added inaction would have made the West look weak.Lord West, former head of the Royal Navy, also praised the West’s decision saying military action “had to be taken” and further action would be a “great big hammer” instead of a “pinprick”.But Professor Michael Clarke, counter-terrorism and defence expert, warns that retaliation could come in the form of “cyber warfare” - within the next two to three weeks.He said: ”I suspect Russia will choose not to respond in military terms. But cyber warfare is highly likely.""It will be an attack on national infrastructure, not just upsetting city firms, but getting inside the transport system, or the health system, or air traffic control. It could affect everyone."Mark Almond, director of the Crisis Research Institute in Oxford also said the strikes would not ease the conflict in the region.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, he said: “Bad relations could easily encourage a reckless Russian freebooter, prompted and paid by Iran, to try his luck getting revenge on the pockets of US and British forces operating in eastern Syria.”9.16am: British aid worker describes 'deafening explosions' during Syrian air raidsA British aid worker has described hearing "deafening explosions" and said the building she was in rattled when allied air strikes struck their Syrian targets.More than 100 missiles were fired in overnight raids on three facilities connected with the Syrian regime's chemical weapon programme on Saturday.Saturday, April 149.46pm: Aleppo blast blamed on 'explosives'Hezbollah has denied claims an Iranian military base was attacked by aircraft this evening.It has blamed explosives detonating in a warehouse.9.10pm: 'Blast' at military base in Aleppo after 'fighter jet attack'There are unconfimed reports an Iranian military base in Aleppo has been attacked by unidentified aircraft this evening.The base was in the Jabal Azzan region south of Aleppo, a Syrian government-controlled rural region.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, reported the blast but said the cause was unknown.8.20pm: Pence warns Syria of 'price to pay'US Vice President Mike Pence said today Syria would have a "price to pay" if its military conducts another chemical weapons attacks.At a Latin American summit in Lima, Peru, Mr Pence said President Trump "made clear that the United States of America is prepared to sustain this effort to reestablish the deterrent framework that exists in order that the Syrian regime and its patrons know there will be a price to pay if chemicals weapons are used again against men, women and children."7.35pm: Downing Street insists strikes were legalNumber 10 has published documents outlining the case for airstrikes against Syria amid questions over the attack’s legality from Moscow and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.In a summary of the advice given by Attorney General Jeremy Wright to Prime Minister Theresa May, Downing Street pointed the finger at Moscow over its role in leading the UK and its allies to decide to launch an attack on Bashar Assad's regime.It said international action to alleviate suffering caused by chemical weapons had been repeatedly blocked by Syria's allies.Diplomatic action, sanctions, and the US strikes against the Shayrat airbase in April 2017 have failed to sufficiently degrade Syria's chemical weapons capability, the document added.The paper said: ”There was no practicable alternative to the truly exceptional use of force to degrade the Syrian regime's chemical weapons capability and deter their further use by the Syrian regime in order to alleviate humanitarian suffering.”6.35pm: Russia resolution slamming ‘aggression’ rejected by UNThe UN Security Council rejected a Russian-drafted resolution today.The resolution would have condemned "the aggression against the Syrian Arab Republic by the US and its allies in violation of international law and the U.N. Charter."Only Russia, China and Bolivia voted in favour of the draft resolution.Eight countries voted against the draft, while four abstained.A resolution needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to pass.  AFP/GETTYUS Ambassador Nikki Haley at the UN6pm: Theresa May, Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron brand strikes “a success”A Downing Street spokesman said: "In separate calls, the Prime Minister this afternoon spoke with President Macron and President Trump."The three leaders agreed that the military strikes taken against the Syrian Regime's chemical weapons sites had been a success."The Prime Minister welcomed the public support which had been given by fellow world leaders for the strong stand the UK, France and the United States had taken in degrading Syria's chemical weapons capability and deterring their use, defending global rules, and sending a clear message that the use of chemical weapons can never become normalised."5.25pm: UK will 'take no lessons from Russia'UK ambassador Karen Pierce told the UN Security Council meeting there had been "clear boundaries" in the action that had been taken in an attempt to avoid escalation.She said repeated attempts to hold the Syrian regime to account had been met with Russian "obstruction and resistance"."We have repeatedly in this council attempted to overcome this obstruction, without success," she said."We are faced with a litany of violations, no sense of guilt, no sense of regret, no sense of responsibility, a shameful record wrapped in a mix of denial, deceit and disinformation."Ms Pierce added: "I will take no lessons in international law from Russia."4.55pm: US is ‘locked and loaded’ to strike Syria again if necessary, US Ambassador tells UN Security CouncilWith the UN Security Council meeting in full swing, the US Ambassador to the United Nations has told delegates her country will renew attacks if tested by Syria.She said: “ We are confident that we have crippled Syria's chemical weapons program. We are prepared to sustain this pressure, if the Syrian regime is foolish enough to test our will."If the Syrian regime uses this poison gas again, the United States is locked and loaded.”3.49pm: Russia asks UN Security Council to condemn last night’s allied attack, draft paper showsRussian officials have called on the United Nations Security Council to condemn "the aggression against the Syrian Arab Republic by the U.S. and its allies in violation of international law and the U.N. Charter."It was not immediately clear when it could be put to a vote.Diplomats said it was unlikely to get the minimum nine votes needed to force a veto by the United States, France or Britain.A resolution needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to pass.3.40pm: Russian Foreign Minister calls military assaults by US, UK and France ‘unacceptable and lawless’Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s Foreign Minister, has cast doubt on France’s assertions that it has proof that a chemical attack took place in Douma, calling yesterday’s air strikes ‘unacceptable and lawless’.Mr Lavrov said: "They [France] said the facts were incontrovertible [for the chemical attack in Douma], but said they could not share them with us.”He went on to say if evidence was proven then "Russia would be the first to want to stop such an attack". Syria air strikes latest pictures: US, UK and France attack Damascus Sun, April 15, 2018The United States, France and Britain have launched military strikes in Syria to punish President Bashar Assad for an apparent chemical attack against civilians and to deter him from doing it again.

    2.49pm: No known casualties of Syrian bombing and attacks not intended to 'depose' Syrian regime, says PentagonLieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie said there have been no civilian casualties as far as the Pentago is aware.He said: "None of our aircraft or missiles involved in this operation were successfully engaged by Syrian air defences."Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said the airstrikes had been launched to "cripple Syria's ability to use chemical weapons in the future" and had "successfully hit every target".She insisted the strikes did not "represent a change in US policy or an attempt to depose the Syrian regime" and that the US focus was to defeat the Islamic State terror group.But, she added: "We cannot allow such grievous violations of international law."2.27pm: Pentagon briefing underway - targets were 'precise, overwhelming and effective', says General McKenzieLieutenant General Kenneth F. McKenzie of the US Department of Defense is giving a press briefing at the Pentagon on Saturday’s Syrian missile strikes.He said: “We selected these targets carefully to avoid civilian casualties... and they were successfully hit."He added: "I'd use three words to describe this operation - precise, overwhelming and effective."However, the general added that the chemicals weapons stash in Syria is bigger than the three areas targeted in the bombing.

The UK Prime Minister is accountable to Parliament, not to the whims of a US president."I believe the action was legally questionable, and this morning the UN Secretary-General has said as much, reiterating that all countries must act in line with the UN Charter."You assured me that the Attorney General had given clear legal advice approving the action. I would therefore be grateful if you would publish this advice in full today."1.55pm: Donald Trump congratulates France and UK on ‘perfectly executed strike’President Trump has woken up and has been back on Twitter to praise the military forces involved in Saturday’s bombing of Syria.He tweeted: “A perfectly executed strike last night.

The Russian parliament is often used to send assertive messages to foreign states, but these do not always translate into concrete measures.10.58am update: German foreign ministry issues statement to allies A German foreign ministry spokeswoman says the world must assume that not all chemical weapons in Syria were destroyed.
