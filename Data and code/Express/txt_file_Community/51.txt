   As the Earth warms up there will be less chance to quench your thirst with a cool pint of the amber nectar unless you are prepared to pay for it.Poor barley crops which are a key ingredient in making a pint could see the amount of beer brewed slump while prices rocket.In the UK, beer consumption could fall by between 0.65 billion and 2.34 billion pints (0.37 to 1.33bn litres) while the price could as much as double.So drinkers in the capital now paying over a £5 could face eye watering price hikes while the average UK price of £3.60 a pint could hit over £7.

Beer drinkers face huge price hikes with UK heatwave to blame Scientists warn prices will go up the most in such wealthy, beer-loving countries as Belgium, Canada, Denmark and Poland.For example during severe drought years, Irish beer drinkers could need to pay the equivalent of an extra £15 or $20 to buy a six-pack from an off licence.Consumption in the US could also decrease between 1.08 billion and 3.48 billion litres because of widespread and severe drought and heatwaves.Professor of climate change economics Dabo Guan at the the University of East Anglia said: "Increasingly research has begun to project the impacts of climate change on world food production, focusing on staple crops such as wheat, maize, soybean, and rice.
