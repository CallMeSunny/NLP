   The Scottish Tory party leader called on the government to get their act together as Prime Minister Theresa May attempted to stamp her authority on her party and the cabinet during the four-day conference, having lost her parliamentary majority with a botched election gamble in June.But Mrs May spent most the opening day of the Tory Party conference dodging questions on whether she will fire her Foreign Secretary.The Manchester conference has so far been dominated by discussion of Boris Johnson's leadership ambitions, after he set out his own personal red lines for Brexit negotiations and issued a call for higher public sector pay rises.Today’s keynote speeches have been focused on “building a strong economy” featuring Chancellor Philip Hammond and David Gauke, the Work and Pensions Secretary.Mr Hammond delivered his big seech on the second day of the Tory conference today, but earlier sent a warning shot to Mr Johnson saying "nobody is unsackable" during a TV interview this morning. Mrs May begun the Tory Party conference yesterday by announcing that tuition fees will not be subject to inflation and will instead be frozen at the current level of £9,250 until 2019.Follow Express.co.uk for live updates on the Tory conference below   GETTY Theresa May arrives for the second day of the Tory conference  Related articles   Czexit next?

I think it needs to get over its current nervous breakdown and man up a bit."Once again Ms Davidson was forced to deny she will be switching jobs. She said she is "regularly behind the door at Number 10" which means she does not want to take officer. Ms Davidson added: "It honestly looks like the loneliest job in the world," In a reference to the row over Mr Johnson's comments, Ms Davidson - touted as a potential successor to Mrs May - used a conference fringe event to tell her MSPs: "If any of you think of writing anything, without telling me, that is counter to current Scottish Conservative policy; you are out on your ear because nobody is unsackable."She said Mr Johnson had insisted that his comments had been in line with Mrs May's policy but added: "If I was able to interpret the actions, and the thought process behind the actions of the Foreign Secretary, then I think I could make a better living doing that than I do now."2:26pm update: A conference held by Jacob Rees-Mogg has descended into chaos after protesters mobbed the high-profile backbencher.Demonstrators holding up placards chanted "Tories out" at the packed meeting on Brexit.Conservative supporters returned fire, shouting "Labour scum".One angry protester told him: “Abortion rights, women’s rights, austerity.. everythng. You’re a despicable person.”To which, Mr Rees-Mogg replied: “Well, we may disagree on things but just because you disagree with somebody, that doesn’t make them a bad person. “The two are separate.” Mr Rees-Mogg was mobbed by a couple of protesters who harangued him directly about his views on abortion.The MP for North East Somerset, speaking from a lectern, appealed for calm. He said:"Ladies and gentlemen, let us have a proper and thoughtful debate."   GETTY May and her husband clap in applause for Hammond 1:55pm update: Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon joined his Cabinet colleagues in slapping down Mr Johnson, saying he had agreed to a transition period of "around two years" at a Cabinet meeting before Mrs May's Florence speech.He dismissed the Foreign Secretary's demand that it should last "not a second more" as a "relatively minor issue" and stressed "none of us are unsackable".Sir Michael told BBC Radio 4's World At One: "I think some of the noises off actually are about a relatively minor issue about whether the transition period is two years or two years and one month or whatever."He predicted Mr Johnson would remain loyal in his Tuesday speech to the party conference.Sir Michael said: "I think you'll find tomorrow, when he speaks to the conference, he will make it very clear that he is party to our negotiations with Europe, he was there at the Cabinet meeting that endorsed the Florence speech, he had every opportunity to contribute to that speech, he agreed then the timetable of around two years.""And I think you'll find tomorrow he will set out how he wants to help the Prime Minister and the rest of the team achieve a successful Brexit because that's what all of us want, whichever way we voted."Sir Michael added: "This Prime Minister has the support of the Parliamentary Party, she has the support of the Cabinet."Asked if she would last in the job until the next election, he replied: "I believe so, yes."1:51pm update: Mr Hammond's speech gained a lukewarm reception from business groups, who welcomed his defence of free markets but said he had failed to deliver enough "red meat" on how to revive the economy.CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said: "Our economy is under threat - it has moved from the top of the G7 to the bottom. The solution must be for responsible business and government to grow our way out of austerity. But this can only happen with clarity, unity and action. Today's speech was only one step in that direction."And Stephen Martin, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said: "There was little red meat for business leaders today, and if (the Chancellor) wants to unleash the nation's potential, he must use the Budget to boost investment by individuals and companies."Shadow chancellor Mr McDonnell said Mr Hammond was "continuing down the path of his predecessor and clinging to an old economic model that fails the many".The Chancellor's reliance on "baseless smears" against Labour "betrays how fearful the Tories are of the challenge posed by Jeremy Corbyn", said Mr McDonnell.Mr Hammond's announcement of £400 million for northern infrastructure was "a drop in the ocean" compared with cuts inflicted by his Government, while the extension of Help To Buy would benefit "only a few".Mr McDonnell added: "There was nothing of real substance on infrastructure, on tackling the housing crisis, the funding shortfall in our NHS and care system, and nothing at all for hard-working families who are struggling to keep up with rising prices."  GETTY Jacob Rees-Mogg is at Monday's Tory party conference 12:38pm update: Hammond has concluded his long-awaited speech by praising the Tories as the "most successful political organisation in history". In a rousing speech, the Chancellor promised to deliver to the next generation and “re-fight” a battle to ensure Britain’s prosperity is not at risk. He said: "So Conference, we will deliver a Brexit that works for Britain and in doing so, we will unleash our nation’s potential."We have a fundamentally strong economy. We’re rebalancing our public finances. We’re addressing the productivity gap. We’re investing in Britain’s future. But we hear the concerns of a generation that feels excluded from the opportunities their parents enjoyed."We hear the concerns of millions of households, impatient at the long slog back from Labour’s recession. We hear them and we will respond to them."But we can only do so by harnessing the power of the market economy to deliver a brighter future. And that means re-fighting a battle we thought we had won against an opposition determined to put Britain’s prosperity at risk."We will not let that happen. We will not allow Britain’s prosperity to be threatened, our security to be undermined. We will take on the false promises of Corbyn’s Labour and one by one we will expose them for the fallacies that they are. We will not allow the past to triumph over the future. We will not allow the politics of fear to trump the politics of progress."Conference, the Conservative party is the most successful political organisation in history, flexible and adaptable, responding to a changing world. But resolute and unmoving in its principles and values."We will see off this threat to our fundamental freedoms. We will deliver on our promise to the next generation."We will do it together. And we will do it for Britain."  REUTERS Andrea Leadsom listens to Hammond as he delivers his conference speech 12:37pm: Hammond has praised Mrs May for “substantial achievements” at the election by comparing her to Angela Merkel. He said: "A Conservative prime minister returned to Number 10 in 2017 with our biggest share of the vote for 30 years. And at 43 per cent, Theresa May won a clearer, stronger mandate in the popular vote in Britain than Angela Merkel in Germany."12:31pm update: Hammond has now turned to Brexit where he admits the vote has created "uncertainty". He called on the Government to remove this uncertainty. He said: "The process of negotiating our exit from the EU has created uncertainty so investment has slowed as businesses wait for clarity."So before we can reap the benefits of our strong economic fundamentals and the investment we are making in the future we must remove this uncertainty." Insisting that Britain has a "bright future" ahead, he said the Tory party must be "clear-eyed" about the challenges along the way. He told the conference: "And as we tread that terrain, we need the path well-lit; the hazards well signposted."The future prize is great. If we get this right – Britain will have a bright future beyond Brexit. But to get to it, we must be clear-eyed about the challenges along our way."  PA Hammond has told Corbyn to 'bring it on' 12:29pm update: The Conservative Party will also spend an extra £10billion on the Help to Buy scheme, which will help an estimated 130,000 hombuyers. Mr Hammond said: "As Conservatives, we have always supported young people and families to achieve their dreams of home ownership. Our “help to buy ISA”, launched in 2015, has helped more than a million people to save for their own home."And “Help to Buy: Equity Loan” has achieved much higher take-up than we expected, helping 130,000 families so far with a deposit for their own home."This morning, the Prime Minister and I have visited two of them in their new home in Salford, hearing first-hand how Help to Buy made their dream of home ownership come true. But that success means the original funding allocated to the scheme will run out before the scheme was expected to end."So today, I can announce an extra £10bn in funding to provide loans under the scheme through to 2021. Helping an estimated 130,000 more homebuyers over the next few years."Renewing our Conservative commitment to Britain’s property owning democracy for the next generation." 12:22pm update: Hammond has confirmed that the Tory party is ploughing £300million into transport in the north He said: "Opening up derelict land for development for housing and for jobs. Connecting our communities to make them more productive."And so today I am announcing a further £300m to future-proof the railway network in the north, ensuring HS2 infrastructure can link up with future Northern Powerhouse and Midlands Rail projects while keeping open all options for services through Manchester Piccadilly." 12:18pm update: Hammond was keen to reassure party members that the UK economy was "fundamentally strong". He said: "Conference, our economy is not broken: it is fundamentally strong. And while no one suggests a market economy is perfect, it is the best system yet designed for making people steadily better off over time and underpinning strong and sustainable public services for everyone."As this model comes under renewed assault, we must not be afraid to defend it."The market economy frees people and businesses, encourages them to create, take risks, give ideas a go because they can see the results and benefit from their success.  GETTY May listens to the Chancellor's big speech11:56am update: Philip Hammond has started off his speech with a joke by saying what a privilege it is to be in Mancheser,"but all of us united" in an apparent nod to Tory infighting. In a strong start, the chancellor said the Tories must take on the Labour Party and defeat them. He said: "I promise you this: we will defeat them by the power of our argument ... by the logic of history." Hammond said it was time for Theresa May’s government to offer a better way forward as Labour abandons the centre ground of British politics. He called for the Tories to make a commitment to the next generation that their children will be better off, adding: “That is the Conservative definition of progress”.Hammond challenged Mr Corbyn to "bring it on" as he accused the Labour leader of backing Marxist policies which would take the country back to the 1970s.He said: "I think we owe it to the next generation to show that Corbyn's Marxist policies will inevitably lead us back to where Britain was in the late 1970s. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester he said Labour had become "a party taken hostage by a clique of hard-left extremist infiltrators, people who despise Britain's values and talk down our country".The Labour conference in Brighton had shown a "resolutely negative agenda of failed ideas dredged up from a bygone era, threatening not only our economic progress but our freedom as well", Mr Hammond claimed.He said: "They say politics is about the clash of ideas, so we say to Corbyn: bring it on."Let them put their arguments, let them make their case, we will take them on and we will defeat them."  EPA Hammond is speaking in Manchester 11:40am update: Alun Cairns has hit out at Carwyn Jones, saying he is power-obsessed and spends most of his time seeking to divide the UK.The Conservative frontbencher hit out at the Welsh First Minister as he advised his own party to not "devolve and forget" but "come together" to support the UK Government's Brexit strategy led by Mrs May and Brexit Secretary Mr Davis.Mr Cairns, speaking at the Tory party conference in Manchester, said Labour in Wales is "pursuing an agenda" which aims to "derail" Brexit despite a majority of Welsh voters backing Leave at the 2016 EU referendum.He told party members: "At a time when our economic interests need to be our priority, when we should be reaching out to new markets, securing new trading opportunities and increasing our exports, the First Minister is obsessed with process, bureaucracy and power."But we will not give in to pressure to make decisions that are in the interest of politicians rather than the people they serve."His most recent demands are around a constitutional convention, more joint ministerial committees, another Wales Bill, his role in Brexit negotiations and calls for federal frameworks and structures at every stage. But it's not about him."He seems to spend most of his time working with the nationalists in Scotland seeking to divide the UK, rather than working in the interests of every constituent part."  GETTY Theresa May, Philip Hammond and Sajid Javid visit Rebecca Coulton’s home in Manchester 11:24pm update:  Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke said the rollout of Universal Credit will not be paused. He told the Tory Party conference he would tweak the system to ensure claimants are offered advance payments upfront, amid criticism people are waiting six weeks for any money and getting into debt.But he insisted the "rollout will continue" despite pressure for a pause from a dozen Tory MPs, as well as Labour and a number of charities.It comes after Mr Hammond claimed that Universal Credit created "challenges" for claimants who find themselves waiting weeks for their first payments.But in his speech in Manchester, Mr Gauke said: "Universal Credit is working."So I can confirm that the rollout will continue, and to the planned timetable."We're not going to rush things, it is more important to get this right than to do this quickly, and this won't be completed until 2022."But across the country, we will continue to transform our welfare system to further support those who aspire to work."Universal Credit combines a number of benefits such as housing benefit and tax credits into a single payment.From October the pace of its rollout is due to be ramped up, with 50 Jobcentres moving to the service every month from October.Government figures show 23% of new claimants do not receive their first full payment within six weeks, which has been linked to rent arrears and other debts for claimants.Mr Gauke said he understood the concerns, adding that people can get advance payments to tide them over.He said: "I am determined to ensure that those who need support earlier in the month will get it. "I can announce today that we are refreshing the guidance to DWP staff to ensure that anyone who needs an advance payment will be offered it upfront."Claimants who want an advance payment will not have to wait six weeks. They will receive this advance within five working days."People with an immediate need will have their payments fast-tracked, Mr Gauke added.He called Universal Credit the most radical reform to welfare since the Second World War, ensuring that work pays for claimants.But the implementation has been criticised by the likes of Dame Louise Casey, the former head of the Government's troubled families team, as well as former Treasury mandarin Lord Macpherson and charity Citizens Advice.Twelve Tory MPs also sent a letter to Mr Gauke urging him to pause the expansion, according to the Daily Telegraph.In his speech, Mr Gauke revealed that twice as many people than originally thought are set to benefit from plans not to reassess people with the most severe conditions for employment and support allowance, the main long-term sickness benefit.He added that 1,800 work coaches had been trained to support claimants with mental health issues, amidst criticism Jobcentre staff found it daunting dealing with them.  PA David Gauke speaks at the Manchester conference 11:11am update: Britain will be able to export more pigs' ears after Brexit, the Environment Secretary has claimed.Michael Gove said leaving the EU would enable UK farmers to do away with ear tags and introduce their own "traceability methods" on livestock.He told a fringe event at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester that sales of unpierced pigs' ears could increase following Brexit, meaning there would be more bacon, pork and ham for British consumers.Mr Gove said exporting was part of "making sure that we can provide more for our home market", and that he had been talking to farmers in Northern Ireland about tastes for different cuts of pig."There are some cuts of the animal that are hugely popular with the British consumer, others a little less."But some of those cuts are hugely popular elsewhere, say, for example, pigs' ears are a delicacy in China."He said "one of the reasons" why Britain has not been "as successful as we might have been at selling pigs' ears to China is that EU rules dictate that pigs, like all livestock, have ear tags".Mr Gove, who had a bacon sandwich at the breakfast discussion, said Britain could have its "own traceability methods" outside the EU, and said: "And as a result we can have pigs' ears that don't need to be pierced"Unpierced pigs' ears are worth more."We will have a fair, competitive advantage - we can sell more pigs' ears to China and that means there can be more bacon and pork and ham from the other joints of the animal that are popularly sold here."So by selling more sows' ears to China we can buy more silk purses for British farmers."  REUTERS Hammond and his wife have been pictured walking to the Tory conference 10:49am update: Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said the tory government’s decision to axe tolls on the Severn edges would boost the economy in south Wales by around £100million a year. He said: "No other policy will have such an immediate impact on growing the economy in south Wales and the south west of England than our decision to abolish the tolls on the Severn crossings."After 50 years of having to pay to enter Wales, I’m grateful to my Cabinet colleagues, particularly Chris Grayling who understood the significance of this policy."The announcement has been one of my proudest moments as secretary of state."25 million vehicles cross the bridges every year, with a cost of up to £20 a time."Anyone living and working in south Wales, knows how important this. Just think – no tolls, no booths, no charges, no long queues to get into Wales."This decision will immediately boost the economy of south Wales by £100m a year."And we all have something to offer that benefits the whole of the UK."  REUTERS Alun Cairns speaks in Manchester 10:38am update: Theresa May has paid her respects to the victims of the Las Vegas shooting from Manchester.A tweet from the UK Prime Minister Twitter account read: "The UK's thoughts are with the victims and the emergency services responding to the appalling attack in Las Vegas."10:34am update: Theresa May's effective deputy prime minister has stressed the need for flexibility in Brexit negotiations - putting him at odds with the red lines set out by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.First Secretary of State Damian Green suggested that the "implementation period" after leaving the EU could last a few months longer than the two-year period suggested by the Prime Minister.He also refused to rule out paying for continued access to the European single market after leaving the bloc.Asked what an appraisal of Mr Johnson's ministerial performance might say, Mr Green said: "Boris is doing what Boris has always done - adding to the gaiety of nations."At a fringe event at the conference in Manchester, Mr Green said the implementation period could go beyond two years for some parts of the economy.He said: "The phrase the Prime Minister used was 'around two years' but that means a few months either way."He added that could mean "instead of the end of March it's the end of June" 2021 and the Government was not committing to two years "to the minute".  REUTERS Ruth Davidson listens to David Mundell speak during the Tory conference 10:22am update: Scottish secretary David Mundell has praised Theresa May for her "now is not the time" response to Nicola Sturgeon's rallying cry for a second independence referendum. He called on Ms Sturgeon to extinguish her plans for a second vote to see Scotland break away from the UK. Mr Mundell said: "Instead of addressing the declining standards in Scotland's schools, instead of tackling the pressures and missed targets that dog Scotland's NHS, instead of building our way out of Scotland's growing housing crisis, Nicola Sturgeon subjected Scotland to a year of political game-playing as she sought to turn the EU referendum into an excuse for a second independence poll."I'm glad the election result finally forced her to put her constitutional campaign on hold."He pointed to the "democratic decision" of the independence referendum in 2014 and will say the truth is the SNP will always seek another poll on the matter.Mr Mundell said: "We're told a second independence referendum is on the back burner."Well, it's time Nicola Sturgeon took a fire extinguisher to it so Scotland can get on with what really matters."I hope she takes the opportunity to do so at her party's conference in a few days' time."If she won't, we will. No-one else. Week in week out we see Scottish Labour flip-flopping on the constitution."The only way to guarantee the threat of a second independence referendum is swept off the table once and for all is to install Ruth Davidson as Scotland's first minister."He also joked Ruth Davidson should have a "oh Ruth Davidson" song after the Scottish election result.   REUTERS Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell speaks at the Conservative Party's conference in Manch10:11am update: Labour's John McDonnell has responded to Mr Hammond's Help to Buy plans. He tweeted: "Hammond is willing to borrow to help a few own a home, but not to actually help the many have a home & he’s on the run over tax rises."9:48am update: Mr Hammond has also taken the opportunity to take a swipe at Jeremy Corbyn saying his economic plans were more responsible than the Labour leader’s. He said “What Jeremy Corbyn is proposing to do is to borrow large amounts of money simply to pour into public spending, to forgive existing debts, to give people handouts. “He is offering people promises that simply cannot sustainably be delivered."

PA May arrives for the second day of the Tory conference with her husband Philip 9:09am update: Ahead of his big speech today, Chancellor Philip Hammond sent a thinly-veiled warning to Boris Johnson amid speculation that the Foreign Secretary is trying to destabilise Theresa May, declaring "nobody is unsackable".Mr Hammond flatly denied reports that he had offered Mr Johnson his support as leader in an early-morning text as the disastrous results of the June 8 election became clear and affirmed his "10 per cent support" for Mrs May. Although he was in text and phone contact with Cabinet colleagues during the night, he told Good Morning Britain: "I did not text Boris Johnson during that morning and offer him my support."Asked whether Mr Johnson should be sacked, the Chancellor told ITV's Good Morning Britain: "We all serve at the Prime Minister's pleasure and we all owe the Prime Minister our allegiance and our loyalty within the Cabinet."I have always operated on the principle that it is probably best to believe that nobody is unsackable. Everybody has got to pull their weight within the Government."   EPA Boris has been spotted on an early morning jog 9.01am update: A sprightly Boris Johnson has been spotted on a morning jog with the editor of The Sun newspaper, Tony Gallagher. It remains unknown whether the foreign secretary will say anything to steal the limelight of the chancellor. He earlier expressed surprise that his article stating the Brexit transition period should last "not a second more" than two years had overshadowed the first day of the Manchester conference, squeezing out Mrs May's attempts to make a pitch to younger voters.The Foreign Secretary told the Daily Telegraph: "I think, actually, if you studied what I said, it was basically Government policy. I think it's extraordinary that so much fuss has been made about repeating Government policy, but there you go."8:55am update: Theresa May has arrived for the second day of the Tory conference in Manchester alongside her husband Philip.
