    Britain and America had led the Allies to victory in two world wars and the West through the Cold War, confronting and defeating communism “not just through military might but by winning the war of ideas”.British and American leadership through the Special Relationship had not just overcome war and adversity but had also made the modern world.The two countries had also inspired the establishment of international organisations including Nato and World Bank.Mrs May urged America under President Trump to “take up the mantle of leadership again” and to renew the Special Relationship.She told the Republicans that Mr Trump’s election victory was an opportunity to put their values of nationhood, family, patriotism, economic prudence and putting power in the hands of the people at the heart of American renewal.   An emboldened and confident America was good for the world, she said.And a nation that was strong and prosperous at home could lead abroad, she said.Britain would rebuild confidence as the country left the EU, she said.“As we end our membership of the European Union we have the opportunity to reassert our belief in a confident, sovereign Great Britain - a global Britain read to build relations with old and new friends alike,” the Prime Minister said.She forecast that the UK will “step up” to an even more internationalist role, cooperating with allies and projecting British values around the world.Britain would also be among the “most forceful advocates of business, free markets and free trade” anywhere across the world.In the age of change and renewal, Britain and America had a responsibility to “lead together again”.She warned about threats facing the world including radical Islam and a resurgent and aggressive Russia.She welcomed the economic rise of the east led by China and India but admitted some feared “the eclipse of the West” as a result.The Prime Minister ruled out a return to the failed interventions of the past.
