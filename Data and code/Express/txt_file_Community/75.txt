    var brightcoveBrandsafety='' Sterling is stuck at $1.29 and has struggled in its performance this week as MPs returned from their Easter break and Theresa May once again tried unsuccessfully to convince them to back her unpopular Brexit deal. The growing concern over the impasse and the prospect of another Scottish independence vote has caused the pound to suffer. On Wednesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced plans for a fresh independence poll before May 2021.  Related articles   May sets new deadline with Britons to vote in EU elections – ‘GREAT...   ‘Arrogant and DISHONEST’ - Farage TAUNTS Adonis Chris Turner, head of foreign exchange strategy at ING, said: “Renewed debate about the choice of currency for an independent Scotland will rekindle uncertainty. Sterling risks $1.2800 in the current strong dollar environment.”Sterling edged 0.3 percent higher to $1.2932, its weakest since mid-February, and it traded flat at 86.3 pence against the euro. On a weekly basis, it is set to decline 0.6 percent, which represents its biggest loss in four weeks. The dollar, which rose towards a two-year high on an index of major currencies, also weighed on the pound.

Concerns over the Brexit deadlock and a second Scottish referendum has hit the pound hard (Image: GETTY)His Brexit Party is already forecast for a landslide victory in many leading polls, when Britons cast their vote on May 23.Mr Farage said: "We want the European election to be the first step of a massive change that resets entirely British politics and actually makes it look more like the country."MPs will realise that if they carry on trying to stop Brexit, they'll lose their seats at the next General Election. I think they will be very fearful of what the Brexit Party can do to them.Read below for the latest updates on Brexit.

Mr Starmer said the New IRA's apology was 'completely despicable' (Image: GETTY)8.17pm update: Gavin Esler says if government delivers Brexit Britain will become ‘Trumpland’Ex-BBC presenter Gavin Esler who is standing as an MEP for the Remain-backing party Change UK said if the government delivers Brexit it would turn Britain into “a kind of Trumpland’. The former journalist who spent 40 years working for the BBC joins Rachel Johnson, the sister of future Tory leadership hopeful Boris, on the field of candidates put forward by Change UK, just two months after the group was set up. The party which has dubbed itself the “Remain Alliance” is contesting all 70 seats in Britain. Mr Esler, 66, is determined to help his new party prevent the UK from leaving the EU. In an interview with the Evening Standard, Mr Esler, said: “If you let people who have proved to be not telling the truth and (who are) incompetent get away with Brexit, then we are entering a kind of Trumpland.”Change UK was set up in February by seven MPs who defected from the Labour Party. They were later joined by another Labour MP and three Tory MPs. One of the group’s main aims is to “stop Brexit”.   Mr Esler, 66, delivers a speech at Change UK's launch of its European election campaign (Image: GETTY)4.10pm update: Brexit will not give rise to white supremacy in UK, says pro-diversity groupBritain’s departure from the EU will not give rise to white supremacy, a pro-diverse group of writers have said. All in Britain, which comprises people from different ethnic and social backgrounds, said in a statement it is high time the UK woke up to the fact that many BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) voters want to sever ties with Brussels. The group seized on Channel 4’s presenter Jon Snow’s comments when he said “I have never seen so many white people in one place” while covering a Leave Means Leave rally. All in Britain said: “He was signalling to his audience that there is an inherent racism in the Leave vote, and by implication, the direction that Britain is heading in.” The group called for people to acknowledge and admit the presence of BAME voters among the 17.1 million who voted to divorce from the EU. The group also praised Nigel Farage for fielding a diverse array of candidates in next month’s EU elections. In a statement released on Friday it said: “The Brexit Party list looks remarkably ethnically diverse, especially when compared to that of the Remain-oriented, Change UK. “Whatever you think of Brexit as a policy decision for the country, surely the sight of so many articulate and committed BME Brexiteers is enough to shake the certainty that leaving the EU represents the rise of white supremacy in Britain.”  All in Britain said Leave voters were not only white but many BAME voters wanted Brexit also (Image: GETTY)3.45pm update: Economist warns UK must be far away from EU when ‘bomb explodes’A German economist has warned Britain should be far away from the EU when an economic “bomb” explodes which he predicts will happen in the future. In an interview with RT Deutsch, Dr Markus Krall said if he was British he would have voted for Brexit as it is the most “logical” decision. Dr Krall blamed the European Central Bank for creating a “big and pretty powerful monetary bomb” by its policies. He said: “One should be far, far away when the bomb explodes, which is what the Brits are doing at the moment.“The monetary bomb the ECB has created for us is unfortunately pretty big and pretty powerful, also because they have been working on it for a long time.”  Dr Krall said if he was British he would have voted for Brexit (Image: NC)3.20pm update: Nearly 600 candidates running in EU elections The number of candidates standing in the EU elections is 31 percent higher than the last time Great Britain took part in the polls in 2014. A total of 580 people are running as MEPs in the May 23 European parliament elections -
