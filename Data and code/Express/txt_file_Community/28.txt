   Japan’s Blockchain Association and the Cryptocurrency Business Association are planning on forming a self-regulatory board to prevent future hacks, it has been claimed.The country’s Blockchain Association and the Cryptocurrency Business Association could merge as early as April, according to sources close to the matter.On Wednesday, Coindesk reported the US Treasury’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence had “called on the international community for stronger cryptocurrency regulations to help protect the financial system and national security in a speech yesterday”.And even stronger language has emerged in recent weeks from nations such as India and South Korea, where a purported ban from Seoul led the cryptocurrencies markets to plummet in January.

EXCLUSIVE SURVEY Will cryptocurrencies be made illegal in 2018?Adrian Markey, Chartered Account and Crypto Tax Specialist, said the threat of banning cryptocurrencies this year is real.Speaking exclusively to Express.co.uk, he said: “It’s definitely possible that countries will ban it. But I think it would be pretty short-sighted for them to do that.“Even if they don’t make it illegal, what they could do is loot it to the extent that if you legislate it or regulate it, you are kind of almost defeating the purpose of taking that power of regulation and the power of being the trusted third party away from the banks.“You are disposing of one of the cultural aspects that people like about blockchain.”  GETTYBitcoin news: Will cryptocurrencies be made illegal in 2018?Just this week, Citibank India became the latest lender to bar customers from using debit or credit cards to buy virtual currencies such as bitcoin.Mr Markey said crypto regulation was most likely to come from India “as they seem to the furthest along in the process” amid pressure from the finance sector.He said: “The banks are the ones that stand to lose the most from people transitioning from the current model of the bank, as the authorising central authority for payments, to what bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer which is cutting out that middle man and instead trusting the network of computers or miners that essentially authorise those payments.“If you take that environment with the banks and say India, is that what is driving it, perhaps in that the banks don’t want to be the ones that suffer from the uptake of this technology and this new financial platform.”  GETTYCitibank India stopped its customers buying Bitcoin with debit or credit cards this week The 10 richest people in Cryptocurrency Wed, February 7, 2018Cryptocurrency: 10 of the wealthiest people in Cryptocurrency according to Forbes first ever Crypto rich list.

    Citing bitcoin advocate Andea M. Antonopoulos, who called on the Canadian Senate to hold off on market regulation in 2014, Mr Markey said: “He just put a lot of the concerns to rest."He was asked what regulation would you put on bitcoin and he said at the minute, none, because the technology needs room to breathe and evolve in the same way that in 1992 the internet came along and there was talk about it corrupting society and being used for all sorts of evil but we left it alone, we let it breathe, and look where we are now with it.“I think that’s exactly what should happen with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.“I think it’s going to play an important part in the future and if too many governments either ban it or regulate it very heavy handedly it could put the potential benefits of it at jeopardy.”Mr Markey says he want more education about cryptocurrencies to be shared with the greater public who he believes have a largely negative view about cryptocurrencies.Cryptocurrency markets were buoyed earlier today by White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Rob Joyce’s suggesting the US government is nowhere near to regulating bitcoin.
