Today, the cryptocurrency touched a low of $1.17.“The correction has broken below the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels, which suggests weakness.“The cryptocurrency is currently trading inside a descending channel. The downtrend will end when the bulls breakout and sustain above the channel.“Though the XRP/USD pair has plunged about 65 percent from its highs, we shall buy it only after it confirms a bottom formation.”8am: Sebastian Kettley takes over live reporting from Joe Tambini.

We do not think that the complete banning of cryptocurrencies is possible.”Charles Hayter, founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare, also said: “Seems like it’s uncertainty spooking the markets…with regulations unclear.“Traders are taking profits on the increased risk scenarios going forward.”At this rate of decline I will be wealthier than Ripple founder by Friday https://t.co/s67zhUGlVm— Blockchain Lindzon (@howardlindzon) January 16, 20181pm: Bright future ahead of bitcoin, pledges analystBitcoin prices could swell up to an astounding £100,000 per token said Kay Van-Petersen, an analyst at Saxo Bank.He said: "First off, you could argue we have had a proper correction in bitcoin, it has had a 50 percent pull back at one point, which is healthy. “But we have still not seen the full effect of the futures contracts.”10.40am: Uncertainties over Chinese crypto market triggered sell-off, claims expertIqbal Gandham, UK Managing Director at eToro, argued that the crypto market is reeling in the aftermath of China cracking down on bitcoin.He said: “The market is correcting off the back of news that China is moving to crack down on cryptocurrency trading. “Chinese investors are likely spooked having heard the news and the market is on edge as a result.“But we don’t expect to see a major sell-off.

Small peer-to-peer transactions aren’t being targeted."4.05pm: Kat Hopps takes over live reporting from Sebastian Kettley11.55am: ‘Don’t buy cryptocurrencies’ blast Mr Money MoustachePeter Adeney, a popular financial blogger also known as Mr Money Moustache, has urged potential investors to stay away from the allure of cryptocurrencies. The finance expert likened the crypto craze to the devastating 17th century Tulip Mania – the world’s first economic bubble crash.He said: “When you make this kind of purchase – which you should never do – you are speculating. This is not a useful activity. “You’re playing a psychological, win-lose battle against other humans with money as the sole objective. Even if you win money through dumb luck, you have lost time and energy, which means you have lost.“Investing means buying an asset that actually creates products, services or cashflow, such as a profitable business or a rentable piece of real estate, for an extended period of time. “An investment is something that has intrinsic value – that is, it would be worth owning from a financial perspective, even if you could never sell it.”  GETTYRipple price: South Korean officials have pledged to ban the speculative trade of cryptocurrencies10.30am: South Korean ban on crypto trading postponedKorean regulators sent shockwaves through the markets last week, after Justice Minister Park Sang-ki announced his decision to ban the trade of digital currencies.But an official from the Office for Government Policy Coordination has now revealed that the plans have not been finalised yet.He told a press conference: “The plan to ban cryptocurrency exchanges, recently mentioned by the nation’s justice minister, is one measure in talks to curb speculative investments, which the government will carry on with enough discussion for before finalising the decision.”On January 11, Mr Park threatened to put an end to the highly speculative trade of cryptocurrencies.Digital tokens like bitcoin and Ripple tend to trade with 30 percent premiums in South Korea.9.07am: Ripple volatility is a ‘mystery’ claims crypto expertTiffany Hayden, community manager of blockchain wallet Edge, said that she does not know why cryptocurrencies exhibit such high degrees of volatility.Replying to a questions about Ripple on social media, Ms Hayden said that short-term owning of XRP is a frustrating venture.She said: “I have no idea why crypto is so volatile. Bitcoin came so close to hitting $20K last month and now it’s under $14K. “Alts often follow suit. $XRP is more frustrating to own, short-term, IMO. It moves differently.

It offers comparatively high transactions per second, and negligible fees. “But for those who dream of a decentralisation future, Ripple is not the answer.”Unlike bitcoin, the entire 100 billion supply of Ripple tokens was pre-mined by its creators.
