   The IFO has criticised the German and French leadership’s handling of their meetings with President Trump after failing to represent Europe’s position “strongly, with one voice”.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron largely failed in their separate bids to persuade US President Donald Trump to grant EU nations exemptions from tariffs on steel and aluminium which could grind eurozone industry to a halt.The Eurozone now faces another anxious wait after the White extended a temporary reprieve from the tariffs for the EU, Canada and Mexico until June 1.Although President Trump has taken the lions’ share of blame for the escalation of trade tension, Ifo President Clemens Fuest says “the EU is not entirely innocent” in what has become the international trading community’s, "worst crisis in decades" following the “mismanaged” meetings.Mr Fuest said: "The EU should speak more strongly with one voice.“ He added the EU should avoid such a scenario where Mrs Merkel is appealing to the Mr Trump on behalf of Volkswagen and Siemens while Mr Macron champions further European integration.

     I ask for a total exemption because Europe is not an enemy of the USA.Antonio Tajani, President of the European ParliamentThe economics chief said that the EU should respond "moderately but firmly”, and the EU should proceed against the tariffs at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and respond with limited punitive tariffs, such as on motorcycles and jeans.He said: ”At the same time, they should offer the US to negotiate the mutual reducing of tariffs.”However, Mr Fuest does not really see any chance of a ‘TTIP light’(The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) relationship between the EU and EU in the near future, but admits, "it would still be worth a try because such an agreement would be very useful for both sides".Antonio Tajani President of the European Parliament has slammed Trump’s tariffs, claiming that “30 days is not enough” and "Trump must understand that we are friends, not enemies”.He said: "I ask for a total exemption because Europe is not an enemy of the USA."The Western World competes with China, especially for the production of steel. There is a Chinese overproduction and we must not allow the European and American markets to be invaded by Chinese overproduction.”Mr Tajani has "wished for this principle to be accepted by the United States and for President Trump to understand the difference between friends and those who have trade policies that go against the US”.   The European Commission, which coordinates trade policy for the 28 EU members, is also arguing for Mr Trump to drop his controversial trade tariffs against the EU, claiming that the bloc should be permanently exempted from the tariffs since it was not the cause of overcapacity in steel and aluminium.The Commission said earlier this week: “The US decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions.”Germany, whose trade surplus has attracted criticism from Trump, said it expected a permanent exemption.German economy minister Peter Altmaier said, has urged for more talks with Washington, said: “I am firmly convinced that in the interests of jobs in Germany, in Europe and in the USA, we need a long-term provision and that raising tariffs is the wrong way.”Additional reporting from Monika Pallenberg
