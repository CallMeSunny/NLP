  GETTYChina hit USA with 25 per cent levy on 106 productsSoybean prices dived this morning as China announced its measures, while US stock futures fell further with S&P 500 Index contracts now down almost 0.7per cent.China confirmed it would levy 25 percent tariffs on imports of 106 US products including soybeans, automobiles, chemicals and aircraft, in response to proposed American duties on its high-tech goods.The Ministry of Commerce in Beijing said the charges will apply to around £36billion of US imports, matching the value of the goods targeted by Mr Trump's new measures. In a statement released Wednesday, China’s envoy to the World Trade Organisation, Zhang Xiangchen, said a list of planned charges on more than 1,300 product categories focused on its industrial machinery and technology exports was "an intentional and gross violation of the WTO’s fundamental principles of non-discrimination and bound tariffs".

China and Russia strengthen ties against Western countries     The tariffs may have only a minor economic impact, increasing levies by $12.5 billion on Chinese shipments to the U.S. that reached $506 billion last year, amounting to an average tariff increase on overall imports from China of just 2.5 percent, , said Shane Oliver, the head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd in Sydney. The China director of the U.S. Soybean Export Council said China's decision to impose tariffs on imports of soybeans from the United States is 'regrettable' and 'won't solve the trade imbalance'.U.S. soybean futures fell more than 5 percent following the announcement. A Beijing-based soybean trader said there are growing concerns about the cancellation of previously purchased cargoes by the world's top buyer of the oilseed.Soybeans, the top U.S. agricultural export to China, were among the 106 U.S. products on which Beijing plans to impose an additional 25 percent in tariffs.The U.S. is the second-biggest soybean supplier, after Brazil, to China, the world's largest consumer of the bean.The move had been expected by the U.S. soybean industry, China Director Zhang Xiaoping told Reuters, despite the Council, which represents American soybean producers, having done "everything" to prevent it.China may still buy U.S. soybeans, despite the additional tariff, if the market needs supplies, said Zhang.He added: "The main risk is that China’s response leads to a counter retaliation by the U.S. and a process of escalating tariffs that leads to a sharp slowing in trade between the two countries."Speaking on CNBC, ambassador Cui Tiankai confirmed his country would respond “very soon”.He added: "We will certainly respond accordingly. We will resort to the WTO — World Trade Organization — dispute settlement mechanism, and we’ll, in accordance with Chinese laws, take measures to fight back.

    “It will not protect American workers or American farmers. It will not protect American businesses or American consumers. It will hurt everybody including the U.S. economy itself."He stressed that the two economic were “so closely interconnected" that "any unilateral measures will hurt the other side, but the end result would be that it would hurt itself”.He added: "We have done the utmost to avoid this kind of situation, but if the other side makes the wrong choice, then we have no alternative but to fight back.“In today's global economy, almost everything is interconnected. So when people take some wrong measures, when people take some protectionist measure, it will hurt people's confidence in the overall prospects for the economy. It may hurt finance, it may hurt trade, it may hurt economic performance, it may hurt consumer confidence — everything.”We are always ready to continue and intensify our dialogue and communication with the U.S. side on any possible economic or trade issues, but we need reciprocity. Our goodwill has to be met by the same degree of goodwill."
