  GETTYJurgen Klopp has seen improvements since arriving in October 2015Inspiration takes the form of a quote from Bob Paisley which newly adorns one of the changing room walls.“When you count second place as failure then standards are becoming fantastically high. We never celebrate second place here,” read the words of wisdom espoused by Liverpool’s most successful ever manager.There have been other changes during a summer facelift to what Klopp regards as his football HQ while a decision is taken on whether to move to a new purpose-built facility, merge with the academy at nearby Kirkby or invest in a total upgrade.In the players’ dressing room there is a silhouette on the wall of the aftermath of the exhilarating Europa League victory over Borussia Dortmund when Liverpool’s heroes linked arms in a line and celebrated in front of The Kop.A communal area has also been created for the squad to chill out in between, and after, double sessions and foster the spirit required to underpin their efforts.

    To that end, breakfast is compulsory. Outside, a paddle tennis court is in the process of being completed. When Klopp took his squad to Tenerife for a training break last March during international week, he fell in love in the game and requested one be built at Melwood.Some might see it as an indulgence, but it will also double as a head tennis court for the players while offering Klopp somewhere to wind down after long hours and immerse himself in battles with his coaching staff Jon Achterberg, Pep Lijnders and Peter Krawietz. It is therefore a physical and mental stimulant.If changes off the pitch have been plentiful, then the looming trip to Tottenham can act as a neat barometer of progress on the pitch.A lunchtime kick-off on a Saturday at White Hart Lane represents the where and when of Klopp’s formal introduction to the Premier League last October when he offered a first glimpse of his brand of heavy metal football in the match that ended 0-0. In the main, it has been music to supporters’ ears only for a bum note, seemingly out of nowhere, to check momentum and fling Liverpool backwards. Klopp has made strides.

We are still on the way,” said Klopp, acknowledging the need for greater consistency. “The last defeat feels always stronger than the last win.“The players developed in the last few months. You get more experience. It doesn’t mean we are 200pc better. It is just that we feel stronger together and that is a big point.”   var related_quizzes=[{"title":"How Well Do You Know Arsenal FC?","asset":"https://cdn-arkquizzstoragelive.akamaized.net/cdn/18d954c0-0eb6-4124-84bf-af99bcefa2d7_Arsenal_logo-2[1].jpg","redirect":"http://games.express.co.uk/quiz/?game=trivia_fc-arsenal-quiz"},{"title":"How Well Do You Know Manchester United?","asset":"https://az831976.vo.msecnd.net/cdn/manchester-united-quiz_manchester_united_wallpapers_02[1].jpg?key=1f495f26-2efd-46d2-927c-9a01c1b8b9e8","redirect":"http://games.express.co.uk/quiz/?game=trivia_manchester-united-quiz"},{"title":"How Well Do You Know Chelsea FC?","asset":"https://cdn-arkquizzstoragelive.akamaized.net/cdn/c2d1565b-73d3-4835-bc95-e056a48a69d5_Chelsea_Logo_02[1].jpg","redirect":"http://games.express.co.uk/quiz/?game=trivia_chelsea-fc-quiz"}];window.addEventListener("load",function(){window.ark_quiz.related(related_quizzes)})Ahead of the return to Tottenham, Klopp has been in charge of 32 Premier League games for Liverpool, winning 14, drawing 9 and losing 9. The results from predecessor Brendan Rodgers’ last 32 games are: W15 D9 L8.There were two Cup Finals as well, albeit losing ones, but while there have been plenty of changes to the squad questions remain as to whether there is the quality to penetrate the league’s upper-reaches.Have Liverpool strengthened enough?Not at left-back, probably not in midfield and we are waiting to find out if they have at goalkeeper following the pre-season injury to Loris Karius.Yet there should be no real surprise Liverpool remain work in progress.Here was a manager seeking to implement a vision and a style of play.  GETTYAlberto Moreno's performance's have been scrutinised of lateNine months does not feel long enough to implement an overhaul, although the work being overseen in Manchester by messrs Mourinho and Guardiola may yet expose that.Liverpool do not have the deep pockets of their rivals but Klopp prefers to do things differently in any case.There were obvious benefits in signing that new six year contract in July, but if he did not believe in the mission he had signed up for.The hope for Liverpool must be that Klopp’s glass-half-full optimism is not misplaced.That his belief that time spent at Melwood, where new fitness coach Andreas Kornmayer and nutritionist Mona Nemmer are already key figures, can smooth away glitches proves correct. That nurture wins the battle over nature.“We have to build on our experience this season and create the future with this team,” said Klopp.
