   The Beijing chief insisted that globalisation is not to blame for the "chaos" currently engulfing the world and railed against countries which "pursue their own interests at the expense of others". In a swipe at the Brexit referendum and the election of Mr Trump, which were both fuelled by a voter backlash against fatcat greed and growing inequality, he said the global economy is an "ocean" from which no country can escape. And he insisted that "no one will emerge as a winner" from any trade war - a thinly veiled reference to Mr Trump's comments about slapping extra taxes on Chinese exports and British chancellor Philip Hammond's threat to Germany over post-Brexit tariffs.

Any attempt to cut off flows of capital, technologies, products, industries and people between economies and channel the waters in the ocean back into isolated lakes and creeks, this is simply not possible and indeed it runs counter to the historical trend."We must remain committed to developing free trade and investment, to promoting trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation through opening up, and we must say no to protectionism."Pursuing protectionism is just like locking oneself in a dark room. While wind and rain may be kept outside so are light and air."   GETTYChinese President Xi Jinping will defend globalisation in the face of mounting public hostility  IGThe Chinese premier took a pointed swipe at Brexit and Donald Trump  IGPresident Xinping said globalisation was not to blame for the world's problemsThe audience then burst into applause as he railed: "No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war." President Xi also pointedly added: "Today mankind has become a close-knit community with a shared future. All countries enjoy the right to development, yet at the same time they should view their own interests in the broader context and refrain from pursuing their own interests at the expense of others." President Xi's 50-minute long speech was the first address given at Davos by a Chinese leader, and marks the country's continually growing presence on the world stage. He used it to insist that China is open to business to the whole world and said that his country was "not jealous of others' success" or of those who had benefitted from globalisation. And in another barely disguised reference to Mr Trump he insisted that Beijing will "keep its door wide open, and not close it" and said he hoped other major economies would do the same. Whilst once again alluding to the Republican's protectionist policies, he added: "We should adhere to multilateralism to uphold the authority and efficacy of multilateral institutions. We should honour promises and abide by rules. One should not select or bend rules as he sees fit."    GETTYPresident Xi's presence was a sign of the shift from a uni-polar world dominated by the US  REUTERSHe is the first Chinese premier to address the exclusive forum in Switzerland No one will emerge as a winner in a trade warChinese president Xi JinpingIan Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, a US-based political risk consultancy, said that global events including Brexit and the election of Mr Trump prompted his appearance at Davos, with China prepared to take on an increasingly leading role on the world stage. He added: "It is no coincidence that Xi chose this year to make the trip up the magic mountain." More than half a dozen senior Chinese government figures will be in Davos this week, far more than in past years. And a large number of sessions are focused on Asia, including one entitled "Asia Takes the Lead". WEF founder Klaus Schwab said President Xi's presence was a sign of the shift from a uni-polar world dominated by the United States to a more multi-polar system in which rising powers like China will have to step up and play a bigger role. His appearance, a first for a Chinese leader at the annual meeting of political leaders, CEOs and bankers in Davos, comes as the part the United States plays as a force for multilateral cooperation on issues like trade and climate change is in doubt following the election of Donald Trump. Europe, meanwhile, is pre-occupied with its own troubles, from Brexit and militant attacks to the string of elections this year in which anti-globalisation populists could score gains. This has left a vacuum that China seems eager to fill. "We can hope that China in this new world will assume a responsive and responsible leadership role," Mr Schwab said. "So in some ways it is very symbolic to have the president of China here."  World Economic Forum meeting in Davos Thu, January 22, 2015World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos Jan. 21-24.

    President Xi's appearance comes amid rising tensions between Beijing and President-elect Trump, who will be inaugurated on Friday, the final day of the Davos meeting. President-elect Trump campaigned on a promise to confront China more aggressively on trade and broke with decades of precedent last month by taking a congratulatory telephone call from the president of Taiwan, which Beijing sees as part of China. He has not toned down his rhetoric since, saying only last week that America's "One China" policy was up for negotiation, triggering a furious response from state-run Chinese newspapers. "If Trump is determined to use this gambit in taking office, a period of fierce, damaging interactions will be unavoidable, as Beijing will have no choice but to take off the gloves," the English-language China Daily said. President Xi is not expected to wade into the tit-for-tat with President-elect Trump in Davos. Speaking in the Swiss capital Bern on the eve of his speech, he stressed the importance of cooperation.    "Protectionism, populism and de-globalisation are on the rise. It's not good for closer economic cooperation globally," Xi said. China, the world's top exporter, is heavily dependent on free trade and could be hit hard by a new wave of protectionism. Fears of a hard economic landing in China roiled global markets during last year's Davos. And while those concerns have eased, the International Monetary Fund warned on Monday of ongoing risks to the economy, including its high reliance on government spending, record lending by state banks and an overheating property market. "China is still one of the biggest risks, and I think the only reason it is not at the top of the list is that the United States has become such a locus of uncertainty," Kenneth Rogoff, an economist at Harvard University, said.
