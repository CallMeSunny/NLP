   Mr Johnson, speaking during a visit to UK manufacturing giant JCB's Staffordshire headquarters, said: "I don't think we've gone in with sufficient drive and gumption to get this." Meanwhile Ms Jenkyns urged her colleagues in Westminster to “get on with delivering Brexit” and stop “pushing democracy into the long grass”.

The Government can take a lead and rule out ‘no deal’ now, in the process ending the grotesque waste of £4.2 billion on ‘no deal’ planning.”“It is also not encouraging that, as well as refusing to take ‘no deal’ off the table, No. 10 spokespeople and Cabinet members have so far ruled out any movement on a new customs union with the EU, which would be necessary for a new deal to win support in parliament.“Whatever one thinks of those issues, that reinforces the view these are not genuine talks, but designed to play for time and give the appearance of reaching out, whilst sticking rigidly to your own emphatically rejected deal.“Meaningful dialogue or negotiations require acknowledgement that your government’s deal has been decisively rejected, and the government must now be open to other options that can win support in Parliament. And the starting point must be a commitment to rule out ‘no deal’.”  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has written to Prime Minister Theresa May (Image: GETTY)9.07pm update: McVeigh reveals PM's efforts to persuade ministers to back Brexit divorce planBrexiteer Esther McVey has revealed the tactics employed by Prime Minister Theresa May to try to get support for her Brexit agreement from the Cabinet.Former Work and Pensions Secretary Ms McVey, who resigned over Theresa May’s Brexit agreement, explained tactics used by the Prime Minister to drum up Cabinet support for her exit agreement.Speaking at a Leave Means Leave rally in London, the Conservative MP claimed lengthy documents were given to frontbenchers “a couple of days before” or even a “day before” discussions were set to begin.Ms McVey, who was reportedly moments away from being removed from Downing Street by security after a stormy Cabinet meeting at which Mrs May unveiled her Brexit withdrawal agreement, discussed events at Chequers where Ministers had their phones taken away before they spoke about the Prime Minister’s Brexit plan.Former Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson resigned hours later.Ms McVeigh told the rally: “What we did not know, as we sat and had dinner, yes we did, our mobile phones were taken. We didn’t realise there was a press release going out.“Didn’t realise there was meant to be unanimous consent for what went on, because there wasn’t.”For full story click here7.42pm update China bids to woo German banks as they prepare for "post-Brexit world"China is attempting to woo German banks to open up in Beijing as the two countries commit to strengthening each other’s financial sectors in the post-Brexit world.The bilateral pledge came as a result of German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz visiting the Chinese capital this week.Mr Scholz met China’s vice-premier Liu He who promised to take down economic hurdles for German financial institutions interested in doing business in his country.The German minister said he would reciprocate, hoping Chinese banks could be persuaded to open in Frankfurt, the heart of Germany’s finance industry, turning the city into a European powerhouse after Britain leaves the EU.For full story, click here7.25pm update: “Delaying Article 50 will achieve nothing,” insists Brexiteer MP JenkynsArch-Brexiteer and Tory MP Angela Jenkyns has said delaying Article 50 will achieve nothing.And she urged her colleagues in Westminster to “get on with delivering Brexit” and stop “pushing democracy into the long grass”.Ms Jenkyns, MP for Morley and Outwood, a backer of the Leave Means Leave campaign group, made her views plain in a blog written for www.westmonster.com.She wrote: “Some MPs are now advocating that we delay Brexit by extending Article 50 as if this will somehow make resolve the deadlock in Parliament.“However, nothing is going to change.

Our side is ready. It's largely dependent on other whether countries believe that there will be no deal and are willing to put the work in to the preparations."6.14pm update: People's Vote "would take more a year to organise"A second referendum would take more than a year to organise – dealing a huge blow to Remainers campaigning for a so-called ‘people’s vote’ on the UK’s exit from the European Union.Support for a second referendum on Britain’s membership with the bloc has gathered momentum following Theresa May’s catastrophic defeat on her Brexit deal in the House of Commons on January 15.The Prime Minister’s withdrawal agreement with Brussels was resoundingly defeated by 230 votes in parliament - the biggest ever defeat for a sitting government.However, the document, shared with parliamentarians outlining the timeframe required, shows a second vote could take up to 14 months to come to fruition, from the passage of primary legislation right through until the 10-week campaign.For full story, click here6.05pm update: Theresa May holding crunch talks with JunckerTheresa May is holding urgent talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker this afternoon as her Brexit crisis deepens.Mrs May is facing a Brexit deadlock after MPs overwhelmingly rejected her withdrawal agreement in a crunch vote on Tuesday. The Prime Minister called on the Commons to come together for cross-party talks to find a way forward following the humiliating defeat.And now Mrs May has turned to Mr Juncker as she prepares to present a Plan B to ministers on Monday.A spokesman for the European Commission said: "At her request, president Juncker will talk to Prime Minister May today, early afternoon."Mrs May is also meeting "a large number" of Cabinet ministers at 10 Downing Street today, with more than half of the Prime Minister’s top team attending.For full story click here  Theresa May is holding talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker (Image: GETTY)5.49pm: British financiers face being BARRED from moving to New York in no deal situation, warn companiesBritish financiers are facing the prospect of being BARRED from relocating to New York in the event of a no-deal Brexit, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) have both warned.The portfolio managers would eventually be transferred to mainland Europe to handle client accounts there once Britain and the European Union agreed a regulatory framework, they added.But neither of the firms, which together employ more than 10,000 people in London, expects a chaotic exit that would force them to carry out the emergency relocation, the sources said.A spokeswoman for BlackRock, which is the world's biggest asset manager and manages around $6.3 trillion, declined to comment on the plan but in an emailed response to Reuters said: "BlackRock maintains extensive regulatory licenses and permissions across Europe and globally to ensure it can continue to serve its clients post-Brexit."To avert such moves, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is in talks with Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on agreements which would oversee cross-border asset activity and managers.5.38pm update: Germany hires 900 extra customs officers prior to BrexitGermany's customs agency is hiring 900 extra officers in preparation for Britain's departure from the European Union, its director told the news magazine Der Spiegel, warning companies that, deal or no deal, they needed better to prepare for Brexit.In an interview, extracts from which were published on Friday, customs agency head Colette Hercher said the agency was well prepared regardless of whether Britain's exit was regulated by an agreement deal or happens with no agreement.Ms Percher said: ”In particular those firms which until now have only done business in the EU will have to get ready."We will do what we have always done for non-EU countries, but for one country more."The extra officers would mainly be deployed in ports and airports, she said.5.33pm update: Remain "activists" raise £30,000 for billboard campaignPro-Remain activists aiming to highlight the "hypocrisy" of British politicians on Brexit have raised more than £30,000 in one day to erect billboards featuring their quotes across the country.The campaigners, calling themselves Led By Donkeys, said the public donations are due to "an incredible sense of frustration" about the promises some MPs made and "the reality people are observing with their own eyes".A spokesman for the group said: "It's like watching a bank heist and seeing the getaway car screech away and nobody chasing them."So that's what we're doing, we're chasing them down with a ladder, a roller and their own words."  Dutch PM Mark Rutte (Image: GETTY)5.10pm update: Dutch PM fears impact of Brexit on Netherlands as he says: "Time is running out"Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has said any form of Brexit, with or without a deal, will damage the Netherlands, a major British trading partner and one of the world's top five export countries.Mr Rutte, , who earlier said he “didn’t see how” the Brexit deal agreed by the EU in Christmas “could be tweaked”, admitted: ”It will cause disruptions and we are trying to minimise those. We need to look at the facts and prepare for all scenarios. Hope for the best and prepare for the worst."Among measures taken by the Dutch government is the hiring of roughly 1,000 customs officials to deal with changes in border checks."I appeal to social organisations, companies and institutions, if they have not done so already, to inform themselves about what must be done to be prepared. Time is running out. March 29 is only 10 weeks away."5.05pm: "The responsibility is in London"While many EU officials have suggested any such approval would come only with strings attached, Mr Asselborn was very specific about what it would take.He said ”Only the initiative to hold a second referendum could be an indication to extend Article 50. Maybe it is a bit daring to say so. But it seems obvious that something strong needs to be behind the idea to tinker with Article 50.Luxembourg's Prime Minister Prime Minister Xavier Bettel added: "The ball is in London. They have to tell us what they want.“We are currently in a situation where we still don't know which direction things are moving in, if there will be an agreement or not. The responsibility is in London.”5.03pm update: 'No referendum, no extension of Article 50,' vows Luxembourg's foreign ministerOnly an agreement by Britain to hold a second referendum can delay Article 50's impelementation on March 29, Luxembourg's veteran foreign minister Jean Asselborn has said.A dedicated European Union federalist known for speaking his mind, Mr Asselborn made his comments while outlining with Prime Minister Xavier Bettel their country's preparations for the most damaging no-deal  scenario.Since Prime Minister Theresa May's divorce deal negotiated with the EU was voted down on Tuesday, there are growing expectations about the possibility of Britain seeking a delay to the original  date to prepare for the new reality.Extending Article 50 would require unanimity among the other 27 EU member countries.  Remainer Nick Boles, pictured in the Commons, told Radio 4 he had received death threats (Image: Parliament TV)6.52pm: Ministers prepared to defy PM to veto no-deal Brexit, says Remainer MP Boles, as he reveals death threatsMinisters in Theresa May's Government are ready to defy her and to vote for a backbench plan to give MPs power to block a no-deal, a Tory MP has warned.Nick Boles, MP for Grantham and Stamford, told the BBC some non-Cabinet ministers had told him directly they would quit if whipped against a bill allowing parliamentarians to demand Article 50 be extended for fresh talks with Brussels.Speaking to the Radio 4 podcast Political Thinking Mr Boles also said members of his local Tory party in Lincolnshire may try to deselect him because of his stance on and said he continued to receive death threats.Mr Boles' dropped a planned bill giving more power to the backbenches on Wednesday but has swung behind the cross-party replacement European Union Withdrawal (Number 3) Bill, which is due to be tabled by Labour's Yvette Cooper on Monday.4.34pm update: "EU cannot refuse to extend Article 50 if UK asks for one," says ex-commissionerThe European Union cannot refuse an extension of Article 50 should the UK request one to the EU27 as it will be the only way to avoid the "major crash" of a no deal scenario, claimed former Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht.The former European Commissioner told BBC Radio 4 Today Programme the EU would have little choice regarding an extension of Article 50 if the UK requested to delay the Brexit process.Mr De Gucht claimed the EU27 could not refuse such request but could approve it on the basis of a number of pre-conditions.He said: “If there is no agreement or a majority on whatever in the House of Commons I’m pretty sure that at a certain moment in time Britain is going to ask for an extension of Article 50.”For full story, click here4.24pm update: "Irish PM Varadkar has turned backstop into "impossible" issue," claims LamontLord Lamont also hit out at Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar for making the Irish backstop “impossible” to be amended and halting the Brexit progress.He insisted it was “obvious” DUP MPs would vote for the deal if there is a time limit or unilateral way out of the backstop.But he warned the Irish leader is the one responsible for preventing a deal which is agreeable among MPs.The former Tory chancellor said: “Now, why is this so impossible? It’s so impossible because Mr Varadkar has chosen to make it that. It is not the EU itself. It is Mr Varadkar.For full story, click here   4.20pm update: "Britain can squeeze a better Brexit deal out of Brussels," says former Chancellor Lord LamontFormer Chancellor Norman Lamont said it is still possible to “squeeze” a better Brexit deal out of the European Union before warning the Irish Prime Minister is behind the Brexit deadlock.Speaking on Sky News, Lord Lamont said: “I think it is a matter of possibly squeezing something out of Brussels."You know, everybody just says ‘oh no, Brussels won’t consider anything else. The 27 are solid’.“It’s all very well to say the EU have said they won’t do this. But, you know, there is an onus on both sides in a negotiation.”4.12pm: EU deal "cannot be tweaked," says Dutch PM RutteDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said on Friday he told his British counterpart Theresa May he did not see how the current deal on Britain's exit from the European Union can be "tweaked".Rutte said he had conveyed that message to May in a phone call on Thursday, after the deal was rejected by the British parliament.He explained: ”I said: 'I don't see how the current deal can be tweaked’."She is really expecting Brexit to go ahead on March 29."4.06pm update: "We should all be getting on with Brexit"Asked if he would back Theresa May as Tory leader if she decided to call a snap general election, Mr Johnson said: "I think most people in this country feel they've had quite enough of elections – I certainly do."What they voted for was to leave the EU and to take advantage of the opportunity of Brexit."That's what we should all be getting on with."Asked, if an election was called, Mrs May should stand down, he replied: "I think it is highly unlikely that a snap election would be the outcome."When Mr Johnson was asked why he had delivered a speech rather than discuss his ideas with Mrs May, he said: "I've told the Prime Minister myself very many times, and thought perhaps it was a good idea to try and tell as many people as possible as so far I've not been successful in persuading her."   4.04pm update: "Of course I voted for her"Asked if he was "making a naked leadership pitch" and "undermining" the Prime Minister, Mr Johnson said it was "terrific" that Theresa May had won the confidence vote – adding "I voted for her, of course".He added: "But she has not succeeded, emphatically not succeeded, in getting her deal in Parliament."It's gone down by a majority of 230, and that's unprecedented."It cannot come back, it is an ex-deal."What is needed now, and that's what I am trying to do, is humbly and sincerely offer a way forward."4pm update: May "lacks gumption", says JohnsonFormer Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson sidestepped questions about whether he had ambitions to replace Theresa May as Prime Minister, as he warned she and her Government “lacked gumption”Mr Johnson, speaking during a visit to UK manufacturing giant JCB's Staffordshire headquarters at which he made a speech focusing on Brexit, was quizzed by reporters about why he had resigned his Cabinet role last summer, said: "Actually this is the moment and I don't think we've gone in with sufficient drive and gumption to get this."I tried for about a year. I tried very, very hard to get the right vision of leaving the EU."He added: "The route the Government chose, the route the Prime Minister chose, which was to say let's stay in the customs union, let's stay locked in to the single market, let's have a situation in which the UK is basically governed by the EU even though we're outside the EU – that approach has been rejected by Parliament."3.48pm "Tremendous uncertainty"Borrowing one of Mr Trump's favourite words, Mr Winfree said: "There is a tremendous amount of political uncertainty out there."Such lack of clarity, he added, was a large reason for the reluctance of businesses to invest.He said: "They are just sitting on their money."Whenever that is settled and the political stuff gets worked out we will ultimately see investment go up."3.45pm "Businesses will bounce back after Brexit uncertainty is resolved," says ex-Trump advisorBusiness investment in the UK is poised to bounce back once uncertainty over Brexit has been resolved a former senior economic advisor to US President Donald Trump has said.Paul Winfree, an economist at the Heritage Foundation and former director of budget policy for the Trump administration, said the financial reserves are "a lot higher" than they have been historically.He said: "So it would seem to me that when the political winds stop moving from here to there and there is some certainty in what is going on in the UK, some of that will be freed up and you will see investment start again and the pound come up."The banks are sitting on assets and that is in part a derivative of Brexit."3.42pm update: Corbyn's refusal "deeply disappointing"Mr Williamson said of Mr Corbyn's refusal: "This is deeply disappointing."The Prime Minister reached out across the House of Commons, giving the Labour leader the option to talk and discuss how best to take things forward, and he's just turned round and refused to do this, despite the fact that so often he's talked to so many other organisations and groups."The 42-year-old, who last year said Russia should "go away and shut up" in the wake of the Novichok attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and daughter Yulia in Salisbury – added: "I very much hope that he will rethink his position and take a more mature and considered attitude."It's always been clear that Britain can survive and it will thrive and it will prosper whether there is a deal or whether there is no deal, and it is absolutely right to ensure that no-deal is on the table."We have a fantastic opportunity, an amazing deal that the Prime Minister has negotiated with the European Union, and that's the deal that Labour and all parties should be getting behind and backing."  Gavin Williamson has called on Mr Corbyn to be "more mature" (Image: EPA)3.31pm update: "Grow up," Defence Secretary Williamson tells CorbynLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn must "mature" and accept the Prime Minister's offer to sit down for Brexit talks, Gavin Williamson has said.The Defence Secretary – who has previously said the army has 3,500 troops ready in the event of a no-deal situation – called for Labour to get behind Theresa May's "amazing deal", despite MPs having rejected it by a majority of 230 votes on Tuesday, and repeated his assertion that Britain would "thrive and prosper" in the event of a no deal.Mr Williamson spoke at MOD St Athan in the Vale of Glamorgan during a visit to discuss the future of the South Wales base with representatives from the Welsh-based RAF and Army.He called on the Labour leader to meet with the PM before she publishes her new Brexit plan in Parliament on January 21.   3.23pm update: Tusk "has discussed Brexit with PM Theresa May"Donald Tusk has confirmed he has discussed the Brexit situation with Prime Minister Theresa May.Tne European Council Preisdent tweeted: "Discussed with PM @theresa_may the next steps on the UK side. #Brexit"His message comes days after another message on the social media platform on January 15, shortly after Mrs May's Brexit plan was crushed in the House of Commons, in which he appeared to suggest Britain should stay in the EU.He posted: "If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?"3.08pm Letter still posted on Vote Leave websiteThe letter – which mentions Turkey 15 times – is still posted on the Vote Leave website.In April that year, Mr Johnson – who himself has Turkish ancestry – told the Express last year: "I am very pro-Turkish but what I certainly can't imagine is a situation in which 77 million of my fellow Turks and those of Turkish origin can come here without any checks at all. That is mad – that won't work."However a month earlier, he had acknowledged, in an interview with LBC radio that "the chances of the Turks readily acceding to the European Union are between nil and 20 percent – probably lower than that".Vote Leave produced adverts posted widely on social media during the campaign which stated that "Turkey (population 76 million) is joining the EU" and "Britain's new border is with Syria and Iraq".  Boris Johnson was put on the spot on the subject of Turkey (Image: GETTY)3.03pm Boris Johnson put on the spot over Turkey EU claimsBoris Johnson has come under fire after claiming that he did not issue warnings over immigration from Turkey during the 2016 EU referendum.The former foreign secretary was put on the spot by Channel 4 journalist Michael Crick while answering questions after a speech on Brexit in Staffordshire.The figurehead of Vote Leave was asked whether he disowned claims made by the campaign that Turkey was about to join the EU and suggestions that this might lead to large-scale immigration to the UK.He responded: "I didn't say anything about Turkey in the referendum. Since I made no remarks, I can't disown them."However, Mr Johnson was a signatory to an open letter to then-prime minister David Cameron a week before the referendum vote in June 2016 stating that it was EU policy that Turkey should join, and demanding to know if Britain will veto its accession and block plans for visa-free travel for its citizens."If the Government cannot give this guarantee, the public will draw the reasonable conclusion that the only way to avoid having common borders with Turkey is to Vote Leave and take back control on 23 June," said the letter, signed by Mr Johnson and fellow-Brexiters Michael Gove and Gisela Stuart.2.40pm update: Youth group sends People’s Vote message to CorbynJeremy Corbyn has been targeted in his own back yard by a campaign urging him to back a second referendum and avoid "colluding" with Theresa May.Youth group Our Future Our Choice (OFOC), led by Labour and Momentum member Cathleen Clarke, have paid for a wraparound advert on one of Mr Corbyn's local papers in north London.The cover of Friday's Islington Tribune features the faces of 130 young supporters, activists and members of the Labour Party calling for a public vote on Brexit.In an open letter to Mr Corbyn on the inside of the cover, they warn the Labour leader he cannot get the general election he wants.This, it says, leaves a choice: "Either collude with the Tories to pass a second-rate deal that saves Theresa May's premiership, or we can support a public vote on Brexit."2.09pm update: Rees-Mogg to host weekly radio showTory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has been given his own weekly radio show in the run-up to Brexit.Mr Rees-Mogg will host an hour-long programme on LBC, the first at 6pm today, with the radio station saying it would be "packed with callers, opinion and debate".Mr Rees-Mogg said: "With Brexit at the top of the agenda and opinions running high, I look forward to finding out what the public really thinks over the next couple of months and to continuing the national debate on LBC."The chairman of the European Research Group (ERG) of Eurosceptic Conservatives has previously been a regular guest at LBC, taking part in a fortnightly half-hour phone-in during Nick Ferrari's breakfast show.London Mayor Sadiq Khan and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson have regular phone-in slots on the radio station, while former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has an evening slot from Monday to Thursday.LBC's managing editor James Rea said: "With the country in a state of political confusion, Jacob Rees-Mogg joins the LBC line-up during an extraordinary period."  Jacob Rees-Mogg settles into his studio at LBC (Image: PA)1.32pm update: Italy breaks ranks to criticise EUItaly deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini has hit out at Brussels and demanded EU leaders reduce Brexit demands.He said: ”What will Britain do? I think they will go to further negotiations with Brussels and I hope that no one in Brussels gets stubborn."The people are sovereign, evidently the British do not consider the guarantees contained in the agreement between the British government and the EU to be sufficient".The move represents a huge criticism from a European leader against the bloc - effectively breaking ranks within Brussels.1.20pm update: DUP rejects customs union claimsDUP leader Arlene Foster has dismissed reports claiming her party would be open to a post-Brexit customs union with EU.Mrs Foster issued a statement which said: “The report published in the Times this morning about the DUP is inaccurate and no doubt designed to undermine efforts to get the necessary changes to the withdrawal agreement.“The Prime Minister is very clear on our position. We have been consistent that for us it is the backstop which needs to be dealt with.“For the future we want an agreement which returns control of our money, our laws and our borders through a UK wide free trade arrangement with the EU.“The story in the Times is an attempt to cause division. Such tactics are not new to us and as in the past will not succeed.”  Jean-Claude Juncker will speak to Theresa May this afternoon (Image: EPA)1.11pm update: Theresa May to hold fresh talks with Jean-Claude JunckerTheresa May will be holding more talks with with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker todau.A spokesman for the European Commission said: "At her request, president Juncker will talk to Prime Minister May today, early afternoon."1.09pm update: Lib Dems accuse Johnson of “peddling mistruths”Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: "No-one will take lessons from Boris Johnson on eroding trust in our democracy.“The fact he is still peddling mistruths about money from Brexit going to our NHS is shameful. Brexit will make us poorer."As exit day approaches, with Theresa May's deal soundly defeated, extending Article 50 is the only responsible course of action left."We can then hold a people's vote with the option to remain in the EU. This could happen much sooner than has been suggested and dig the country out of the huge hole the Tories have excavated."12.58pm update: Fox says customs union membership “is not Brexit”International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has insisted staying in a permanent customs arrangement with the EU would "not be delivering Brexit".Mr Fox, who backed Leave during the 2016 referendum campaign, said the UK could not have an independent trade policy if it stayed in a customs union tied to Brussels.And he said voters expected the Government to honour its commitment to leave the customs union and single market, as set out in last year's Conservative Party manifesto.He said by staying in a customs union, the UK would "have to apply European trade law without having a say in how it's made" and apply a common external tariff, which would "restrict our ability to make agreements outside the European Union's ability to do so".Mr Fox also backed Mrs May's conclusion the Government could not rule out a no-deal Brexit.  International Trade Secretary Liam Fox (Image: PA)12.13pm update: Labour MP pours scorn on ‘helpful clown’ JohnsonLabour MP Virendra Sharma, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum, has ridiculed Boris Johnson’s Brexit speech.The Ealing Southall MP said: "Boris puts the moron in oxymoron.“He's now trying to act the great liberal by championing migration after shamelessly pushing anti-Turkish messages as a leader of the Vote Leave campaign."But the Government must love it when he gets up and gives these speeches.

The figure is up from 45 in October.Pharmacists said they were struggling to obtain some common medicines and are paying higher prices as a result.While some experts said uncertainty over Brexit was making the situation worse, others said this was not the case.Other reasons for the shortage may include increased global demand, cost of raw materials, new regulatory requirements driving up costs and fluctuations in exchange rates.Another explanation is that the NHS has driven down the prices it will pay for drugs, which makes the UK less attractive to manufacturers.Gareth Jones, from the National Pharmacy Association, told the BBC: "Uncertainty over Brexit appears to be a significant factor."Martin Sawer, executive director of the Healthcare Distribution Association, said people might be stockpiling medicines.He said: ”Some businesses could be speculating on Brexit.

It has welcomed Germany back as a sovereign nation and a European power."This we, as Germans, have not forgotten and we are grateful."
