GETTYSpahn is a rising star in GermanyThe party dealt the German leader a humilating defeat as they came ahead of her during regional elections in Mrs Merkel's own home state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.In the aftermath of the drubbing the Chancellor admitted she had regrets about how she had approached the migrant crisis in 2015.Mr Spahn said: “For me what is decisive is that the who come here, understand, above all, that the values of the western world, this freedom, these basic principles are different from those in    Afghanistan, Syria, China or Bangladesh and that our society is therefore different.”Mr Spahn has been hailed within the CDU as “the most talented politician of his generation” and is viewed as a possible future chancellor. He also said Muslim men should not be allowed to force their wives to wear the burka.Mr Spahn said: “Nobody has forced them to live here”.
