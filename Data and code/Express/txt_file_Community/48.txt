  GETTYMichael Sheen first foray into UK politics came when he fronted a BBC Wales documentary in JuneSo voluminous was the amount of smoke and steam that billowed out from its chimneys and stacks that, as a youngster, he thought it made the clouds. At night he took comfort from the fires of its furnaces and the lights in its buildings that could be seen for miles around. As Sheen grew older he kicked a ball around in the shadow of the plant and was such a good footballer by the age of 12 that a local scout engineered an offer for him to join the Arsenal youth team. But there was no way his parents were going to decamp to London. The plant was their life too.  Related articles   Day and Night: Michael Sheen debunks reports he is quitting Hollywood   Katie Hopkins SLAMS Michael Sheen after he 'swaps acting for politics' His father Meyrick – who later became a professional Jack Nicholson impersonator – was a personnel officer for the British Steel Corporation while his mum Irene had worked at the plant as a secretary. Given this background perhaps we should not be surprised that the threat to the plant’s future that emerged earlier this year politicised Sheen as never before. And as a film star, who had followed fellow local heroes Richard Burton and Sir Anthony Hopkins to Hollywood, he had access to a media network eager to trumpet his views. At the weekend it was reported that Sheen, who made his name with uncannily realistic movie portrayals of Tony Blair, Brian Clough and Sir David Frost, was even ready to give up acting to devote his energies to fighting the rise of the “hard populist right”.   GETTYSheen grew up in the south Wales town of Port TalbotAt this point it’s easy to turn off and dismiss his ambitions as the virtue signalling of yet another Labour luvvie.  l think this is a case of looking at Port Talbot through Hollywood-tinted spectaclesPensioner Dai WilliamsBut unlike the Harrow-educated Benedict Cumberbatch, who harangued audiences at the Barbican after his performances in Hamlet with impromptu diatribes against our policy on Syria, Sheen appears to have more of a grip on real life. While he describes Ukip as “a bunch of numpties”, he does understand why 57 per cent of Port Talbot voters opted for Brexit. “It can’t be a coincidence that the communities who have had the greatest loss through de-industrialisation and have felt the loss hardest through globalisation, about manufacturing jobs going elsewhere… seem to have voted most to leave,” he said in an interview last month. “Taking back control is a very powerful message for those communities. ”Sheen also argued that, while Donald Trump may be the man “with the orange face and a squirrel on his head”, the US president-elect understood that segments of the American electorate were deeply concerned about trends such as manufacturing jobs disappearing abroad and stagnating rates of pay.But he adds: “What must be resisted is the re-emerging spectre of fascism in the West. Our democracy must be defended and each of us needs to decide how we can contribute to that effort.” Sheen’s first high-profile foray into UK national politics came in June when he fronted a BBC Wales documentary entitled, Michael Sheen: The Fight For My Steel Town.   GETTYNews of his intentions to quit acting hit the headlines on Saturday The programme was a response to the news that the Indian conglomerate Tata – which acquired the Port Talbot plant in 2007 when it bought Corus Steel UK – was selling its loss-making UK steel business following devastating losses caused by its dwindling share of the global market, because of China “dumping” cheap steel.But, while Sheen remains a popular fi gure in his home town, his implied criticisms of his erstwhile neighbours have not gone down well. Pensioner Dai Williams said: “l think this is a case of looking at Port Talbot through Hollywood-tinted spectacles. The problems we have here are economic, not political.” Railway worker Brian Rendall, 49, added: “There’s isn’t the slightest risk of fascism here. Sheen seems to be a nice bloke but he sounds a bit misguided. He should stick to acting and leave the politics alone. We’ve got quite enough luvvies in this country already.” THE BREXITEERS Sun, January 17, 2016Brexit: Independent experts have drawn up a list of the most influential people on Brexit Play slideshow  1 of 51

    After news of his intentions hit the headlines on Saturday, Sheen was keen to row back from the idea that he might be quitting the movie business entirely and relocating from Tinseltown to Port Talbot. In a blog posted later that day he wrote: “I DID NOT declare that I’m ‘quitting acting and leaving Hollywood’ to go into politics. In the original interview I said I have become more involved with community issues back at home over the last few years and because of the political situation it’s something I would like to focus on more. “The interviewer asked what that meant for my career and I said it might mean I work less as an actor and maybe even stop for a while AT SOME POINT. But I don’t really know yet.” Meanwhile, Port Talbot’s future is looking brighter , helped in part by the slump in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote making its exports cheaper. Tata has taken its Welsh operations off the market and is negotiating a long-term deal with its workforce.
