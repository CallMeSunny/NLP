  S MAGThe Queen is making her first Christmas radio broadcast in 1952 (right)Guests at Buckingham Palace had barely laid their George IV cutlery upon their silver-gilt Louis XVI plates when the President dropped his almighty clanger.They were only beginning to digest their roulade of sole, Windsor spring lamb and vanilla and cherry charlotte, when things started to go awry in the palace ballroom as Barack Obama attempted to toast his distinguished host.The Commander-in-Chief was not even three quarters of the way through praising the Queen when the unthinkable happened – the orchestra accidentally struck up God Save The Queen about a minute too early. Prince Philip once described her as “the Commonwealth’s physiotherapist”Her Majesty's private secretary Philip MooreInexperienced in the nuances of ancient Royal protocol, Mr Obama pressed on, seemingly oblivious to the blunder as he raised his glass to the monarch, only to find himself rebuffed by Her Majesty.An excruciating 20 seconds passed by before the Queen – bound by centuries-old protocol that dictates that one must stand to attention when the national anthem is played – could returnthe gesture.

    Keen to minimise her guest’s embarrassment she leaned over, smiled and said, “That’s very nice, thank you,” before finally raising her own glass to the most powerful man in the world.It was a tiny moment in a landmark reign that demonstrated why, as she celebrates her 90th birthday on Thursday, the Queen has gained a reputation as a world-renowned diplomat. Of course, when you are as well-travelled as the Queen, things are bound to go wrong, despite the months of planning that go into state visits.She may have overtaken Queen Victoria as the longest-serving monarch in British history last September – but her reign has been truly record-breaking when it comes to the countries she has visited: a staggering 128 and counting. Quite a feat for someone who has never owned a passport.From the Cocos Island (with a population of 596) to the vast People’s Republic of China, the Queen is certainly the most well-travelled monarch in history, full stop. She has visited Canada over 22 times – more than the total of all her great-great grandmother Victoria’s official foreign excursions combined. Although travel is obviously much easier now.Transatlantic trips have often been somewhat gaffe-prone. It was during a state visit to the US in 1991 when the American nation found itself being addressed by the Queen’s hat.No one thought to adjust the microphone after George Bush Senior finished speaking – all 6ft 2in of him. It later emerged that the 5ft 4in Queen was supposed to stand on a red carpeted box that was hidden inside the lectern, but the Chief of Protocol was too busy chatting to the First Lady to instruct someone to get it out.   S MAGThe Princess on a Royal tour of South Africa in 1947The Washington Post had a field day with the President the next morning but the Queen took it all in her diminutive stride. Addressing a joint meeting of Congress the following day, she puckishly asked members if they could see her now.When President Gerald Ford asked the Queen to dance at a White House dinner in 1976, she kept her cool and smiled serenely when the United States Marine Band launched into a loud rendition of The Lady Is A Tramp.Thirty one years later, George W Bush attempted to reference that visit when welcoming the Queen once again to the White House in 2007.“Her Majesty helped our nation celebrate its bicentennial in seventeen-seven…,” he proudly announced, before trailing off, realising he’d just made the monarch a good 200 years old. “In 1976,” he finished, with a sheepish pause. The Queen just smiled. When she heard that former American President and peanut farmer Jimmy Carter had once affronted the Queen Mother by kissing her full on the lips, she reportedly laughed out loud.  Queen Elizabeth II: 90 of her most candid snaps Sun, June 12, 2016To help celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's 90th birthday we have collated 90 of her most candid pictures.

    Which probably explains why she didn’t flinch at Michelle Obama’s over-familiarity when the First Lady put her arm around her shortly after they first met in 2009. (Perhaps it’s a girl thing. When Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating put his arm around the Queen during her 1992 tour of Australia he was dubbed “the Lizard of Oz”. Eight years later, his successor John Howard was accused of the same after being photographed with what appeared to be his arm around her, although he strenuously denied contact was made.)Acutely aware of the importance of Anglo-American relations, it’s no wonder the Queen glossed over “Toastgate”, telling President Obama and VIP guests including Kevin Spacey and Tom Hanks: “Our relationship goes far beyond our military and diplomatic ties. We are here to celebrate the tried, tested and – yes – special relationship between our two countries.”Suffice to say, the state banquet proved a success – as did the Obamas’ three-day visit. The President even gave the Queen a leather-bound album of her father George VI’s 1939 visit to the US with the Queen Mother (when they first met in 2009, he gave her an iPod loaded with Broadway hits and video footage of her state visit to the US in 2007).For former ambassador Charles Crawford, the Queen’s handling of the faux pas was emblematic of her entire reign. He said: “A brilliant example of Her Majesty’s diplomacy was that state banquet at Buckingham Palace in 2011. “The American President suffered an awkward moment when he broke royal protocol by speaking over the UK national anthem.“If you watch closely at what’s happening, you can see the Queen looking down at the notes in front of them, trying to work out what’s gone wrong. She calmly respects the anthem, then smiles sweetly to President Obama afterwards. “As far as I know, she has never made any protocol slip at all, in 64 years on the throne, which is technically astonishing. Not one. She is practically perfect in that respect – if anything’s innate then it’s this sense of how to perform the role.That sense of just the right way to behave is consistently maintained. It gives people a reassurance, and that’s important. Of course, mistakes happen – but they are not the Queen’s mistakes.”  S MAGThe Queen smiles as she and the Duchess of Cambridge enjoy a children’s sports event in 2012The former British diplomat, who worked for the Foreign Office for 28 years, helped to oversee the Queen’s state visit to Moscow in 1994, the first time a British monarch had visited Russia since the Revolution. He recalled a British blunder when the Queen visited Warsaw two years later.An error with the invitations led to several Polish VIPs arriving at the state banquet only to find they were not on the final guest list. “There they were, ready for perhaps the greatest night of their lives, and because we made a ghastly mistake they had to return home,” he said.The Queen made up for it by inviting the snubbed diners to a private audience the next day.“She made sure they had quality time with her the following morning. This attentiveness when things go wrong is so impressive.” As Andrew Marr pointed out in his 2012 book The Diamond Queen: “She has never seen herself as just, or perhaps even, mainly, the British Queen.”The woman who Nelson Mandela used to call “my dear friend Elizabeth” inherited a disintegrating Empire when she acceded the throne on February 6, 1952.Only five years earlier, on her 21st birthday, she had famously pledged to dedicate her life to the service of the Commonwealth.During a tour of South Africa, she gave a radio broadcast in Cape Town that has gone on to become one of her most seminal speeches. She said: “I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.” True to her word, a few months after her Coronation in 1953, she left for a six-month tour of the Commonwealth, visiting 13 countries in the West Indies, Australasia, Asia and Africa, covering 43,618 miles by land, air and sea.Thousands flocked to the banks of the River Thames to see her arriving home on the Royal Yacht Britannia. She had circumnavigated the globe, opened seven parliaments, made 157 speeches and four broadcasts – and she was only 28 years old.    In the intervening years, a great many of the nations of which the Queen was once head of state have become republics. Of the 53 members of the Commonwealth, only 16 retain the sovereign. Throughout troubled and often turbulent times, she has strived to remain neutral in a bid to transcend party politics – occasionally against the advice of her own Government. She insisted on travelling to Ghana in 1961, four years after she was removed as the country’s head of state and despite recent bombings in Accra, prompting Prime Minister Harold Macmillan to note: “She means to be a Queen and not a puppet.”Then she shunned risks for her own safety again by attending the 1979 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Lusaka, Zambia.She was said to be furious when Margaret Thatcher tried to stop her. The Prime Minister feared the monarch might become embroiled in a Commonwealth row, which had plagued the organisation since Ian Smith’s Unilateral Declaration of Independence of 1965. There were even concerns surface-to-air missiles might be used to attack the Queen’s plane. Once inside the Zambian capital she used her royal clout to persuade then President Kenneth Kaunda and his main political adviser Mark Chona to drop parts of a planned speech that would have offended people who didn’t want to hear men like Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo being described as “freedom fighters”. Her private secretary Philip Moore later wrote: “The Queen intervened personally with the President.This the Queen did in the motor car and later that evening, Mark Chona came to see me to say that the President had agreed to make all the amendments for which we’d asked.”The Lusaka summit paved the way for a final settlement to the problem of Rhodesia, a ceasefire by the (short-lived) Patriotic Front and elections involving all parties in February 1980, which were won by Robert Mugabe’s Zanu PF. (The Queen would later strip the evil dictator of the honorary knighthood he was awarded in 1994 after the Foreign Office cited his “consistent campaign of human rights violations and disregard for the democratic process.”)Then Foreign Secretary Dr David Owen later wrote about how steady the Queen had remained during the difficult talks about Rhodesia: “It would have been awfully easy for the Queen to come down on the side of those right-wing critics of Rhodesia, who were calling me a terrorist for getting involved with Nkomo and Mugabe.” No wonder Prince Philip once described her as “the Commonwealth’s physiotherapist”.   S MAGThe Queen, Prince Charles and Camilla, enjoy a laugh during the Braemar Gathering in September, 2006In his book The English Constitution, 19th- century journalist Sir Walter Bagehot wrote a monarch’s role was: “The right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.”As Ann Morrow put it in her 1983 book, The Queen, Her Majesty understood that it was “important that her role was seen not as that of an old-fashioned Queen Empress, but more as a high-powered influential friend who understood their affection for the Club, even if it had become temporarily unfashionable”. Her role as healer, comforter, consoler and counsellor at every CHOGM since Ottawa in 1973 has been integral to her reign. One Australian paid tribute to her skill during a past summit when he described her as “a grandmother cooling the family squabbles”. The Queen knows most of the leaders more than they know each other, meaning that she can act as independent arbiter of their affairs.But that’s not to say her Commonwealth subjects have always warmed to her.She was pelted with eggs in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1986 – prompting her to joke afterwards, “I myself prefer my New Zealand eggs for breakfast.”And there was an apparent assassination attempt near Sydney in 1970 when suspected republicans allegedly tried to derail the royal train by placing a large log on the tracks. But the driver was going so slowly that it did no damage and the Queen and Prince Philip remained blissfully unaware of the incident.It was during that trip Down Under that the Queen undertook her first royal “walkabout” – a feature of every foreign tour since.Being of the opinion that monarchy “should be seen to be believed”, the Queen wears bright colours precisely so people can pick her out of a large crowd.

    Keen to press the flesh with as many of her subjects as possible – both at home and abroad – she has become what one close observer described as “the mistress of small talk”.The source, who has worked with the Queen at close quarters, said: “When she chats, she’s alert and smart and has an uncanny knack of remembering things. She has a phenomenal memory and is impeccably well briefed. “She’s also very good at asking open questions to get people chatting, which is the mark of a skilled diplomat. Of course, her experience on the international stage is unparalleled, and that counts for a great deal. “She’s been doing this role for a very long time, seen leaders come and go, even countries come and go. But what’s really unusual about the Queen is that she is above politics. She is unlike any other leader in that she recognises it isn’t all about her but her relationship and interaction with her people.”Charles Crawford added: “In foreign countries there is often endless elaborate protocol around leaders. The Queen, however, doesn’t want that. She wants to get down to business. There is a steely practicality about her. She sets a unique tone of informal formality – light touch. It’s all very subtle.“For instance, politicians often have massive motorcades stopping traffic. They don’t care who they inconvenience. But not the Queen – she doesn’t want to intrude into people’s lives. She insists on the least disruption possible. It’s very unusual – a leader who actually respects the public. It’s supremely effective and impressive, and it shows why her visits advance British diplomatic interests.“I remember walking around Westminster one day and suddenly I looked up to see the Queen’s car waiting near the Houses of Parliament. There she was, just sitting there in the back, waiting without a fuss. Obviously the car had arrived early to an engagement. She wanted to walk through the door at the exact second she was supposed to. There was no obvious heavy security. No flimflam, all very understated – it’s incredibly professional.”   S MAGThe Queen and Prince Philip  wave on her Golden Jubilee in June 2002 While the Queen’s globetrotting has played an enormous part in strengthening friendships and economic ties between the UK and other countries – there have also been hugely significant historical visits. The Queen made the first state visit by a reigning monarch to China in 1986, visiting the Great Wall, Russia in October 1994, Brunei in 1998 and South Korea in 1999.In March 1995, she spent six days in South Africa after the end of apartheid.Even though Buckingham Palace announced that she would not be travelling long-haul after her 2011 visit to Australia, the Queen continues to make an impact wherever she goes and some of her most important overseas trips have only happened in recent years and on our doorstep. Her 2014 visit to the Vatican City to meet Pope Francis, then 77, was a particular highlight, having previously met Pius XII in 1951, John XXIII in 1961, John Paul II in 1980, 1982 and 2000, and Benedict XVI during his visit to the UK in 2010. On giving the current Pontiff a set of framed, signed photographs of herself and Prince Philip, the Queen joked: “I’m afraid you have to have a signed photograph, it’s inevitable.”During a tour of Germany last June, she visited the site of the Second World War concentration camp, Bergen-Belsen, before laying a wreath in memory of the thousands of Jews who died there, including teenage diarist Anne Frank. It was the first time the Queen had visited a concentration camp and aides said she had specifically requested the trip with Prince Philip. There was no pomp and ceremony, just a couple from the wartime generation taking their time to pay their respects.After survivors and liberators told them about their shared experience of horror, the Queen said to one person: “It’s difficult to imagine, isn’t it? It must have been horrific.” In her state banquet speech in Berlin she reflected on her first visit to Germany since 1965, saying, “In the 50 years since our first visit, our countries have lived through many profound changes.”   But it was Her Majesty’s state visit to Ireland five years ago that will be forever hailed as one of the most significant events in her six-decade reign.Dubbed an “extraordinary moment in history”, the four-day tour was the first time a British king or queen had visited the Emerald Isle since 1911.Emblematic of the progress that has been made between the two countries, the Queen’s speech at Dublin Castle made her an unlikely star.After laying a wreath at the Croke Park stadium where 14 people were killed by British forces 91 years earlier, she said, “To all those who have suffered as a consequence of our troubled pastI extend my sincere thoughts and deep sympathy.“With the benefit of historical hindsight we can all see things which we would wish had been done differently or not at all.”Of all the handshakes over the years, arguably the most symbolic was when she took Martin McGuinness’s hand in hers during a visit to Northern Ireland the following year. The conciliatory gesture towards the Deputy First Minister spoke volumes not only of how far the Peace Process had come, but also the vital part Her Majesty had played in it.Here was the Head of the Monarchy, long vilified by Nationalists, offering the hand of friendship to a former commander of the IRA that in 1979 had blown up Lord Mountbatten, Prince Philip’s uncle and Prince Charles’s beloved “mentor”.McGuinness later paid tribute to the Queen for being “miles ahead” of political leaders in Ireland and Britain in terms of achieving real progress in the Peace Process. “I think she sets an example that others should follow,” he said.Peter Hain, who was Secretary of State for Northern Ireland from 2005 to 2007 during the signing of the St Andrews Agreement, which built on the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in devolving power to Northern Ireland, believes the Queen helped to create a “metamorphosis” in the once divided country.“Previously the Royal Family was seen as the embodiment of an alien British state by the Nationalist community,” said the former Labour MP. “Now she is welcomed. The handshake was a very important symbol of the healing within Northern Ireland.” Related articles   Queen relaxes after hectic visit of Chinese premier with serene ride around Windsor Castle  Windsor Castle – a look inside the Queen's home  Prince Harry views the Queen as his boss  Elizabeth at 90: Happy Birthday, Your MajestyLaurence Robertson, chairman of the Northern Ireland select committee, accompanied the Queen on some engagements during her 2011 visit to the Republic.“People were a bit surprised by how well it went. I think that’s largely because of the Queen’s experience and that of her advisers but also Ireland put a great deal into it,” said the Conservative MP.“When she first got there she was wearing an emerald green outfit and spoke a few words in Irish. She went to the Garden of Remembranceand Croke Park, scene of the 1920 Bloody Sunday massacre, and was prepared to remember the past, saying, ‘We can’t forget what has happened,’ and I think people were very pleased she was strong enough to do that and that paved the way towards a better future together. “The division along religious grounds has only ever been exploited by a few people. The Queen has always been above all that. She has always represented the sensible approach.”Not only the sensible approach – but the subtle one. Charles Crawford has written speeches for members of the Royal Family and said the Queen’s words are “always controlled, yet say a lot”.He added: “The Royal Family in its gracious understated way can convey subtle messages. They express a great deal between the lines. “The people close to the Queen are very good at framing the message she has to convey. Take Ireland – that speech was not something an elected head of state would have delivered. The subtle substance, tone and warmth of the Queen’s words always speak for themselves.”  S MAGWelcoming former South African president Nelson Mandela to Buckingham Palace in 2003Having never granted any interviews, we have often had to glean the Queen’s thoughts from her speeches and Christmas broadcasts (something she pioneered back in 1952, the first of which was televised five years later).She famously described 1992 as her “annus horribilis” after three of her four children separated and Windsor Castle was partially destroyed by fire.In 1997, she gave an unprecedented televised address to the nation amid an unprecedented outpouring of grief for Princess Diana, when the Royal Family was criticised for its “cold” reaction to her death in a Paris car crash.By speaking to her subjects “from the heart”, as “Queen and as a grandmother”, she managed to win back the support of a public who realised that she wasn’t lacking in feeling, just bound by tradition.Later that year, the monarch paid tribute to her husband as they marked their Golden Wedding anniversary, describing Prince Philip as “my strength and stay all these years”. For every step of her journey as Queen, the 94-year-old Duke has been by her side (or more accurately, several paces behind). When she became queen at 25 with two small children, she is reported to have commented, “In a way I didn’t have an apprenticeship. My father died much too young and so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can.” It was simply a case of getting on with it.  S MAGWith Pope Francis at The Vatican in 2014Both a stickler for tradition and a forward-thinking moderniser, arguably the secret to the Queen’s success has been her willingness to embrace change. As she said in an address to both Houses of Parliament back on her Golden Jubilee in 2002, “For if a Jubilee becomes a moment to define an age, then for me we must speak of change. “Change has become a constant, managing it has become an expanding discipline. The way we embrace it defines our future.”Prime Minister David Cameron once described her as leading “a gentle evolution of our monarchy, bringing it close to the people while maintaining its dignity”. When she became Britain’s longest- serving monarch last September, the Queen admitted, “It is not a record to which I have ever aspired.”She was about to open a new railway in Scotland when she paid fleeting reference to the historic milestone in her short speech.“Inevitably, a long life can pass by many milestones. My own is no exception,” she said with typical understatement. “But I thank you all and the many others at home and overseas for your touching messages of great kindness.”With characteristic pragmatism, she added, “So now to the business in hand…”Even at 90, there is no question that the Queen will continue to put duty first, as she vowed to her Commonwealth subjects on her 21st birthday.It was one thing for a young Princess to utter those inspiring words – but quite another to have lived by them for more than 60 years.
