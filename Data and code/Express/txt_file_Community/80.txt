   The Deputy Prime Minister warned a decision to hold a second referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union could be seen as an "attempt by the political elite to set aside a democratic verdict that they had found unwelcome”. Mr Lidington added a second referendum could be "polarising" and he did "not think it would solve anything". "That would pose a risk of a radicalisation of a lot of those people into more populist positions. Related articles   Ex-Minister launches SHOCK Brexit attack on Bank of England   RELIEF!

This deal is not perfect, but the Prime Minister has done remarkable work putting together a compromise as good as this."The agreement does not give any one group everything they want, but it does have something for everyone."It puts in place controls on migration, protects jobs in the manufacturing industry and frees us from the political institutions of the EU."Most of all it gets us out of the EU, and it respects the referendum result."

MP Jo Johnson fires warning shot over Mrs May's Brexit deal (Image: Getty)7.20pm update: May's deputy warns second referendum could risk 'RADICALISATION' of right wing voters David Lidington said there could be an "ugly" reaction to any decision to hold another vote on the UK's membership in the EU. He warned such a move could be seen as an "attempt by the political elite to set aside a democratic verdict that they had found unwelcome".Mr Lidington also said a second referendum could be "polarising" and he did "not think it would solve anything".He said: "That would pose a risk of a radicalisation of a lot of those people into more populist positions."Let's say that it came out with a narrow majority for Remain, which it might do, 52-48 the other way."You would then have calls from the Leave side that this was unfair, promises have been broken and two years down the line something would be happening, there would be some new cause of discontent that would lead to calls for a third referendum."Even more seriously, I worry, in the case of a second referendum, people who voted to Leave were told at the time - everyone was told at the time - that this is decisive."The parliament at Westminster said we are giving this choice to the people, we will abide by the result."I think that the probable populist reaction to setting aside that 2016 referendum verdict is likely to be more ugly than previous versions."6.30pm update: Scottish political parties to UNITE AGAINST the ToriesA joint motion by parties excluding the Conservatives in Edinburgh's devolved parliament aims to emphasise the anger felt in most of Scotland, which voted to remain in the EU during the referendum in June 2016.They claim the Prime Minister's Brexit deal was negotiated without considering their views, something the government denies. The group will propose a single motion opposing her EU Withdrawal Agreement in a debate at Holyrood. This will be backed by Labour, the Liberal Democrats, SNP and Scottish Greens. They said in a joint statement: "The day after the Prime Minister's stage-managed visit to Scotland, during which she failed to engage with any politicians or individuals who oppose her proposals, this unique and positive cooperation between four of the five parties at Holyrood indicates Scotland's strength of feeling on Brexit and the Prime Minister's untenable position, as well as illustrating the isolation of the Conservatives on this matter."

His anger should be a cause for celebration across this House.”5pm update: HUGE time May has spent in Commons debating and answering questions REVEALEDTheresa May has spent more than 18 hours in the chamber debating and answering questions from MPs since the Commons returned last month following the party conference season. A Downing Street spokewoman said it was "more than the equivalent" of taking a session of Prime Minister's Questions every day the House was sitting. In the past two weeks along, Mrs May has spent more than nine-and-a-half hours at the Commons despatch box.    4.30pm update: Sturgeon rages TV debate without other political leaders would be 'TRAVESTY OF DEMOCRACY'The BBC has annoucned Theresa May has agreed to a live debate with Jeremy Corbyn on December 11. The Labour leader is yet to agree to the event taking place on the BBC, indicating a preference for ITV's debate proposal. Mrs May has previously rejected calls for other political parties to take part in the debate, but the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have all said they should be included. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: "If this or any TV debate goes ahead without all options - including that of remaining in the EU - being included and given a voice, it will be an absolute travesty of democracy."4pm update: Pound falls to two-week low amid concerns around Parliament vote on BrexitThe pound fell to a two-week low on Thursday as concerns grow about Parliament's vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal and the Bank of England's warning of severe risks to the currency if Britain leaves the EU in a disorderly manner. Sterling was trading down 0.5 percent against the US dollar at $1.2760 and by the same margin against the euro at 89.14 pence.Fears around a no-deal Brexit had sent the pound falling to a two-week low earlier this week before it regained some losses. Currency analysts have warned a recovery is unlikely before the parliamentary vote on December 11, which will be a key risk event.Lee Hardman, an FX strategist at MUFG in London, said: "It looks on paper like parliament is going to vote against the deal, which will lead us into heightened uncertainty.”3.30pm update: Brexit is single 'biggest risk factor' to tourism in Northern Ireland Tourism in Northern Ireland is more vulnerable to Brexit that any other region because it relies so much on the British market for most of its income from the sector, it has been claimed.Tourism Ireland chief executive Niall Gibbons warned the UK leaving the EU was the single "biggest risk factor" for the tourism sector. Northern Ireland is expecting to welcome more than 2.2 million visitors by the end of this year - British visitors are expected to account for more than 60 percent of that figure. Mr Gibbons said: “It's an extremely important industry."Northern Ireland is more vulnerable than other areas because of its high dependency on the number of British tourists."We know from our research that if more people in Britain decide to stay at home it's more likely that Devon and Cornwall, the Lake District and Scotland would be the winners than Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and Channel Islands because it involves getting a plane or a boat.""It is more vulnerable because it does rely on the GB market for about nearly 70 percent of all its business."He warned a Brexit deal is needed to ensure economic certainty and stability within the industry.Mr Gibbons said: "When people are feeling uncertain, and if their pocket is going to get hit, the first thing that gets hit is discretionary spending which often is tourism."It's important that a deal gets done, because ultimately consumers require certainty in their lives, that's what keeps them travelling."

The next few weeks are highly unlikely to inject any festive cheer, especially if Theresa May's Brexit deal doesn't win backing from MPs."The denouement to more than two years of bewildering Brexit wheeler-dealing looks like it will be enacted precisely when many consumers would prefer to be thinking of a well-earned Christmas break, filled with family get-togethers, warmth and festivity."Brexit appears to be turning this year's season of goodwill into the season of uncertainty."3pm update: Eurozone bank sector prepared for hard Brexit - backs Bank of England's recession warningThe European Central Bank has revealed the eurozone banking sector is prepared for a hard Brexit, and said the Bank of England (BoE) was right to warn of a deep recession if Britain leaves the bloc without a deal. On Wednesday, the BoE warned the British economy could shrink by eight percent in a year in the event of a no-deal Brexit. European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos told a news conference: "Yesterday we had these reports from the UK Treasury and the Bank of England that I think made the correct point."The most important point made by yesterday's report is that in case of a disorderly Brexit, the UK economy would enter into a period of very, very big recession, GDP would drop in the area of eight percent.“We can't lose sight that the most relevant issue is that a disorderly Brexit would have a very big, major recessionary impact on the UK.”  Ford boss has warned a no-deal Brexit would be a "catastrophe" (Image: Getty)Paul Withers taking over live reporting from Joe Duggan.2.43pm update: Jo Johnson believes Theresa May’s Brexit deal risks ripping the union apartJo Johnson believes Theresa May’s Brexit deal risks ripping the union apart.The Ex-Transport minister, who resigned over Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement, fears the agreement could spell “political armageddon” for the Conservative Party.Mrs May’s deal would “roll out the red carpet for Jeremy Corbyn”.Mr Johnson said: “The “worst of all worlds Tory Brexit” label will become an albatross around our necks for years to come."In fact, as colleagues in Parliament have been warning in recent days, this deal pleases so few people that it could lead to electoral defeat on the scale of 1997 or worse, rolling out the red carpet to Corbyn. That is the double whammy."Our country will have suffered a right hook from a PM’s botched Brexit and then a left hook from the arrival of Communist ideologues."He added: "The PM’s deal will also of course weaken our union."1.58pm update: Remainer Greening urges second referendum ‘within 22 weeks’ of December voteTory former education secretary Justine Greening is adamant a new Brexit referendum could be organised and held in 22 weeks.Ms Greening, who backs a second EU vote, told an event in London: "I've worked out that you could plan and hold a referendum in 22 weeks."We could do that in 22 weeks. We could actually, after this vote on December 11, hold a referendum, potentially, on May 30 next year."We could, alongside that, choose to extend Article 50, I've suggested, by four months to July 29."

It's important that we get the agreement ratified that's on the table at the moment.“I keep pushing the point that we need frictionless trade at the borders as well."That's not quite crystal clear in the withdrawal agreement."1.30pm update: Brexiteers get last-ditch chance to change May's deal  MPs will debate Mrs May’s deal during five all-day sessions in Parliament ahead of the December 11 vote.During the five eight-hour debates, they will be able to table six amendments to the government’s motion before it goes to the Commons vote next month.The mammoth debating sessions will see Mrs May try to convince Conservative rebels to back her deal.A Labour amendment to the government motion aims to halt a “botched Brexit”.
