  GETTYMicrosoft wants its Windows 10 assistant Cortana to power your smart home appliances One of the headline features in Windows 10 is Cortana.The talkative voice assistant is accessed from the taskbar at the bottom of the display and is capable of answering general queries, scheduling appointments, tracking packages, teams, and flights, as well as opening any app on your system.But with the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update, Microsoft plans to expand on that functionality and allow the assistant to power Internet of Things (IoT) devices around your home.According to a presentation slide from the WinHEC conference in China, Microsoft has outlined the requirements for hardware manufacturers looking to roll-out connected devices alongside the Windows 10 Creators Update in March 2017."This will enable you to build devices with displays, so you get that immersive Cortana experience," Microsoft program manager Carla Forester explained."Any kind of smart device with a screen can now take advantage of Cortana."  MICROSOFT • ZDNET • THE VERGEThe presentation slide from Microsoft, detailing its plans for Cortana powered IoT devicesUnlike the Amazon Echo, Microsoft is keen for hardware manufacturers to include a built-in display.This display will allow the company to use the full Cortana user interface – with Microsoft listing fridges, thermostats, and toasters as example devices that we’ll see with the connected assistant included in the near future. And when you're not asking your fridge to schedule an appointment of you, or asking the toaster when your friend's flight gets in – Microsoft wants you to talk to your PC, too.The US technology company is also enabling far-field microphone support for upcoming Windows 10 computers.

    Sources within Microsoft claim the company is working on a Home Hub software feature that will turn supporting PCs into rivals for the Amazon Echo and Google Home.Although the new software is not expected until next year, Microsoft already appears to be laying the groundwork with hardware manufacturers.Microsoft has already partnered with Intel to enable device makers to build hardware that incorporates Cortana with the ability to support far-field speech commands and wake-on voice functionality. Microsoft Executive Vice President of the Windows and Devices Group, Terry Myerson told technology blog The Verge: "Customers are device creators."There's a lot of enthusiasm for wake on voice, devices with far-field voice capabilities, devices with small screens, large screens, and no screens at all."  MICROSOFT • GETTYMicrosoft's next Windows 10 update will take on Google Home and Amazon EchoMicrosoft does not plan on announcing any devices just yet.But the interview is a clear signal that the company is preparing for Windows 10 and Cortana to compete head-to-head against Amazon’s Alexa.Mr Myerson explained: "From a platform perspective, our goal is to build this platform that provides a set of silicon options for these device creators, that allows them to choose the screen sizes they're choosing, and allows them to decide whether they want touch or not, support pen or not. So they can pursue their own vision of what the ideal device is."According to whispers from within Microsoft, Home Hub would create a login-free desktop that shares resources between family members, including shopping lists and reminders.The software would also help Windows 10 users sync and control connected home devices with voice commands to Cortana.Home Hub friendly machines would be able to recognise voice commands from a much greater distance than most standard laptops or desktop computers.

    According to sources speaking with Windows Central, the Home Hub system could also integrate light and motion sensors to ensure the PC wakes up whenever someone enters the room. Provided the leak is accurate, it would be an interesting way for Microsoft to enter the market.Whereas the latest products from Google and Amazon require customers to buy separate hardware, Microsoft might theoretically bring the same functionality to your home with a free software upgrade.That will likely be a very compelling proposition for consumers.Microsoft is said to be asking manufacturers including HP and Lenovo to create Home Hub-optimised desktop machines ready to ship in late 2017.  GOOGLEGoogle Home is designed to plug into the wall in your home, and listen for your every commandThe Home Hub functionality is expected to appear via a number of software updates to Windows 10, scheduled throughout 2017.The blockbuster updates, codenamed RedStone 2, RedStone 3 and RedStone 4, will be pushed-out over the course of the year.Microsoft is already rolling-out early test builds of RedStone 2 to Windows Insiders.The beta versions have hinted at some new features coming to the operating system, including a new Windows Update icon, the ability to tweak the default range of Active Hours, and a feature that permanently hides the App list housed in the Start Menu.
