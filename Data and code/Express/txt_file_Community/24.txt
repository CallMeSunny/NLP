   The experiment was carried out over China Lake last October and could pave the way for the future development of autonomous weapon systems. In total, 103 miniature Perdix drones were dropped from an F/A-18 Super Hornet. With a wingspan of 12 inches, the drones operate under human control but appear to be able to think of themselves.

US MILITARYThe swarm is dropped from a jet and is likely to be used for surveillance  US MILITARYIt's the second time the US military has tested dronesThe drones were originally the idea of engineer students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and were first modified for military testing in 2013.Elizabeth Quintana from the Royal United Service Institute told the BBC: “When looking at how you deal with air defence systems that are optimised to spot very large, fast-moving aircraft, small, cheap disposable drones seem to be one solution”. In May, US Navy researches tested a similar drone that can be shot into the sky for rapid deployment. The Locust project showed drones being launched from the ground, designed to “overwhelm enemies” and act as “kamikaze missiles".There has been no date set for when either system will be signed off for combat.
