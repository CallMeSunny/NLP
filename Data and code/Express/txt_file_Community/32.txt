   The news comes after Donald Trump proposed to build an American “Space Force” earlier this month.A US official contended the Russian satellite orbiting the earth was acting suspiciously, labelling its recent launch as “a very troubling development”.According to the US official, the development justifies President Trump’s new “Space Force” branch of the armed forces.Yleem Poblete, the assistant secretary at the State Department’s Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, told a UN disarmament conference in Geneva on Tuesday: “Its behaviour on-orbit was inconsistent with anything seen before.

Mr Trump walks on the South Lawn of the White House after arriving on Marine One (Image: GETTY)More probable is a cyber attack - known as “soft-kill” - that could render communication obsolete.An RAF spokesman said: “The UK does not have the industrial muscle or money to do a hard-kill.“But the US probably will in the near future and the UK will look to get involved.“We do have some soft-kill capability, such as jamming.”   What is the new US Space Force?It is not currently clear the precise nature of the service - but it is thought to comprise a military force with fighting capabilities in space.Donald Trump has tasked the US Department of Defence and The Pentagon with the creation of a new force to uphold “American dominance” in space.Alongside the US Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard, it will comprise the sixth arm of the US armed forces. Mr Trump wants to counter Russian and Chinese developments in space tech.The US already has some space fighting capabilities, with long-range missiles to satellite tracking.Trump said in the East Room of the White House: “My administration is reclaiming America's heritage as the world's greatest spacefaring nation.“The essence of the American character is to explore new horizons and to tame new frontiers."
