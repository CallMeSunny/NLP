   Meanwhile Theresa May has been warned she is facing a wave of resignations if she blocks MPs from voting for a plan to rule out a no-deal Brexit, after the Prime Minister’s ‘Plan B’ was dismissed by Parliament. And former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith has urged her to get tough with Brussels by sending an "politically led" delegation for crunch talks – while saying anyone who thought the House of Commons could act as a government negotiating a trade deal was "living in cloud cuckoo land".

The Cyprus flag is on the 'white list' of both the Paris and Tokyo Memoranda of Understanding, resulting in fewer inspections and delays, and will result in significantly more favourable tonnage tax arrangements as the ships will be flagged in an EU member state."In Westminster, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd told Number 10 up to 40 ministers could quit unless they are allowed to support a backbench amendment extending Article 50 if a withdrawal agreement is not ratified within weeks. Labour’s Yvette Cooper and former Conservative ministers Sir Oliver Lewin and Nick Boles tabled the amendment, one of several which will be debated and voted on by the Commons on January 29.The Times reported a Conservative MP as saying: “Amber is telling Downing Street to make it a free vote on behalf of lots of people.”Pro-Europe ministers including Ms Rudd, Chancellor Philip Hammond and Business Secretary Greg Clark are piling pressure on Mrs May to rule out a no-deal withdrawal and pursue a softer exit strategy. While Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has refused to talk to the Prime Minister about a way forward until she “takes no-deal off the table”.  P&O will remove the Union Jack from its ferries (Image: GETTY)Mrs May has repeatedly refused to rule out no deal, saying doing so is "impossible" – but Ms Cooper’s amendment would force the government to ask the EU if it would be willing to push Article 50 back until the end of the year, thus delaying Brexit, if no deal is in place by the end of February, even though Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has warned there are no guarantees the bloc would agree to do so even if Britain asks for a delay.The Prime Minister unveiled her new proposals yesterday – but her announcement prompted many to suggest there was little difference between those which were voted down comprehensively last week, except the announcement that the £65 fee for EU citizens who want to stay in the UK was being waived. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: "This really does feel a bit like Groundhog Day.”Speaking to Today, Mr Duncan Smith urged Mrs May to play hardball, saying: "What we now need is absolutely, 100 percent, daily political leadership under the Prime Minister, reporting back."Meanwhile a senior Austrian minister has warned there was "no time" to make changes to the withdrawal agreement negotiated with Brussels and ratified in December.SCROLL DOWN FOR LIVE UPDATES 10:36pm update: Welsh First Minister reveals he does support a second referendumMark Drakeford said he would support a second Brexit referendum if the Commons came to a deadlock and were not able to agree to deal.Speaking to Channel 4 News, he said: "If the House of Commons is deadlocked, then what the answer cannot be is that that leads to no deal."In those circumstances, a deadlocked House of Commons, what option is there but to go back to the people that made the original decision and get their advice again?"The minister also warned that crashing out of the EU would cause "real" harm, as he called for the Prime Minister to take a no-deal Brexit off the table.10:04pm update: Brexit survival kit with food rations go on saleThe survival kit has been made to help Britons if there is a tricky situation after Brexit.Businessman James Blakes has sold hundreds of the “Brexit Box” for £295 to worried citizens.7:38pm update: Nicola Sturgeon is due to tell the Prime Minister she is pursuing the ‘IMPOSSIBLE’Nicola Sturgeon is due to warn Theresa May she is “pursuing the impossible” if she wants to change the Brexit backstop arrangements.Ahead of Wednesday’s talks, Ms Sturgeon said: “The UK is in the midst of the most serious political crisis in many decades - and it is entirely a mess of the Prime Minister's own making."With time running out, Theresa May needs to stop blaming everybody else and start listening.“Theresa May's current strategy is to rule out the possible - extending the Article 50 period - while pursuing the impossible - changes to the backstop."At today's meeting I will be making clear to the Prime Minister that it is she who needs to change her position - not everybody else."6:36pm update: Irish Government admits it would be difficult to avoid a hard border under no-deal BrexitForeign Affairs minister Simon Coveney has said he continued to prioritise the Withdrawal Agreement and the backstop insurance policy in his Brexit talks.Mr Coveney said: “In the absence of the backstop and a Withdrawal Agreement we have a very difficult job to do to prevent border infrastructure, but of course that would have to be our focus.”The Irish Government has insisted it will not put in place any infrastructure to check goods or people at the land border with Northern Ireland after Brexit.6:25pm update: MPs could be granted free votes on Brexit if no consensus on dealSolicitor General Robert Buckland said there is an argument to vote on their views and not necessarily by their party lines.Speaking on Radio 4 he said: “If we can't in these days ahead see the Government to rally around and support a particular approach that we can then take to Brussels and it's clear that we're getting to a stage where an impasse has been reached..."I think there is an argument, a strong argument, for parliamentarians to in effect replicate the positions that we all took in the referendum, which were not on party lines as we all know, and to exercise a vote according to what their views are and the views of their constituents and the businesses and what they judge to be in the national interest."That could be on a range of issues from second referendums through to no deal through to what type of future relationship we want."6:09pm update: Leaving EU in March with no deal would be 'risky' to Scotch whisky’s export growthThe Scotch Whisky Association has said that the UK leaving the EU in March without a deal would pose a risk to its current healthy rates of export growth.The group said: “Moreover, we have real concerns about the ability of port operators to cope with significant, last-minute changes to export systems, and the risk of disruption at ports i high.”Scotch whisky is Britain’s biggest food and drink export. 5:46pm update: Finance expert say second referendum is way forwardThe chief financial officer of the Standard Chartered bank has said a second referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU could be a way to break the deadlock in the talks.Speaking at the Global Economic Forum in Davos, Andy Halford said there was a “reasonably compelling argument” for giving the public a second vote.He said: “The Houses of Parliament are there democratically to represent the people and therefore ostensibly the decision should lie with them."However, in a situation where there is a gridlock in that body going directly to the people and hearing exactly what the people would want to do now that they have had two more years of information being fed to them - that has a strong argument for being a way forward in the event of the other options failing to reach a conclusion.”5:37pm update: Irish premier has said Ireland and UK must negotiate an agreement to AVOID a hard borderIn the event of a no-deal Brexit, Leo Varadkar said: “Both the UK and Ireland will have an obligation to honour the Good Friday Agreement, protect the peace process and honour our commitment to the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland, that there won’t be a hard border.“We would have to negotiate an agreement on customs and regulations that meant full alignment so there will be no hard border.”  A pro-EU placard outside Parliament today (Image: GETTY)5:20pm update: Brexiteer James Dyson moves HQ from UK to SingaporeThe staunch Leave supporter has said he wants his business to focus on the expanding Asian market for high-end consumer goods.The decision has been met with criticism given Sir James’ status as one of the main business leaders supporting Brexit.Last year Dyson announced it will manufacture its new electric cars in Singapore, rather than the UK.Chief Executive Jim Rowan said: “The move is nothing to do with Brexit or tax, it's about making sure we are future proofed.

It raises concerns."

Nobody should be put in that position."Objecting to Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch's accusations Ms Siddiq had delayed her caesarean to "make a point" on , Ms Swinson added: "Some have suggested she was just trying to make a point and I think that is disgusting."She was put in an impossible position and she made a choice, and the judgement that comes from all corners to parents making choices like this and all sorts of others is out of order and I think we should respect the choice she made."  Jo Swinson speaks in the Commons today (Image: Parliament TV)1.58pm update: MP defends Siddiq over claims she was "trying to make a point"Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson has hit back after a Tory MP claimed Labour's Tulip Siddiq only delayed her caesarean birth "to make a point".Saffron Walden MP Kemi Badenoch sparked anger after telling BBC's Politics Live yesterday: "I have heard Tulip Siddiq speak on this issue privately before, and I think irrespective of pairing, I think she wants to make a point that she is doing this for her constituents."Ms Swinson, speaking after Andrea Leadsom confirmed a pilot proxy voting scheme to prevent a repetition of the situation, said: "Some have suggested she was just trying to make a point and I think that is disgusting."1.50pm update: PM plays down concerns over medical supplies post-BrexitSpeaking in the Commons, Mr Stephens asked whether the cuts would interfere with medical supplies.However, Prime Minister Theresa May said: "The two points he has raised are not linked."In relation to the issue of medical supplies the DHSC has been working with pharmaceutical companies and others to ensure arrangements are in place so that medical supplies will be available in the event we leave with no deal."The Government's position is we want to leave with a deal – that's what we're working on, finding a deal that will secure the support of this House."1.47pm: Department for Health has lost nearly 400 civil servants since referendum, figures revealAlmost 400 civil servants have been cut from the Department for Health since the EU referendum.The SNP's Chris Stephens revealed official figures showing a reduction of 385 Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) civil servants in a parliamentary question.It's also been revealed that £1 million has been spent on fridges to be used by the department to stockpile medicines in the event of a no deal .Official figures show DHSC employed 1,589 civil servants as of December 20, 2018, compared to 1,974 civil servants on June 23, 2016 – the date of the vote.1.41pm update: Proxy voting trial for Commons in wake of Siddiq scandal, Leadsom confirmsProxy voting for new parents will be introduced in a one-year trial, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom has announced during an urgent question, in the wake of a situation in which Labour MP Tulip Siddiq ended up delaying her Caesarean birth in order to vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal last week.New mothers and fathers will be now able to nominate another MP as a proxy to vote on their behalf.Mrs Leadsom said MPs will have the choice to approve the pilot, based on the Procedure Committee report into the issue, in a motion on Monday January 28.She said: "I profoundly believe that all new parents should be able to spend uninterrupted time with their new baby."This is vital for both the physical and mental well-being of parents and babies."So I absolutely assure the House, I am absolutely committed to making progress on the issue of proxy voting and I am truly delighted to be able to confirm to the House today that a substantive motion on proxy leave in the case of maternity, paternity and adoption has been tabled today for the House's agreement on Monday 28 January."   1.29pm update: Government whip brands Lords decision "a tactic of obstruction"The Trades Bill, which has already cleared the Commons, aims to enable the UK to replicate, after, current trade agreements that the UK is party to as a member of the EU.But Baroness Smith of Basildon, Labour's leader in the Lords, warned it would be irresponsible to proceed without more information on the process of making international trade agreements post-Brexit and Parliament's role in it.The Government's chief whip, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, denounced the move as a "tactic of obstruction" and urged Labour to reflect on whether it was in their interests to pursue it.1.27pm update: "No rationale" for Lords decision, says May spokesmanPrime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman told reporters: "We are disappointed that the Lords have voted to prevent the Trade Bill from progressing at this crucial time."There is no rationale for this. We have always been clear that we are committed to a role for Parliament and the devolved administrations in scrutinising future trade agreements."The Trade Bill will progress through its committee stage as planned and we will consider how to address the motion laid to enable report stage to go ahead."1.24pm update: Government "disappointed" as Lords dish out another Brexit blowThe Government has said it is "disappointed" by its the defeat in the House of Lords over its plans for post-Brexit trade deals.In a highly unusual move, peers voted by a majority 35 on Monday to block the Trade Bill's report stage until they get fuller details of the plans.The change, branded a "tactic of obstruction" by the Government, has no impact on the four days of committee stage debate on the Bill starting on Monday.But it will mean the measure's subsequent report stage will not start until the Government has met Labour's demand to give Parliament more details on how international trade agreements are struck and scrutinised after .1.14pm update: Withdrawal treaty "not open for negotiation, says SchinasThe UK's commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, "will have to take inevitably into account this fact", Mr Schinas added.He insisted the EU would stand behind the peace accords which followed three decades of civil conflict.Mr Schinas said there was no change in the EU position after May said she would seek amendments to the draft withdrawal treaty.The text, he said, was "not open for negotiation".  Margaritis Schinas has said the withdrawal agreement is "not open for negotiation" (Image: GETTY)1.09pm update European Commission spokesman Schinas threatens Britain over backstopNorthern Ireland will automatically have a "hard border" with its southern neighbour if Britain leaves the European Union without a withdrawal agreement, Margaritis Schinas, the European Commission's chief spokesman, said on Tuesday.The remark to reporters by Mr Schinas reflected the European Union position that Ireland, like other member states, would have to enforce EU customs and other checks on imports from Britain after Brexit in the absence of a special deal.However, it was a relatively rare public statement of that legal position as Brussels and Dublin have pushed the British government to focus on agreeing to a withdrawal agreement to ease Britain's departure that would ensure the land border does not fuel renewed violence in long troubled Northern Ireland.Pushed to give the EU position on ensuring the border stays unencumbered as agreed in the 1998 peace accords for the British province, Schinas said: "If you'd like to push me and speculate on what might happen in a no-deal scenario in Ireland, I think it's pretty obvious – you will have a hard border."12.53pm update: "CBI will be included in conversation," May's spokesman comfirmsIncluded in Theresa May's call to businesses will be representations of the CBI, Federation of Small Businesses and Institute of Directors, her spokesman said.Mrs May's official spokesman said the call was an opportunity for the Prime Minister to provide an update on the state of  talks and for business leaders to raise any concerns they might have.Later in the week, Mrs May is due to meet trade union leaders, including Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, in Downing Street to discuss .The spokesman did not confirm the date of the meeting. Reports suggest it will take place on Thursday.12.50pm May "to call businesses to update them about Brexit plan"British Prime Minister Theresa May will hold a call with businesses today to update them on her Brexit plan and listen to their questions and concerns, her spokesman said.May's deal with Brussels was rejected by a large majority of lawmakers last week and the British leader has proposed seeking further concessions from the European Union on a plan to prevent customs checks on the Irish border.The spokesman said: "It's an opportunity to give an update to business in the way she gave an update to the House of Commons yesterday, but importantly it's an opportunity for business to ask questions and raise any issues or concerns they might have."Many business leaders have voiced concern about the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, which they say has hindered long-term planning.12.38pm update: Labour "playing politics" over Brexit, says HuntMr Hunt attacked Labour for "playing politics" with Brexit, citing how the shadow business secretary could not say if Labour supported a second referendum or not.He said: "That's not policy, it's politics. I simply say to her to play politics in a hung Parliament is a total betrayal of ordinary voters."Ms Thornberry dismissed the claim as "unconvincing" and "a bit desperate" and continued to press Mr Hunt on his statements about how the public had not been given the chance to vote on the terms of leaving the EU and warned of the risk of a no-deal .She added: "Even if he no longer believes the public should have a say on the final terms of a deal, does he at least still believe they should have a say if we are risking leaving with no deal at all?"Mr Hunt said there was "a very easy way" to stop no deal and that was to talk to the Prime Minister, saying: "The leader of the opposition talks without pre-conditions to Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA but not to the British Prime Minister."The reason is because their objective is not to have a deal but to have a crisis and what a betrayal of ordinary families that is."  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt clashed with Labour's Emily Thornberry in the Commons (Image: Parliament TV)12.35pm update: Hunt and Thornberry clash in Commons over BrexitForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been challenged on his U-turn over putting the  deal to a public vote, which he supported in the week following the EU referendum.During Foreign Office Questions, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry asked: "Four days after the referendum the Foreign Secretary said 'We need to negotiate a deal and put it to the British people, either in a referendum or through a fresh general election."'We will trust the British people to decide on whether or not it is a good deal'."So, can I ask him again why he no longer believes in trusting the British people to decide whether they want the Prime Minister's deal?"Mr Hunt replied "I do" before claiming more than 80 percent of voters in the 2017 election supported parties that wanted  by voting Tory, Labour or for a smaller party.He added: "I will happily take criticism of our  policy on the chin the moment Labour has the courage to have its own  policy in the first place."12.13pm update: Raab welcomes PwC surveyKevin Ellis, chairman of PwC, said: “For the UK, CEOs growing uncertainty about where to expand presents an opportunity to attract new investment following Brexit.“It’s time to talk up the UK’s credentials, not only as a competitive place for business, but as a fair and trusted one.“We’re at a pivotal moment in economic and political history. Now more than ever, CEOs have the chance to reset the narrative on the role of business in society and build trust.”Mr Raab – tipped as a contender to be the next leader of the Conservative Party – tweeted: “Welcome PWC survey finds that UK CEOs are confident about hiring extra staff and their prospects for growth in 2019.”12.11pm survey: British bosses expect to employ more people AFTER Brexit, survey saysA majority of UK chief executives expect to increase the number of people they employ this year, a survey has shown – with former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab hailing the news via social media.The research suggests 61 per cent of UK business leaders anticipate increasing headcount in 2019, up from 54 per centin 2018 and higher than the worldwide average of 53 per cent.UK bosses are also bullish about the chances of growth in the next 12 months, with 82 per cent confident about their revenue prospects.The global survey, published by audit firm PwC, suggested a slight dip in UK confidence over the next three years, with a six percent fall in those expecting growth over that period, from 96 per cent in 2018 to 90 per cent in 2019.11.59am update European Commission spokesman mocks Theresa May with Spice Girls quoteA European Commission spokesman said there was "nothing new" in what Mrs May was proposing, when asked about what happened if she returned to Brussels for talks.He channelled the Spice Girls' classic pop hit Wannabe, telling reporters in the Belgian capital: "The Withdrawal Agreement was agreed with the UK Government, with the EU27."It is now on the table, it is not open for negotiation and we expect the United Kingdom to tell us what they want, what they really, really want."  The spokesman asked Theresa May to tell the Commission what she "really, really wanted" (Image: GETTY)11.49am update: Corbyn “will back People’s Vote,” Labour MP predictsJeremy Corbyn will eventually back a second referendum, a Labour MP whose constituency voted to Leave by a large margin has predicted.Labour MP Bridget Phillipson, whose Houghton & Sunderland South constituency strongly backed Leave in 2016, told a People's Vote press conference in Westminster: "I know that Jeremy wants to make sure the decisions that we take as a party are the decisions that are in the best interests of everyone we serve."But I don't think the interests of working people will be served by a Brexit which will see jobs leave my community, which will see wages fall and see a real impact on living standards. I think when it comes down to it, Jeremy won't want to see that happen either."She added: "I think Jeremy understands that a majority of Labour voters and a vast majority of Labour members want us to campaign for a referendum. I think he is a democrat and he will ultimately respond to that."I also think Jeremy acutely feels, as we all do as Labour politicians, that we have to do what's right by working people in our country, and I'm confident that is the position that we will arrive at."11.39am Government "trying to close down debate," claims GrieveRemainer Dominic Grieve, whose Brexit amendment would enable Parliament totake control of the Brexit agenda and potentially enable a request to delay Article 50 to be submitted to the EU, has accused the Government of trying to "close down debate".He told Sky: "What my amendment does is to identify a number of Tuesdays between now and the date of Brexit in which the business will be controlled by the House itself and not by the Government."There will be a motion in neutral terms to start the day which is about looking at  and what is going on, then Members of Parliament can table amendments for consideration which can be turned into resolutions of the House."He added: "A resolution of the House is a pretty solemn thing."If the House says that it thinks something ought to be done which the Government isn't doing, the government can decide to ignore it but historically it would be very unusual in our constitution for that to happen."11.36am Dutch MEP takes swipe at Britain during DavosA Dutch MEP has taken a swipe at Britain after Prime Minister Theresa May opted not to attend the Davos economic summit in Switzerland.Marietje Schaake tweeted a picture of a billboard outside the summit featuring a Union Jack and the words: "Free trade is great."She added: "‘Free trade is great’ blasts Great-Britain to the Davos crowd as it struggles how to peel apart from its greatest trading partner..."

As Brexiteers we are open to putting our views forward, to listening, but I think ultimately what we would like to see is ensure the backstop, it’s got legal text attached to it, but also why are we giving the £39billion for virtually nothing in return.“So those are the two big things for us Brexiters.”For full story click here   11.09am update: Corbyn has shown "dreadful lack of leadership," claims Lib Dem deputy leaderLiberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson has launched a stinging attack on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, accusing him of “a dreadful lack of leadership"Speaking to a People's Vote press conference in London, Ms Swinson said it was now clear that Labour votes will be "pivotal" to the outcome of Brexit.She said: ”Labour is at a point now where it has to choose. The Labour leadership has been riding both horses for far too long."Labour can decide. Their votes will be pivotal. They can either make Brexit happen or Labour can stop Brexit. The time for decision is upon us."10.56am update: Brexit "worst case scenario," says IMF chiefIMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told CNBC on Tuesday that poses uncertainty for Europe and UK, claiming a no-deal was "obviously the worst case scenario".The IMF had warned in November that a no-deal  would cost Britain six pct of GDP.The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29.10.54am update: Attempts to block Brexit "spit in the face" of British electorate, says ex-MPFormer Tory MP Paul Goodman has said no-deal cannot be taken off the table – and warned anyone trying to block Brexit would be “spitting in the face” of the British people.In a blog for the Conservative Home website, which he now edits, Mr Goodman, who served as MP of Wycombe from 2001 to 2010, said: “No Deal cannot be “taken off the table”.“As it was put recently, No Deal is the table – in other words, it’s a form of Brexit.“If MPs want to stop No Deal, they must take away the table they asked for – Brexit – and put another one its place: No Brexit.“They’re entitled to make the attempt, though such a move would dynamite what’s left of Theresa May’s negotiating strategy, and spit in the face of the verdict of the British people. But can they please come clean about it?”10.35am update: Pound buoyant despite Brexit uncertaintySterling rose on Tuesday after strong employment data suggested Britain's labour market remained robust despite an economic slowdown ahead of Brexit.The pound jumped 0.3 percent to the day's high against the dollar and the euro after data showed British workers' pay growth hit a 10-year high.But the currency's gains could be fleeting, analysts said, since the chances of a Bank of England interest rate rise were unlikely to rise on the data due to the risk of a no-deal Brexit.Tyler Griffin, a currency specialist at OFX, said: "The earnings and unemployment figures have been somewhat overshadowed by continued chaos. Investors are focused on how PM Theresa May will negotiate with the EU over the next few days."10.23am update: "The fundamentals have not changed," says CBI bossMs Fairburn added: "While the Government’s move to consult more widely is welcome, as is the commitment to scrap the settled status charge for EU citizens, the fundamentals have not changed. Parliament remains in deadlock while the slope to a cliff edge steepens.“The Government should accept that no deal in March 2019 must be off the table. Politicians on both sides of the Commons need to step back from their increasingly entrenched positions.“It is vital they focus on three key principles: a deal that commands consensus in Parliament, can be negotiated with the EU and protects livelihoods in communities across the UK. There must be a new cross-party approach, where leaders compromise and find a path that safeguards the economy.”10.21am update: "Rule out no-deal," CBI chief pleadsCBI director-general Carolyn Fairburn has urged Proime Minister Theresa May to “take no deal off the table” in the wake of yesterday’s updated Brexit proposals.A CBI analysis published today suggested a no-deal situation could cost Scotland £14billion annually by 2034, while Northern Ireland would be hit by £5billion a year.Ms Fairborn was speaking on the day the CBI published an analysis suggesting a no-deal situation could cost Scotland £14billion annually by 2034, while Northern Ireland would be hit by £5billion a year.She added: “This is another bleak day for business."10.04am update: Warehouses running out of space as a result of Brexit fears, survey suggestsWarehouse space is in short supply as Brexit approaches, with three-quarters of warehouse owners saying they have no room left, and storage costs rising by 25 percent.A survey undertaken by the UK Warehousing Association (UKWA) of more than than 700 of its members indicated there was a shortage of space as a result of people stockpiling goods in fear of a no-deal situation.The research suggested 85 percent of members had received Brexit-related requests.About 75 per cent were then unable to take on more business, with 60 per cent being forced to turn customers away. Businesses have been seeking storage for goods such as food ingredients, packaging materials and consumer products in case stocks run low.UKWA CEO Peter Ward said: “The rising demand for warehousing is already apparent as our members are reporting, but there is a serious shortage of space which is simply being exacerbated by the Brexit effect.”  Sir Bill Cash said Britain can look to the future "with confidence" (Image: GETTY)9.53pm update: Cash urges Britain to look "with confidence" to the futureMr Cash said Britain should look “with confidence” to its own future, rather than relying on the bloc’s “aloof bureaucrats”.He said: “With the euro stagnating, youth unemployment between 20 and 50 per cent in many EU countries, Germany in technical recession, Greek democracy shattered, and France steeped in riots, we should look with confidence to our own future.“As aloof bureaucrats who were voted by nobody give succour to the far-right across the continent, it is clear that the failing institutions of EU integration are the wrong side of history."With our dynamic skilled workforce, the English language, and our global opportunities under WTO rules, a rejuvenating atmosphere of freedom – both democratic and economic – means an exit without a deal is what Britain can now embrace."9.48pm: A WTO Brexit “would boost GRP by seven percent,” claims Brexiteer MP CashBrexiteer Sir Bill Cash has said Britain must now “seize the opportunity” presenting by a no-deal Brexit after Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit divorce deal was voted down last week.Writing on the website of pro-Brexit campaign group Brexit Central, Mr Cash said: “Now the Withdrawal Agreement and all the negotiations have been so roundly defeated, it is the moment to seize the opportunity to vigorously promote the WTO way forward.“There is no signed agreement, and there is no legal obligation to abide by its costly rules. Let us now be confident in the enormous opportunity which presents itself.It has been calculated that a WTO Brexit would produce a GDP boost of seven per cent to the UK economy over the next 15 years which would be worth about £140 billion.“Furthermore countries outside of the Single Market have increased their exports faster than Britain has to the EU over the last 30 years. Even Peter Mandelson admitted the Single Market has its downsides, estimating the cost of EU regulation at four per cent of GDP.”9.24am update: Pound boosted by Brexit optimismSterling firmed on Monday after British Prime Minister Theresa May promised to be more open with parliament in negotiating the country's future relationship with the European Union.Chris Turner, head of foreign exchange strategy at ING in London, said: "The overall probability of a market-friendly  outcome is currently helping sterling."Yet with the no-deal option still on the table, the probability weighted outcome for EUR/GBP is 89 pence based on our estimate."With the clock ticking down to March 29, the date set in law for , the UK is in the deepest political crisis in half a century as it grapples with how, or even whether, to exit the European project it joined in 1973.9.17am update: "No time" to make changesMs Kneissl said there was no time to make changes that could not be agreed on during years of negotiations.She said: "The Withdrawal Agreement was negotiated along the red lines the British Government have put."We respected always these red lines and I don't believe that things that couldn't be achieved over the past three years can be achieved now within the context of a few weeks."Asked about the EU's position on an extension of Article 50, she added: "We have been waiting for British action for past years and now, ever since late November, ever since the Withdrawal Agreement was decided upon by British Government approval on November 25, things went somehow in all kinds of directions."My impression is that on the European Union side there is a very strong desire to have a very clear-cut position. Where is the added value of the new British suggestion?"Because we have said it always. This is the agreement and it is the best agreement that could be achieved together with the British."9.15am Austrian minister downplays "surprise" Polish backstop suggestionAustrian foreign minister Karin Kneissl has sought to distance the EU from a suggestion by her Polish counterpart Jacek Czaputowicz that the Irish border backstop could be limited to five years to allow a deal to pass the UK Parliament.Ms Kneissl told BBC's Today programme she had spoken to her Irish counterpart Simon Coveney at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday and he made it clear "Ireland belongs to the 27" and "anything that was negotiated by commissioner Michel Barnier was part of the position that Ireland was part of".She added: "We were all taken by surprise when the Polish minister made his statement."We have had cohesion and we wish to continue having cohesion on the EU27 position, so the statement by our Polish colleague came as a surprise, but I don't believe that it will cause some sort of breakthrough, certainly not because if we start having all kinds of bilateral suggestions it doesn't lead us anywhere."

The Prime Minister was very clear yesterday and there is collective responsibility in Cabinet and among ministers – they have agreed there will be no extension of Article 50, there will be no revocation of Article 50 and no customs union."8.44am update: Labour does NOT back second referendum, insists shadow business secretary Long BaileyShadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said an amendment it has tabled did not "in any way" mean it was backing calls for a second referendum – despite the apparent popularity of the idea among the party’s rank and file.Labour wants Parliament to be given the option to back a national poll on Brexit when MPs vote on the Government's EU exit stance next week.Asked about the carefully-worded amendment on Today, she said: "The amendment is very specifically-worded to allow for the debate of the options."It is not stating that the party supports a second referendum in any way and indeed if it was passed, the amendment, and it went to a vote on the specific issues, then that would be a decision for the party to take at the time."We are prioritising seeking a deal which provides many of the assurances we have sought from the PM."She added that if the amendment was passed and a referendum became a "real prospect" then "certainly a decision would have to be made in relation to the party's position about whether they supported a) a people's vote being the only option left or b) whether they were going to allow MPs to vote on an individual basis."8.41pm update: “No guarantees EU will even agree to extend Article 50,” warns Brexit Secretary BarclayBrexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has reminded MPs European politicians might not support an extension to Article 50 even if the UK asked for one.He told Today: "It is not in the unilateral gift of the UK to extend. There are practical issues."I think that support for an extension is an over-simplification because there are many in the European Parliament and elsewhere that are concerned about an extension in terms of the impact."He added: "There are many in Brussels that are concerned about the prospect of an extension in terms of the interplay with the European parliamentary elections, because you couldn't pass the legislation in the UK for a referendum in the time before the end of May.""But also from the EU point of view, they have been very clear that they don't want an extension with no purpose and so we come back to the issue as to what it is MPs are for and just what they are against."

Could the prime Minister share with us some of the helpful things the Polish Government is doing help us and encourage others come and see?”Prime Minister Theresa May said: “I look forward to exploring in more detail the proposals that have been put forward by the Polish Foreign Minister on this particular issue of dealing with the backstop.
