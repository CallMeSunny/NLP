It’s no longer obsolete.”Mr Stoltenberg praised the President for his “dedication” to Nato, despite Mr Trump’s earlier suggestion that the US wouldn’t defend Nato allies under attack unless they paid their fair share in defence spending.The US contributes around 70 per cent of Nato’s total defence spending and while Mr Trump conceded that the alliance was still “very important” to him, the Republican blasted other members that do not contribute enough.

    At the moment just the US, Britain, Greece, Poland and Estonia are spending the minimum target of two per cent of their GDP on defence, despite a commitment in 2014 from all 28 Nato members to reach the two per cent spending target by 2024.Speaking alongside Mr Stoltenberg, the President said: “If other countries pay their fair share instead of relying on the United States to make up the difference, we will all be much more secure, and our partnership will be made that much stronger.  GETTYThe pair gave a joint press conference after their meeting“The secretary general and I had a productive discussion about what more NATO can do in the fight against terrorism.“I complained about that a long time ago and they made a change, and now they do fight terrorism.”After a busy week for President Trump there were a number of questions about the US’s future foreign relations, particularly regarding Russia and North Korea.Mr Trump vowed to take on North Korea without China’s help if necessary as tensions between the hermit state and the international community continue to escalate.He said: "President Xi wants to do the right thing. We had a very good bonding, I think we had a very good chemistry together, I think he wants to help us with North Korea."We talked trade, we talked a lot of things, and I said the way you’re going to make a good trade deal is to help us with North Korea, otherwise we’re just going to go it alone, that’ll be all right too, but going it alone means going with lots of other nations."Mr Trump also discussed US-Russia relations after last week’s missile strike in Syria, and the President said ties were at an “all time low”.

The US is a very strong country."We are going to see how that all works out."
