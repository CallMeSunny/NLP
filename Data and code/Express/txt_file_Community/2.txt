   Authorities have imposed an effective ban Christian gatherings and police are requiring Christians to report where they are going every time they leave their homes in the Henan Province.Worshippers have been placed under house arrest with Christians afraid to attend church groups amid fears the crackdown is worsening. An anonymous source said it feels like the Cultural Revolution all over again.They said: “I heard that many churches in Sheqi County also received notice that all believers cannot gather anymore.

China sends 100 Christians to ‘re-education’ camps  “Christians are afraid of gathering and they don’t have anywhere to gather either. “Times have changed. It feels like the Cultural Revolution.”These shocking claims come from the US-based group ChinaAid, which reports religious persecution.The Cultural Revolution was between 1966 and 1976 when Mao Zedong tried to enforce atheism as the official religious belief of the Communist Party and sought to eradicate all influences besides Communism.   AFPThe Chinese government is cracking down on Churches in the Communist stateChurches in Gushi County have also reportedly been notified about the banning of religious activities.In the nearby Tanghe County authorities have told house churches to register with the government operated Three-Self Church and those who attend a house church will be fined £3,349.Earlier this month a Chinese priest shared a video of authorities tearing down crosses from a local Catholic Church in Henan during a major raid. The cathedral was sanctioned by the government and it was reported that this was the first time crosses were removed from a Catholic church in that area.  GETTYChristians in China's Henan Province have reportedly been put on house arrestChinaAid President Bob Fu told The Christian Post: “The top leadership is increasingly worried about the rapid growth of the Christian faith and their public presence, and their social influence.“It is a political fear for the Communist Party, as the number Christians in the country far outnumber the members of the party.”In February Express.co.uk reported more than 100 Christians were sent to “re-education” camps where they were believed to be taught to be loyal to the country’s ideologies.These so-called “mind-transformation centres” instructed detainees to be loyal to China and not their religion, according to persecution watchdog Open Doors.   GETTYA deal has yet to be struck between the Vatican and the Chinese governmentThe Chinese Communist Party has launched a major crackdown on religion in recent years in an attempt to oppress religious freedom and exercise control.Churches not sanctioned by the government have been put under surveillance with hundreds of Christians arrested for disturbing public order for offences such as holding bible study groups and displaying crucifixes outside their homes. There have been reports of Christians being banned from praying, singing hymns, crosses removed from buildings and people arrested for attending church services.The dialogue continues between The Vatican and China on reaching a deal that would lead to diplomats relations between the Holy See and Beijing.    A statement followed reports in China quoting a bishop backed by the Beijing government as saying that a long-awaited deal would be signed by the end of March.A senior Vatican source said earlier on Thursday that the Vatican still did not know precisely when a Chinese delegation was due to come to Rome.Catholics in China are split between those in "underground" communities that recognise the pope and those belonging to a state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association where bishops are appointed by the government in collaboration with local Church communities. Under the formal deal, the Vatican will have a say in negotiations for the appointment of future bishops.Some Catholic leaders outside China, particularly Cardinal Joseph Zen, 86, the outspoken former bishop of Hong Kong, has been highly critical of the accord, saying the Vatican would be "selling out" to China's Communist Party.
