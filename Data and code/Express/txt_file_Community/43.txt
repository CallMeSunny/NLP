    Why is Earth Hour celebrated?The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) set up the event as sign of their commitment to environmental protection.The WWF encourages people, governments and organisations to take part in order to a strong message about climate change.   GETTYSome experts however have criticised Earth Hour for not having an impactSiddarth Das, executive director of Earth Hour Global, said: “We started Earth Hour in 2007 to show leaders that climate change was an issue people cared about. We started Earth Hour in 2007 to show leaders that climate change was an issue people cared aboutSiddarth Das, Earth Hour Global“For that symbolic moment to turn into the global movement it is today, is really humbling and speaks volumes about the powerful role of people in issues that affect their lives.”He added: “Our actions today will define tomorrow - WWF’s Earth Hour shows us that together we can create the sustainable future we desire, and our children deserve.”But not everyone is supportive of Earth Hour, with many calling it a meaningless gesture.  GETTYOver 170 countries took part in Earth Hour last yearBjørn Lomborg, an adjunct professor at the Copenhagen Business School, noted the drop in electricity usage is overtaken by a spike in gas and coal station output."The organizers say that they are providing a way to demonstrate one’s desire to “do something” about global warming. But the reality is that Earth Hour teaches all the wrong lessens, and it actually increases CO2 emissions,” he wrote in a commentary for Project Syndicate. "During Earth Hour, any significant drop in electricity demand will entail a reduction in CO2 emissions during the hour, but it will be offset by the surge from firing up coal or gas stations to restore electricity supplies afterward."The professor claimed that the entire world turning off its lights would only be equivalent to China stopping its CO2 emissions for four minutes.
