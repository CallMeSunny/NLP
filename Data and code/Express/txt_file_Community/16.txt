    “It’s a new way of communicating. We can expect to have more periodic product drops that would be more exciting, and sometimes unexpected by consumers.”Marco Gobbetti, Burberry’s chief executive, said: “While we know it will take time to achieve our ambitions, our progress to date and the energy in and around the company give me confidence for the future.”Shares fell 85p to 2016p.
