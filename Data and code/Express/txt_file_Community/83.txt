  EXPRESS NEWSPAPERS Express.co.uk brings you all the biggest technology stories from the last week So, it turns out the Apple Watch is a $1billion success Who knew?Apple has hinted its two-and-a-bit-month-old Apple Watch is already a $1billion business.Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts the possibilities for the firm's Apple Watch were "enormous".He also hinted that the Apple Watch was a business worth more than $1billion – despite only being on-sale in nine countries for some 90 days.Apple Watch has also had a more successful launch than either the hugely popular iPhone and iPad, Mr Cook hinted.  GETTYApple CEO Tim Cook shows off his Apple Watch Sport to customers within the Apple StoreThe news comes days after a technology research firm revealed Apple Watch owners were more satisfied with the device than those who bought a first-generation iPhone and iPad.Speaking during the Q&A session at the end of the third quarter results, CEO Tim Cook told analysts: "Sales of the Watch did exceed our expectations and they did so despite supply still trailing demand at the end of the quarter."To give you a little additional insight, through the end of the quarter, in fact, the Apple Watch sell-through was higher than the comparable launch periods of the original iPhone or the original iPad."Now, our objective of the quarter wasn’t primarily sales but also how we position the product in the long term because we are starting a new product category. "And as I back up and look at this, with 8,500 apps, we’ve already announced the next watchOS 2 — It will bring native apps, which will be killer. "Even though the store layout was delayed, we’ve learned a lot about the buying experience. "We plan to expand channel before the holiday because we’re convinced that the watch will be one of the top gifts of the holiday."I know I never go anywhere without the Watch. And it’s not because I’m the CEO of Apple, I’m that attached to it. "I get a lot of notes from a lot of people that feel the same way. And so that’s how I look at the Watch."  APPLEhose who want to replace their credit card with an Apple device need an iPhone 6, 6 Plus or Watch Apple is not planning to break out individual Apple Watch figures any time soon, however Tim Cook's comments seem to hint that earlier reports of Apple Watch orders dropping 90 per cent were inaccurate. Instead the firm's first wearable is being included in the Other category in its report.This category also includes sales of the Apple TV, iPod, Beats Electronics, Apple accessories and cases and Apple Watch.During its latest quarter, the Cupertino company reported an increase of revenue to $2.6 billion – up some 56 per cent sequentially.However this growth cannot be solely attributed to the Apple Watch, since other products within the category could have grown or dropped within the same three-month period.CEO Tim Cook himself hinted that the Apple Watch generated more revenue than the 56 per cent – or $1billion – increase."If you look at Other products category, and look at the revenue in here, it would not be an accurate thing to just look at the sequential change, or the year over year change and assume that was just Watch revenue," he told analysts yesterday."Because the aggregate balance of that category, both sequentially and year-over-year, is shrinking. "Obviously the iPod is part of that but there are other things in there, accessories and so forth, that are shrinking."Read MoreBritons' DIRTIEST secrets EXPOSED: Hackers threaten to LEAK Ashley Madison cheaters onlineHacking organisation The Impact Team has threatened to expose private data from cheating spouses website AshleyMadison.com including the names, credit card information, nude photographs and adulterous sexual fantasies of its 37 MILLION users.AshleyMadison – an online dating service for people seeking extramarital affairs – boasts more than 1.2 million British users.The salacious social network, which sells itself with the tagline “Life Is Short. Have An Affair”, has been hacked by an online group dubbed The Impact Team.  IGThe homepage for AshleyMadison, an online dating website for those looking for extra-martial affairsThe hackers are demanding AshleyMadison.com and its sister website be shutdown.If their demands are not met, the cybercriminals have threatened to leak the websites' 37 million users' most intimate details including names, ages, addresses, credit card information, nude pictures and sexual fantasies.A small sample of the extremely damaging data was posted online by the group along with a statement addressed to Avid Life Media, the Canadian parent company that owns AshleyMadison.The Impact Team has demanded AshleyMadison and Established Men, another dating site owned by Avid Life Media, be completely removed from the internet.The stolen database could expose the identities of millions of adulterers across the globe.Writing in the public statement to Avid Life Media, the hackers claim they were spurred to action over the website's Full Delete feature.The £15 service promises to completely erase any information associated with a user's AshleyMadison profile.However the hackers claim AshleyMadison has been secretly storing credit card details — including real name and billing addresses — of all its users, including those who have paid for the Full Delete feature."Full Delete netted ALM $1.7mm in revenue in 2014. It’s also a complete lie,” the hacking group wrote in their online statement. “Users almost always pay with credit card; their purchase details are not removed as promised, and include real name and address, which is of course the most important information the users want removed.”  AVID LIFEAvid Life Media CEO Noel Biderman, whose firm runs AshleyMadison, Cougar Life and Established Men AshleyMadison has denied the hackers' claim.A spokesperson told Express.co.uk: "The "paid-delete" option offered by AshleyMadison.com removes all information related to a member's profile and communications activity. "The process involves a hard-delete of a requesting user's profile, including the removal of posted pictures and all messages sent to other system users' email boxes."As our customers' privacy is of the utmost concern to us, we are now offering our full-delete option free to any member, in light of today's news."Read MoreSpotify's new feature wants to work out your new favourite artistsSpotify wants to introduce you to your new favourite band with its new feature Discover Weekly.Spotify has rolled out a new feature – called Discover Weekly – to its 75 million users across the globe.

GETTYThe contactless payment card limit is set to increase from £20 to £30All ten credit and debit cards tested revealed some data using the hack.But while none gave up the three-digit CVV security code on the back of the card, one online store allowed the team to order a £3,000 TV with the incomplete data gathered. Contactless cards are supposed to mask personal data during a purchase – however, the technology clearly has flaws, a Which? spokesperson added.The news comes weeks after Apple launched its contactless payment solution Apple Pay across the UK.Apple Pay allows iPhone and Apple Watch owners to use their Apple-branded gadgets to pay at checkout instead of using a contactless payment card.The iPhone manufacturer has claimed its Apple Pay solution is more secure than contactless cards, since all transactions made in-store with the iPhone are secured by a fingerprint.Apple Pay will never reveal your card number or details to the merchant when you pay – making it more privacy-focused than current payment systems, Apple has claimed.  APPLEApple believes its the fingerprint sensor in its Apple Pay system is MORE secure than contactless Instead of the details on your credit or debit card, which are revealed when using contactless or chip-and-pin, Apple creates an entirely new “Unique Device Account Number”.In theory, the "transaction-specific dynamic security code" should prevent card details being cloned.Contactless payment continues to grow rapidly in popularity, with more than 2 billion spent through the system last year, according to the UK Cards Association.Speaking about the Which? experiment, a spokesperson said: "Contactless cards are coded to 'mask' personal data, but using an easily obtainable reader and free software to decode data, we were able to read the card number and expiry date from all 10 cards."We were also able to read limited details of the last 10 transactions, although no cards revealed the CVV security code (the number on the back)."We doubted we'd be able to make purchases without the cardholder's name or CVV code - but we were wrong."We ordered two items - one a £3,000 TV - from a mainstream online shop using 'stolen' card details, combined with a false name and address."Read More Apple iPhone 6S to drop 16GB storage optionThe iPhone 6S could be the first Apple smartphone to drop the 16GB internal storage configuration, according to a leak from the Cupertino firm's supply chain.Apple is reportedly dropping the 16GB internal storage configuration for its next iPhone model.The next-generation smartphone – which is expected to be named either iPhone 6S or iPhone 7 – will replace the current 16GB base model with 32GB of internal storage.  FUTURE SUPPLIER • IGThe "smoother" and "stronger" iPhone 6 Plus case leaked by Future Supplier Apple has been working hard to ensure those with limited internal storage will be able to update to the latest version of its mobile operating system, iOS.Sources within Apple’s Taiwan-based manufacturing partner Foxconn claim the packaging being prepared for the new iPhone does not include boxes for a 16GB model.iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus will reportedly only ship in 32GB, 64GB and 128GB configurations."We can’t tell you [what Foxconn] department we received information [from], but we can [say] that the packaging of the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus [do not] have [stickers] with ’16GB capacity," wrote Chan Zhuang of Made In China Gadget.Apple has reportedly dropped Samsung as a supplier for its internal storage after the Korean firm increased its prices.This price hike is rumoured to be why Apple did not drop the 16GB configuration before the launch of the iPhone 6, back in September 2014.  APPLEApple debuted its pressure sensitive ForceTouch display technology in the Apple Watch However Apple Senior Vice President of Marketing Phil Schiller defended the Cupertino firm's decision to launch a 16GB base model, stating that iCloud makes up for the lack of on-board storage."The belief is more and more as we use iCloud services for documents and our photos and videos and music, that perhaps the most price-conscious customers are able to live in an environment where they don’t need lots of local storage because these services are lightening the load," Mr Schiller said in an interview with John Gruber, of Daring Fireball.Apple is also rumoured to be using a stronger case for the iPhone 6S in an effort to avoid the same bendgate controversy that hit the iPhone 6 Plus last year.The successor to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will hit UK stores on September 24th – a date confirmed by a recent Vodafone leak.Apple is expected to include the Force Touch technology it debuted in the Apple Watch earlier this year.Force Touch would allow the iPhone to distinguish between a light tap and a harder press on the display.The subtle feature is used on the Apple Watch to hide menu items.Industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, of KGI Securities, believes Force Touch will be the single biggest selling point for the new Apple smartphone, which is also rumoured to sport an updated camera and 2GB of RAM.“Force Touch can enrich user experience due to more input methods and support of handwritten signatures, which is beneficial for expanding the commercial market,” Mr Kuo has claimed.

Apple is also reportedly plotting to brighten up its iPhone range with a new colour.The next generation Apple smartphone will reportedly ship with a light pink aluminium option. Apple currently offers three choices of colour of the hugely successful iPhone range, including Silver, Gold and Space Grey.The Cupertino company was rumoured to be developing a rose gold version of the iPhone 6S handset – similar to the colour of the Apple Watch.However – the firm is now believed to have scrapped the rose gold option in favour of a faint aluminium pink variation with a white face.Read MoreMicrosoft rushes emergency Windows security fix after one BILLION PCs left open to HACKERSWindows users have been told to download a security patch IMMEDIATELY following the discovery of a "critical" security flaw which has left one BILLION PC owners vulnerable.Microsoft has rolled out an emergency patch for a "critical" bug found in almost every version of Windows, including the upcoming Windows 10.The flaw, which has been categorised as "critical" - Microsoft's highest level of threat – affects two thirds of all 1.5 billion Personal Computers running Windows across the globe.Exploiting the Windows vulnerability hackers could take "complete control of the affected system", Microsoft posted in an online security bulletin this week.  GETTY • MICROSOFT The critical security flaw even affects Windows 10, which is still weeks away from release The firm added: "An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights."Windows users can be attacked by booby-trapped websites using exploit code or by email attachments. The flaw affects anyone running Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and 8.1, Server 2008, Server 2012 and Windows RT.Google security researchers, from the Project Zero security squad, have been credited with identifying and reporting the "critical" flaw.Microsoft has confirmed the bug has been talked about online but revealed it had no evidence "to indicate this vulnerability had been used to attack customers".The firm said the majority of the 1.5 billion PC customers running Windows will have automatic updates enabled – and therefore will not need to take action to protect their computer.Instead, the Microsoft security patch has likely already been installed.However those who have opted-out of automatic Windows updates should download the patch from the firm's security bulletin immediately here.The critical flaw has come at a bad time for Microsoft, which is weeks away from the release of its next generation operating system.Windows 10 – the final version of Windows – will be rolled out across the globe later this month.The new Microsoft operating system, which sees the return of the Start Menu, is available as a free upgrade for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users.Microsoft confirmed this week that Windows 10 will get security patches and updates for the next decade.
