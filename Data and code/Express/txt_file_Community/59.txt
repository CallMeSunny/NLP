  Ed Balls said Labour would introduce spending cuts if in powerSpeaking at Labour's annual conference in Brighton, Mr Balls warned delegates if Labour does return to power in three years, it will have to show "iron discipline" on tax and spending.Mr Balls also vowed there would be "no more borrowing for day-to-day spending", with any changes to the current Government's spending plans for 2015/16 set out prior to the election."We won't be able to reverse all the spending cuts and tax rises the Tories have pushed through," said Mr Balls."And we will have to govern with less money around. The next Labour government will have to make cuts too."Mr Balls also appeared to signal a significant weakening in Labour support for the High Speed 2 project to build a new rail link between London, the Midlands and the north of England, suggesting that the potential £50 billion price-tag might be better spent elsewhere.Repeating his line that, as chancellor, he would not offer a "blank cheque" to HS2, he added: "The question is - not just whether a new high speed line is a good idea or a bad idea, but whether it is the best way to spend £50 billion for the future of our country."Ed Balls vowed to keep the benefits cap And we will have to govern with less money around. The next Labour government will have to make cuts too.Ed BallsAt a conference which has been overshadowed by reports of feuding between Labour's last generation of leaders, Mr Balls sought to scotch speculation about tension with Ed Miliband by describing the leader as "my friend, our leader, Britain's next prime minister" who was "leading from the front" on issues ranging from the economy to media regulation.By contrast, he said that Prime Minister David Cameron had "diminished Britain" by squandering influence overseas and choking off recovery at home.Mr Balls dismissed as "nonsense" Conservative claims of a £27.9 billion "black hole" in Labour's spending plans. And he announced that he will ask the Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog to audit Labour's manifesto to confirm that their tax and spend sums add up.He told activists: "The Government's day-to-day spending totals for 2015/16 will have to be our starting point. Any changes to the current spending plans for that year will be fully funded and set out in advance in our manifesto."There will be no more borrowing for day-to-day spending. And we will set out tough fiscal rules - to balance the current budget and get the national debt on a downward path."Of course Labour will always make different choices. We will combine iron discipline on spending control with a fairer approach to deficit reduction."An incoming Labour government would inherit "a very difficult situation" because of Mr Osborne's failure to eliminate the deficit, and would have to show "fiscal responsibility in the national interest", said Mr Balls."At a time when the public services that pensioners rely on are under such pressure, we cannot continue paying the winter fuel allowance to the richest 5% of pensioners," he said."We won't be able to reverse the Government's cuts to child benefit for the highest earners. We will keep the benefits cap, but make sure it properly reflects local housing costs. We will have a cap on structural social security spending."And yes, over the long-term, as our population ages, there will need to be increases in the retirement age."But he added: "A fairer approach to deficit reduction means we will also crack down on tax avoidance , scrap the shares for rights scheme and reverse the tax cut for hedge funds."And we will insist that all the proceeds from the sale of our stakes in Lloyds and RBS are used not for a one-off pre-election tax giveaway - but instead every penny of profit used to repay the national debt."Mr Balls said the banks paid a "staggering" £2.7 billion less in overall tax last year than they did in 2010, with the Government's bank levy raising £1.6 billion less than predicted over the past two years."At a time when resources are tight and families are under pressure that cannot be right, he said. "So I can announce today, the next Labour government will increase the bank levy rate to raise an extra £800 million a year."And we will use the money, for families where all parents are in work, to increase free childcare places for three and four-year-olds from 15 hours to 25 hours a week."Ed Balls praised Labour leader Ed Miliband in his speechMr Balls said that a Labour government would seek a "radical transformation in our economy" to enable the UK to exploit innovations in high-value manufacturing, digital media, education and medical technology.And he announced that Jaguar Land Rover executive director Mike Wright will lead a review for Labour on strengthening manufacturing supply-chains and delivering the skills and innovation Britain needs to succeed.He rejected coalition claims that the GDP growth recorded in the past few quarters showed that Chancellor George Osborne's economic strategy has worked and he was wrong to call for a "Plan B"."After three years of stagnation, it's good news that our economy has finally started to grow again," he said. "It was growing three years ago before they choked it off."So don't listen to the Tory propaganda that says Labour doesn't want the economy to grow. What nonsense. Because when the economy is in recession we know which communities lose out. When unemployment becomes entrenched, we know which constituencies suffer most. When the cost of living is rising, we know which families are hardest hit."We know that three years of flat lining - far longer than any of us expected - have caused long-term damage: businesses bankrupt, investment and capacity lost, long-term unemployment entrenched."And now even as growth finally returns, with prices still rising faster than wages, with business investment still weak, with unemployment still rising in half the country, with bank lending to business still falling, we can't be satisfied."For millions of families this is no recovery at all. And when around the world emerging markets are jittery, China is slowing, oil prices are rising and the eurozone is still stuck with chronic low growth, I say this is no time for complacency, to sit back with fingers crossed."Mr Balls warned that a recovery built on rising house prices may not be sustainable and launched a scathing attack on Mr Osborne's Help to Buy scheme to get first-time buyers onto the first rung of the property ladder."George, it's basic economics," he said. "If you push up housing demand, but don't act to boost housing supply, all that happens is that you push house prices up and up. And the end result is that the very people your policy should be helping - young first time buyers - will find it even harder to get on the housing ladder."That is why we have consistently said, it is why the IMF (International Monetary Fund) have said, bring forward £10 billion of infrastructure investment right now, build 400,000 affordable houses over the next two years, create half a million jobs and thousands of apprenticeships. That is the way to secure an economy that works for all and is built to last."Mr Balls' speech was met with a mixed response by business group the Institute of Directors.Director General Simon Walker said: "I remain concerned by Labour’s proposals to increase the minimum wage in specific sectors, and requiring firms to take on an apprentice for every non-EU worker they hire is a recipe for disaster."Having said that, Ed Balls engaged with several issues vital to business leaders in his speech. "We share his concerns about the extended Help to Buy scheme, which risks pushing up house prices while doing little to increase the supply of homes. "Planning reform is the vital missing element here. There are still too many flaws in the system that hold up home-building. "It was also significant that he questioned whether HS2 was the best way to spend £50bn. The IoD agrees with Labour that infrastructure investment is essential, but governments must be clear that they are getting value for money.  “Mr Balls’ commitment to discipline in the public finances is welcome, but will require Labour to clamp down on additional spending pledges. "Their rhetoric must be matched by actions. He should be very wary of attempting to achieve deficit reduction through tax rises, which would be deeply damaging to the recovery.” Related articles   Labour to boost childcare allowance   Balls denies MMR benefit cut report   'Ban tobacco companies from Labour conference' urges Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham
