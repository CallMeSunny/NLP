Monday May 12.00pm BST: North Korea has issued a chilling warning to the West that it will carry out a nuclear test “at any time and at any location” set by despot leader Kim Jong-un, in the state’s latest warmongering rhetoric.In a statement carried on the state-run KCNA news agency, a spokesman for the regime confirmed it will continue to bolster its "preemptive nuclear attack" capabilities unless Washington scrapped its “hostile” policies.He added: "The DPRK's measures for bolstering the nuclear force to the maximum will be taken in a consecutive and successive way at any moment and any place decided by its supreme leadership,” apparently referring to a sixth nuclear test and using the North's official name, the Democratic Republic of Korea.10.45am BST: Donald Trump’s national security adviser has reiterated the President’s warning that the US must be “prepared” for military action against North Korea.Lieutenant General HR McMaster said that while Mr Trump’s administration would rather “work with others” to resolve the issue “short of military action”, it must be prepared to take action to prevent Kim Jong-un from building a cache of nuclear weapons.“North Korea poses a grave threat to the United States, our great allies in the region, South Korea and Japan ... but also to China and others. And so it's important, I think, for all of us to confront this regime,” he said during an interview with Fox News.“This regime that is pursuing the weaponisation of a missile with a nuclear weapon. And so this is something that we know we cannot tolerate ... The President has made clear that he is going to resolve this issue one way or another.“It may mean ratcheting up those sanctions even further and it also means being prepared for military operations if necessary."2:55am BST: Donald Trump has warned that the US cannot allow Kim Jong-un to have a better missile arsenal as tensions continue to escalate between the two nations.Despite overseeing a failed missile blast on Saturday, President Trump said Kim Jong-un is a "pretty smart cookie" who will eventually build a better delivery system.The former business tycoon said: “People are saying, ‘Is he sane?’ I have no idea.“But we have a situation that we just cannot let – we cannot let what's been going on for a long period of years continue."

I don't think humanity today could bear it.”He added: “I think the United Nations has the duty to resume its leadership, because it has been watered down a bit.”Noon BST: A former North Korean female concentration camp guard has revealed the horrors of the communist regime.Lim Hye-jin told the Mail on Sunday she was forced to watch two brothers get beheaded as punishment for trying to escape the camp.At the age of 17, the young woman was sent to Camp 12, a work camp for North Korean dissidents close to the Chinese border.“We were manipulated not to feel any sympathy for prisoners,' she told the Mail. 'We were told they had committed terrible crimes. “Now I know they were normal people so I feel very guilty.”4.30am BST: In his first TV interview since the failed missile test, Trump refused to deny that the US would take the possibility of military conflict with North Korea off the table.When asked by CBS News if the US would take military action against North Korea in the event of another nuclear test, Trump said: 'I don't know. I mean, we'll see.'“[Kim] is going to have to do what he has to do. But he understands we're not going to be very happy. And I will tell you, a man that I've gotten to like and respect - the president of China, President Xi - I believe has been putting pressure on him also.“But so far, perhaps nothing's happened and perhaps it has. This was a small missile. This was not a big missile. This was not a nuclear test, which he was expected to do three days ago. We'll see what happens.'0.30am BST: Pope Francis has warned the world could be destroyed if a war between North Korea and the United States erupts.The leader of the Catholic Church said “humanity today would not be able to withstand” a potential war between the two countries as “everything” could be destroyed.“There are so many facilitators in the world, there are mediators who offer themselves, such as Norway for example.“It [Norway] is always ready to help. That is just one but there are many. But the path is the the of negotiations, of a diplomatic solution.“This question of missiles in [North] Korea has been brewing for more than a year but now it seems the situation has become too hot.“We are talking about the future of humanity. Today, a widespread war would destroy - I would not say half of humanity – but a good part of humanity, and of culture, everything, everything.“It would be terrible. I don’t think that humanity today would be able to withstand.” Inside North Korea: The pictures Kim Jong-un doesn't want you to see Thu, March 8, 2018Photographer Eric Lafforgue ventured to North Korea six times.

His father dies, took over a regime. So say what you want but that is not easy, especially at that age."I'm not giving him credit or not giving him credit, I'm just saying that's a very hard thing to do.

I hope he's rational.”12.30am BST: US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson claims Chinese officials have warned Kim Jong-un to halt nuclear tests.Mr Tillerson said: ”We were told by the Chinese that they informed the regime that if they did conduct further nuclear tests, China would be taking sanctions actions on their own.”  GETTYKim Jong-un and Donald TrumpThursday April 279pm BST: Now even Russian President Vladimir Putin is wading in to the situation.Following talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Moscow, Mr Putin said the pair believe the situation on the Korean peninsula has "seriously deteriorated".He said: "We call on all states involved in the region's affairs to refrain from military rhetoric and seek peaceful, constructive dialogue."The Russian leader said they spent a large chunk of their three-hour discussion talking about North Korea.He added six-party talks on North Korea involving Russia, Japan, China, the US and South Korea should be revived, with the possibility of new sanctions to be discussed.Mr Abe said Japan and Russia will continue to co-operate closely to urge North Korea to abide by UN Security Council resolutions and to abstain from "provocative actions".7.40pm BST: A top US military commander has warned North Korea will be capable of developing missiles that can strike America.Admiral Harry Harris told the House Armed Services Committee: “Just as Thomas Edison is believed to have failed 1,000 times before successfully inventing the light bulb, so, too, Kim Jong-un will keep trying. "One of these days soon, he will succeed."I don't share your confidence that North Korea is not going to attack either South Korea, or Japan, or the United States... once they have the capability."The commander also assured that a Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system was on schedule to be ready by next week.Any missile heading towards the US will be shot down in the sky before it reaches the US mainland. 3.30pm BST: North Korea has released a propaganda video showing a simulated attack on the White House.The erratic clip uses pictures of Donald Trump’s residence and declares that “the enemy to be destroyed is in our sights”.It also sees missiles firing, and navy ships seen through a sniper’s crosshair.1.00pm BST: Boris Johnson has called for “calm, clear heads” in the stand-off with North Korea, insisting that military action against Pyongyang is “not the way forward”.Speaking to BBC One's Breakfast, Mr Johnson said the threat from North Korea was “very real and very dangerous indeed” and the White House was “entirely right” to escalate the issue. But he warned that military action could result in “huge and hideous reprisals” against the South and insisted it was not “likely” at this point. Meanwhile, Kim Jong-un has claimed that North Korea loves peace “more than anyone else”.A Pyongyang mouthpiece said:  “As a peace-loving socialist state, the DPRK values and loves peace more than anyone else.“The US and the puppet forces are a kingpin seriously threatening and harassing the peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and the region.
