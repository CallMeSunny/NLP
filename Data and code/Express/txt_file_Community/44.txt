   LOON PROJECT, Google’s ambitious attempt to introduce the internet around the world, is embarking on a new chapter, using low Earth orbit technology. So what exactly is Google Loon?

We decided that we needed to seek collaborationLoon CEO Alastair WestgarthGoogle's Loon Project is a network of high-altitude helium balloons, delivering internet access to those in underserved communities around the world.And in a strategic twist, the Alphabet-owned company have announced Loon’s software will now control a new fleet of low Earth-orbiting satellites, in an attempt to finally realise their ambitious mission objectives.Project Loon last week announced an arrangement with its former rival, Canadian telecommunications company Telesat.READ MORE: Mars MYSTERY: NASA probes strange impact crater on red planet  Loon Project: Alphabet software will now control a new fleet of low Earth-orbiting satellites (Image: Alphabet)  Loon Project: Billions of people around the world remain without internet access (Image: Alphabet)The deal will see Google’s custom software for managing its Loon balloon fleet control Telesat’s new fleet of low Earth orbit satellites.The partnership follows Project Loon’s acknowledgement their plan for worldwide internet access will not alone achieve its aim.Loon CEO Alastair Westgarth explained the project has learned solving the logistical difficulties required collaboration, not just better technology.He said: “The opportunity is bigger than any one of us.READ MORE: Was Einstein WRONG?
