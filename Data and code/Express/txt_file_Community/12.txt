    var brightcoveBrandsafety='' Former US Homeland Security advisor Tom Bossert issued grave warnings on BBC’s Today programme this morning. He explained: “Some are concerned that Huawei represents a future espionage risk. That there’ll be theft of future information or a future sabotage risk - that your telecommunications in the future might be rendered unavailable because of some Chinese knowledge of their vulnerabilities.” Related articles   P30 Pro could be troubled as new Huawei rival revealed TOMORROW   South China Sea: Trump ‘SCARED’ of triggering war with China - Duterte BBC host Martha Kearney nervously interjected: “Is this about the risk of the Chinese state spying through a role in our infrastructure or just about the prominence of Chinese technology in a core area like this?”Mr Bossert replied: “I’m worried abut three things in the following order:“The first concern is about the reliability caused by some affirmative action on the Chinese part to take down some component or to sabotage some component of your telecommunications.“The second is that future decision to steal some our information, which I think we can mitigate to some extent.

A spokeswoman said: "We don't comment on NSC discussions."The decision came after a number of senior security figures warned publicly of the risks entailed in allowing a Chinese firm access to the UK's critical communications network.MI6 chief Alex Younger has said Britain needs to decide how "comfortable" it is in allowing Chinese firms to become involved, while the head of GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, has spoken of both "opportunities and threats" which they present.Some critics have expressed concerns that the Chinese government could require the firm to install technological "back doors" to enable it spy on or disable Britain's communications network.Last month a Government-led committee set up to vet Huawei's products said it had found "significant technological issues" with its engineering processes leading to new risks to the UK network.
