Bruno suffered with mental health problems after he retired from boxing, butÂ claimed in July that he has been "medication-free" for three years.
Speaking after he picked up his award, the former WBC heavyweight champion said: "This honour, I would like to think, its not only for my achievements in boxing.
"But also in recognition of the work and the constant battle I'm trying to fight on behalf of the sufferers and carers of sufferers who have experienced this terrible curse of mental health.
"I am honoured more than I can truly express in these few words and I thank the people that put me forward and voted for me to get this honour."

Professor John Vinney of the Bournemouth University said: "I am always delighted to welcome our Honorary Graduates to our BU community.
"It is great that we can take time each year to recognise people who have excelled in their chosen field and who have worked closely with us already.
"They will act as inspirational role models, both for our graduates and their families at the awards ceremonies.
"And they will continue to enrich our community as they partner with BU in the future too."
