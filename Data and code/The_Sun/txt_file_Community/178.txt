LAUREN Goodger has revealed herself to be a bad girlfriend after claiming that her 'jailbird boyfriend' paid for his own £500 Christmas present.
Today we revealed that the Towie star had bragged on Instagram about purchasing flashy Chanel trainers for Joey Morrison, the handsome criminal she's hoping to start a family with.

But this afternoon she took to Twitter to claim that the 30-year-old - banged up for 17 years for a string of violent offences - funded the smart shoes himself.
She told fans: "All this speculation😴No I didn't buy Joey Chanel trainers, he bought he's own pairs& I wanted a pair& finally found them and bought them❤."
It's possible that he DID buy them himself - if not with money he had saved up before being sent to prison in 2010 then using money he's earned while inside.
Standford Hill, where he is currently serving his sentence, does allow inmates to work and earn cash to spend in the canteen and to save up for when they leave.

The prison's website states: "The main focus for Standford Hill is for prisoners to work out in the community, carrying out reparative work or engaging in paid employment towards the end of their sentence.
"Within the prison there is an education department offering a full range of learning and numerous vocational training opportunities.

"Much of the employment throughout the prison involves peer advisors and embeds learning where ever possible."
Regardless of how Joey funded the coveted footwear, her explanation is slightly different to the romantic shoe-based post she put on social media a few hours ago.

Lauren posted a picture of fancy trainers, which match a pair she owns, on Instagram with the caption: “His and hers”.
Joey’s sister later jokingly commented: “What about the sis in law?”
On Tuesday Lauren revealed her heartbreak at being unable to spend Christmas with Joey at HMP Stanford Hill.
She told Closer Magazine: “I really wanted to see him over the Christmas Day but sadly the prison is closed.
“I wanted to take him a Christmas meal but I’m not allowed to.
“I’ve already sent him trainers and tracksuits – but that’s all I can send!”
Police4 Joey is serving 18 years for a string of offences including drug-dealing and ABH
Lauren doesn’t call Joey her boyfriend but she’s made her feelings about him clear.
The pair have known each other for nine years and Towie favourite Lauren feels the public don’t understand their relationship.

She told Closer Magazine: “It’s really narrow-minded that people see him as a criminal.
“Yes, he’s not been an angel but people deserve a second chance and his crimes never involved innocent people.”
Lauren’s looking to the future now and adds: “He’s done half his time and he should be out in a couple of months.
“I can’t wait! I’m going to hold a party for him, his family and our mutual friends.”
It seems starting a family is very much in her plans, with broody Lauren saying “I’ll have [a baby] next year” before admitting she’d love to have two children.
She added: “I’m so excited about having a baby. There will be a LG range and everything.”

In September it was revealed that Lauren  was permitted to spend time with the Essex convict in the open prison’s “informal environment” and the pair are said to have been getting rather cosy.
A source said: “I’ve seen Lauren there ­visiting Joey a couple of times and they look ­incredibly close.
“Joey’s been a bad lad over the years but he’s got links to Essex so she’s probably known him some time.
They added to the Sunday People: “They look every bit like a couple and that’s what everyone in the prison thinks is going on.”
