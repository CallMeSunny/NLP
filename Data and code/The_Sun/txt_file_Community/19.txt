The royal women pulled out all the stops for the Westminster event, with Meghan, 37, in an eye-catching white chain-print Victoria Beckham dress, coat, bag and shoes while Kate, also 37, wore a favourite Catherine Walker coat and matching dress.
It had been rumoured the pair had previously clashed - with the Duchess of Cambridge reportedly brought to tears during Meghan's wedding preparations.
But the rift speculation was put behind them as the Fab Four was reunited and all smiles for the event.
Pregnant Meghan especially seemed in good spirits despite it being a long day for the former actress.
Just hours earlier she visited youngsters at Canada House in an embellished green coat by Canadian and Turkish fashion designer Erdem Moralioglu along with £486 Aquazzura pumps.
Meanwhile, the 92-year-old Queen wore purple for the event at Westminster Abbey this afternoon.
Other guests among the 2,000-strong congregation included Prime Minister Theresa May and the Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness Scotland.
High commissioners, ambassadors, faith leaders and more than 800 schoolchildren and young people also attended.
And Prince William appeared to particularly enjoy the afternoon service - smiling to himself as internationally-acclaimed didgeridoo player William Barton played the traditional Australian instrument.
Guests were also treated to singer Alfie Boe perform a cover of Snow Patrol's Run.

SECOND HOME
It comes after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex made a separate visit to Canada House to mark Commonwealth Day this morning.
The visit to Canada House was sure to be special for Meghan, who previously lived in Toronto for six years while filming the popular TV show Suits.
The former actress, who made her name in the show as paralegal Rachel, previously described Canada as her "second home".
And the future parents were delighted as they were presented with a sweet baby onesie decorated with a maple leaf and tiny moccasins.
They also got the chance to meet some young Canadians living in the UK, including nine-year-old Asya Karkaria, from Ottawa, who managed a sweet curtsy.
Meanwhile eight-year-old Michael McCarthy, also from Ottawa, got a handshake from Prince Harry.
It's an exciting time for the couple, who will welcome their first child together in a matter of weeks.
But despite getting ever closer to her due date, Meghan has shown no signs of slowing down - attending a string of royal engagements in the past few weeks.

This morning's event at Canada House in Trafalgar Square showcased the diverse community of young Canadians living in the UK, with the royal couple speaking to those working in fashion, tech entrepreneurship, business and the arts.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex even got the chance to make maple taffy - maple syrup cooled on snow to make sweets - during the visit.
And Meghan was left astounded when one little boy declared he had eaten seven of the sweets, replying: "Seven? Oh my goodness."
Canadian high commissioner Janice Charette said she had dropped hints about the couple visiting Canada, telling Meghan: "We do kind of claim you".
Meghan laughed, replying: "I’ll take that!"
She fondly reminisced about her time in Toronto, saying "it's such a great place" as she asked the young people where they were from in the city.
Harry, 34, and Meghan have spearheaded the Queen's Commonwealth duties after being made President and Vice President of Her Majesty's Commonwealth Trust.
DRAWN TOGETHER
The Queen today praised how millions of people are "drawn together" because of the collective values shared by the institution.
In a written address to the 53 countries of the Commonwealth, the Queen said: "In April last year, I welcomed the leaders of our 53 nations to Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, and we all witnessed how the Commonwealth vision offers hope, and inspires us to find ways of protecting our planet, and our people.
"We are able to look to the future with greater confidence and optimism as a result of the links that we share, and thanks to the networks of co-operation and mutual support to which we contribute, and on which we draw.
"With enduring commitment through times of great change, successive generations have demonstrated that whilst the goodwill for which the Commonwealth is renowned may be intangible, its impact is very real."

Commonwealth Day has a special significance this year, as 2019 marks the 70th anniversary of the modern Commonwealth - a global network of 53 countries and almost 2.4 billion people.
The theme for this year's service is "A Connected Commonwealth" which highlights the co-operation between the culturally diverse family of nations who work together in friendship.
Later in the evening, Charles and Camilla will be guests of the Commonwealth Secretary-General at the annual reception which traditionally takes place on Commonwealth Day at Marlborough House, the home of the Commonwealth Secretariat, the institution's civil service.
