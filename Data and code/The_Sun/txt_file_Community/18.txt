ALL eyes were on Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton as they arrived at Westminster Abbey for a Commonwealth Day service yesterday afternoon.
The two Duchesses appeared delighted to see each other as they kissed warmly on both cheeks - and now body language expert Judi James claims their rumoured 'rift' could finally be over.

Speaking exclusively to Fabulous Online, Judi said: "It was clear Kate and Meghan were keen to signal bonds of warm friendship yesterday, rather than the either distant or over-congruent displays from the last couple of outings."
After Meghan appeared "isolated" and "shy" at a Buckingham Palace event with the rest of the Royal Family last week, Judi noted a marked change in the Duchess of Sussex's body language.
She added: "Kate appeared to be the one making active moves - as she did on Christmas Day - although Meghan provided a response of delight and good humour.
"These four have lacked the spark of fun the two men in particular were always famous for but Meghan seemed to be the one trying to re-ignite that spark with some wide, authentic looking grins and animated body language."

Meanwhile, Prince Harry and Prince William "adopted more straight-faced roles" during the interaction.
Judi added: "Their fig-leaf poses suggested a need to be guarded or self-protective and it was the wives talking and laughing across them while they appeared stern at times."
Likening Kate and Meghan's greeting to a "true fashionista air-kiss" that even "Patsy and Edwina [of Absolutely Fabulous] would be proud of", the body language expert concluded: "Meghan's smile suggested genuine pleasure as Kate leaned in to kiss her."
Additionally, "Meghan's hand on Kate's arm involved a ballerina gesture" which was "elegant but not quite clasping".

The royal women pulled out all the stops for the Westminster event yesterday, with Meghan, 37, in an eye-catching white chain-print Victoria Beckham dress, coat, bag and shoes while Kate, also 37, wore a favourite Catherine Walker coat and matching dress.
It had been rumoured the pair had previously clashed - with the Duchess of Cambridge reportedly brought to tears during Meghan's wedding preparations.
Pregnant Meghan especially seemed in good spirits despite it having been a long day for the former actress - just hours before having visited youngsters at Canada House in an embellished green coat by Canadian and Turkish fashion designer Erdem Moralioglu along with £486 Aquazzura pumps.

Guests were also treated to singer Alfie Boe perform a cover of Snow Patrol's Run.

SECOND HOME
It comes after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex made a separate visit to Canada House to mark Commonwealth Day yesterday morning.
The visit to Canada House was sure to be special for Meghan, who previously lived in Toronto for six years while filming the popular TV show Suits.
The former actress, who made her name in the show as paralegal Rachel, previously described Canada as her "second home".
And the future parents were delighted as they were presented with a sweet baby onesie decorated with a maple leaf and tiny moccasins.
They also got the chance to meet some young Canadians living in the UK, including nine-year-old Asya Karkaria, from Ottawa, who managed a sweet curtsy.
Meanwhile eight-year-old Michael McCarthy, also from Ottawa, got a handshake from Prince Harry.
It's an exciting time for the couple, who will welcome their first child together in a matter of weeks.
But despite getting ever closer to her due date, Meghan has shown no signs of slowing down - attending a string of royal engagements in the past few weeks.

Monday morning's event at Canada House in Trafalgar Square showcased the diverse community of young Canadians living in the UK, with the royal couple speaking to those working in fashion, tech entrepreneurship, business and the arts.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex even got the chance to make maple taffy - maple syrup cooled on snow to make sweets - during the visit.
And Meghan was left astounded when one little boy declared he had eaten seven of the sweets, replying: "Seven? Oh my goodness."
Canadian high commissioner Janice Charette said she had dropped hints about the couple visiting Canada, telling Meghan: "We do kind of claim you".
Meghan laughed, replying: "I’ll take that!"
She fondly reminisced about her time in Toronto, saying "it's such a great place" as she asked the young people where they were from in the city.
Harry, 34, and Meghan have spearheaded the Queen's Commonwealth duties after being made President and Vice President of Her Majesty's Commonwealth Trust.
DRAWN TOGETHER
The Queen yesterday praised how millions of people are "drawn together" because of the collective values shared by the institution.
In a written address to the 53 countries of the Commonwealth, the Queen said: "In April last year, I welcomed the leaders of our 53 nations to Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, and we all witnessed how the Commonwealth vision offers hope, and inspires us to find ways of protecting our planet, and our people.
"We are able to look to the future with greater confidence and optimism as a result of the links that we share, and thanks to the networks of co-operation and mutual support to which we contribute, and on which we draw.
"With enduring commitment through times of great change, successive generations have demonstrated that whilst the goodwill for which the Commonwealth is renowned may be intangible, its impact is very real."
