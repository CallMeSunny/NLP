CATHERINE Tyldesley is set to enjoy a VERY sexy final Christmas on the Coronation Street cobbles as a bondage-clad REINDEER.
The actress, who plays cheeky barmaid Eva Price, is relishing her remaining scenes as the saucy blonde after she confirmed exclusively to The Sun she was calling it quits on the ITV soap.

The mum-of-one will leave the long-running show next summer.
Yet she is determined to heap a whole lot of sauce on her final festive period in Weatherfield.
Letting slip her Christmas plotline, she told The Star: “It’s so illegal! It’s a children’s nativity at a community centre, and I felt bad actually wearing that outfit in front of children!
"There’s nothing fluffy about it – it’s a bondage-y reindeer!"

Her jaw-dropping attire, which will remain under wraps until closer to the time, even causes Corrie vicar Billy Mayhew to make a comparison with raunchy Ann Summers lingerie.
Catherine, 34, added: “But it’s very funny – that’s the comic relief at Christmas.
“It’s great with vicar Billy’s reaction because he’s like: ‘Oh my God, this is for the kids and this is very Ann Summers.’”
Earlier this year, we reported how Eva - who was cheated on by factory boss Aidan Connor - revealed her "sexiest outfit yet" .

The Manchester lass shared a peek at her thigh-high boots, glittering fishnet stockings with a sheer miniskirt for upcoming scenes.
She wrote over the picture: “Just as you think Eva’s outfits can (sic) get anymore outrageous.”
Fortunately Catherine’s fully behind Eva’s choices out raunchy outfits as she picks out her character’s clobber.
Catherine told The Sun Online: “I choose all of Eva’s outfits.”

Meanwhile, the telly favourite told The Sun how she has quit the show in order to pursue other acting avenues - including serious dramas.
Catherine, 34, said: “Coronation Street has been a dream job for me which is why this was such a difficult decision to leave.
“Eva has been such fun to play over the last seven years, and who knows, one day she might storm the cobbles of Weatherfield again.

“In the meantime I’m excited about the future, new acting projects, and spending time with my family.”
Last week, she was spotted pulling a pint from behind another bar than the Rovers, namely Selfridges pop-up pub The Exchange Arms in Manchester, which is hosting its final event tonight.
