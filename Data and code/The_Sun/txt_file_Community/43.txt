THE Duchess of Cambridge made a sparkling entrance to a state banquet in Buckingham Palace last night as she wore a tiara made famous by Princess Diana.
Kate, 36, joined husband Prince William, 36, and other senior royals for a spectacular dinner hosted in honour of King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands.

In keeping with regal protocol, female members of both the Dutch and British royal families wore ball gowns and tiaras.
The duchess, who was appearing at her third state banquet, wore a dusty kingfisher blue Alexander McQueen gown - and of course that diamond and pearl Cambridge Lover's Knot tiara favoured by Princess Diana.
Kate has also worn it to the Chinese state banquet in 2015 and the Spanish state banquet last year. 
But it seemed she was "out-blinged" by Queen Maxima who was wearing an incredible diamond Stuart tiara.
In tribute to the close links between the British and Dutch royal families, she perhaps chose to wear this fabulously jewelled ornamental band in tribute to the historical bonds between the neighbouring countries. 
The large stone was originally bought in late 17th century by the British monarch William III, also Netherlands's Prince of Orange, for his wife Queen Mary II.

Notably Her Majesty, 92, spoke publicly about Brexit for the first time.
She said: “As we look toward a new partnership with Europe” the values shared by the UK and the Netherlands "are our greatest assets”.
She added that as "innovators, traders and internationalists we look with confidence to the future".

The Queen, who remains impartial in political matters of her realm, opted to emphasise the qualities needed by the UK and its closet European neighbours going forward as her government and parliament continued to be deeply divided by the issue of Brexit.
Earlier, in a speech to both Houses of Parliament, King Willem-Alexander urged the UK Government to lift the "shadow of uncertainty" hanging over Dutch nationals living in Britain and Northern Ireland after Brexit.

In his address at the Buckingham Palace dinner, with the UK's Prime Minister Theresa May seated nearby, King Willem-Alexander said: "At present, a lot of attention is focused on the 'technical' side of Brexit. 
"That's understandable and necessary.
"But in the midst of all that complexity we should not lose sight of the greater narrative that continues to bind us.
"The greater narrative of freedom, openness and cooperation. Of growth and a prosperity whose fruits are enjoyed by all."

The Queen told the Netherlands' head of state: "I recall the state visit of your grandmother Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard in 1972, when I spoke of how our nations' close understanding and relationship would become increasingly important as a new configuration of Europe was emerging.
"As we look toward a new partnership with Europe, it is our shared values and commitment to each other, that are out greatest asset, and demonstrate that even through change, our enduring alliance remains strong, and as innovators, traders and internationalists we look with confidence to the future."

In her speech, the Queen also praised the close links between the UK and Holland which "greatly contributes to the economic and cultural life of Britain".
She added: "The Netherlands are one of the United Kingdom's largest European investors. 
"We have a thriving Dutch community, and artistic and sporting exchanges are at an all-time high".
King Willem-Alexander reiterated comments made before about regretting the UK's decision to leave the EU, but he respected the decision of the British people.
He went on to personally praise the Queen, highlighting her now famous appearance in the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, describing her as the "most fearless Bond Girl ever" for her cameo role alongside 007 played by Daniel Craig.

King Willem-Alexander also told the Queen and her banquet: "In recent decades, you have seen your country, Europe and the world change enormously.
"The world looks to you as a trusted beacon in the midst of upheaval.
"Your ability to keep in touch with the times is striking."
