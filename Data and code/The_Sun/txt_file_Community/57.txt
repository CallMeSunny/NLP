THE Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been virtually inseparable since they tied the knot in May.
But Prince Harry jetted off on a secret trip to Botswana last week, leaving Meghan Markle behind in the UK.

Although the country has special meaning for the couple, Prince Harry spent solo time meeting senior staff and workers from the organisation Rhino Conservation Botswana, of which he is a patron.
Kensington Palace spokeswoman confirmed: "The Duke of Sussex is on a private working trip to Botswana, to join the annual general meeting for Rhino Conservation Botswana in his capacity as patron.
‚ÄúHe attended the board meeting in Maun and an RCB community project in Xarakao village."
According to Royal correspondent Omid Scobie, this is the second time Prince Harry has visited Botswana this year to care for the animals.

The South African organisation works to help protect and increase the populations of black and white rhinos.
It is thought that Prince Harry attended a meeting on Wednesday before touring round the project in the village. He is now believed to be back in the UK.
Speaking to Town and Country in 2015, Prince Harry explained what he does during his African visits.
He said: "I don't go on safari. I come so I can surround myself with people [working in conservation] and support them."

Botswana holds meaning for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, as they jetted off to the country for a romantic African holiday on her 36th birthday last September.
For¬†Meghan's first ever safari, the pair stayed in a luxurious tented bush camp at Meno a Kwena boasting incredible views over the Boteti River and African bush.

He reminisced to BBC: ‚ÄúWe camped out with each other under the stars.
"She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic. So then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure that we had a chance to know each other.‚Äù
The trip even meant so much that Harry sourced the diamond in¬†Meghan's engagement ring from Botswana¬†- the world's biggest producer.

As well as¬†Meghan's birthday, the trip also marked the couple's first anniversary.
Botswana, a country of around two million spread over an area the size of France, has always been important to Harry.
He first visited when he was 13, two months after his mother Princess Diana died, and he has returned several times for leisure and charity work.
