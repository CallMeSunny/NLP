THE man set to undergo the world's first HEAD transplant had Good Morning Britain fans baffled by the groundbreaking surgery.
The skull of wheelchair-bound and terminally ill Valery Spiridonov will be attached to a completely different body when he undergoes the dramatic procedure.

This will involve freezing his body, cutting the neck and spinal chord and moving the head onto the donor body, before it is reattached using a special type of glue.
Talking about the decision to have the surgery Valery, who suffers from a genetic muscle wasting disease, said: "My motivation is about improving my own life condition.
"It's to get to the stage where I will be able to take care of myself and independent from other people."
He added: "Today my life is tough. I need people to help me every day, twice a day."
ITV6 He hopes the surgery will give him more life independence
After his revelation on today's Good Morning Britain fans took top Twitter to share their shock and surprise.
A transfixed viewer wrote: "So there's going to be a first head transplant... Have I woke up in the twilight zone???"
One wrote: "Oh. My. Days.... WORLDS FIRST HEAD TRANSPLANT.." while another added: "For real? A head transplant?"

Clearly perplexed, one shared their confusion about the pioneering process.
They took to the social media site to write: "That bloke this morning on GMB who wants the first head transplant ¬†Just can't get my head around it."
Another speculated: "Bloody head transplant, feel like I'm in the future!

One shared their view and added: "The first ever head transplant. now that's Frankenstein's monster come true."

Italian neurosurgeon Dr Sergio Canavero will be taking charge of the surgery which sees the brain dead head of a donor transplanted onto that of Valery's.
The medic told the show he was confident of its success.
Previously, he has revealed the ground-breaking operation will take place in December 2017.
He has detailed Valery's head will be cooled to minus 15 degrees Celcius before being severed.
ITV6 He detailed his hopes for the surgery, which will be performed next year, on breakfast show GMB
Yet Dr Canavero has been blasted by fellow experts saying his surgery is not plausible because of issues connecting the spinal chords, while also raising ethical dilemmas.
Strong critic¬†Alberto Delitala, president of the Italian Society of Neurosurgery, said:¬†"If Canavero really had found a revolutionary technique to reconnect the spinal cord, then why not apply it to people with spinal cord injury before attempting a head transplant? ... I think that Canavero's proposal is an escapist flight of fancy which unfortunately today is not possible."
ITV6 Valery wants to live a more independent life
He added: "Our association's stance is very clear: the central theme in the scientific method is that any new technique must be based on experimental tests submitted to an international scientific community before being applied to human beings. But Canavero has never been able to prove that he has succeeded in a head transplant on an animal."
ITV6 GMB's Dr Hilary expressed concern the body would reject the donor head
After his time on the treatment table Valery will spend four weeks in an induced coma as his body heals.
GMB's own Dr Hilary raised his eyebrows as to the prospects of its success.
He said the worse case scenario would be Valery's body would reject the head of the donor.
