Speaking to the MailOnline, uncle Jeremy Soutter said the young athlete had faced pressure from her competition but had never given any indication she would take her own life.
He said: "She wanted to be good at everything. She expected a lot of herself.
"There's certainly a lot of pressure from competing. The travelling is immense too. She had a very busy training schedule and generally all of that takes its toll."
Family has today flocked to the French Alps, where Ellie lived with her father Tony Soutter, to gather for a memorial for the teen - initially planned to be a birthday celebration for the young woman.

Teen¬†Ellie was considered one of Team GB's great hopes for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, having claimed Team GB's only medal at the¬†European Youth Olympic Winter Festival in Erzurum, Turkey last year.
The¬†teen had been forced to stop competing at the beginning of this year due to a lack of funding but she was able to start again and was expected to compete in the junior world championships in New Zealand next month.

Her dad Tony had recently shared an appeal to help his daughter's career, saying there was little or no financial assistance coming in for her sport.
In February, he wrote: "Ellie should now be in full swing with both the Europa Cup boardercross circuit and Junior Freeride World Tour, throughout Europe also training full time with her coach Deborah Anthonioz, racking up FIS points so she can move on to the World Cup circuit and gain selection to the 2022 winter Olympics in Beijing.
"Due to the lack of funds this has all had to come to a halt."
He later thanked supporters for helping to raise cash that would go towards her summer training.
