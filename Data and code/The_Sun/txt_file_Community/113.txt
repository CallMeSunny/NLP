She's endured a notoriously rocky relationship with Caben's dad, Irish model Jeremy McConnell, and the couple are no longer together.
They initially split in May 2016 just before Stephanie announced her pregnancy.
After Caben was born, they briefly rekindled their romance earlier this year, before splitting one again after Jeremy assaulted her.
