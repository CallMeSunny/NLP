She's teamed up with two more of Instagram's most-followed ‘fitspos’ to launch what is promising to be one of the biggest online fitness programmes to date.
         View this post on Instagram           If you are just beginning your health and fitness journey, I have one tip for you. Do it for the right reasons. You need to do things because you want to. Not because someone made you feel uncomfortable and you are trying to prove them wrong, not because you want to impress someone, not because you want to beat someone and certainly not for a boy or girl. You need to want to do these things for YOU, because YOU want to be better, faster, stronger, happier and healthier. Yes, some things may motivate you, but don't let them be the only reason you do something. Treat you body right, you deserve it. www.kaylaitsines.com/app #bbg A post shared by  KAYLA ITSINES (@kayla_itsines) on May 13, 2017 at 10:41pm PDT

Kayla Itsines, 25, Kelsey Wells 27, and Sjana Elise Earp, 23, are thought of as incredibly influential women in their own right within the fitness community, and - with a combined social media following of 20 million worldwide - never before has a fitness programme started life with such a following.
Called SWEAT, the programme is an app-based course downloaded directly onto your smartphone.
Already being dubbed the ‘Netflix of fitness’ - from personalised meal plans and video workout routines to step trackers and hydration monitors, the app is the first of its kind to offer such extensive plans worldwide.
Kayla Itsines4 The super-fit trio - (L-R) Sjana, Kayla and Kelsey - already have huge followings individually
Each of the programme’s trainers has a different speciality to help with your own personal goals.
Kayla is a high intensity plyometric and resistance trainer – and her own plan, the Bikini Body Guide, claims to have transformed the figures of over 25 million women.
Kelsey Wells specialises in post-pregnancy training, while Sjana Elsie Earp is SWEAT’s resident yogi, teaching you how to stretch, tone and… sweat your way fitter and healthier.
Recipes, meal plans, workouts, tips and guidance are all provided as well a video feature - and the app’s videos allow you to workout alongside each trainer, checking your form and pushing you through your workout.
The app will start with 750 exercises to choose from and over 400 recipes while users can also use automated shopping lists and meal preparation guides.

CEO and founder of SWEAT, Tobi Pearce, also Kayla’s long term partner, says: “I wanted a place that offers a wider community of women a way to connect with one another and share their journey.
“I was determined to educate and empower not just some women, but women of all shapes, sizes and preferences to live their healthiest life.
“This desire set me on my path to develop SWEAT as it is now, and motivates me for what it will be in the future.”

Fitness blogger Kelsey runs Instagram feed My Sweat Life and is a female empowerment and Post Pregnancy training expert.
She rose to fame online after posting pictures of her incredible transformation from post-pregnancy figure to gym-honed.
She made a name after urging her followers to 'screw the scale' as she showed how her weight increased as her body has become more lean and toned.
Kelsey, from Houston, Texas, advised people to "stop getting hung up on the number on the stupid scale".
Kelsey, whose has a son Anderson, three, says: "I have never been more comfortable in my own skin than I am now.
"And if I didn't say #screwthescale long ago, I would have gave up on my journey [sic]."
Kelsey has created her new post-pregnancy SELF (Strong Empowered Life through Fitness) program, the first of a series of programmes she has developed exclusively for the SWEAT app.
It is designed to help women feel strong and empowered and assist mums to regain their strength after having children.
