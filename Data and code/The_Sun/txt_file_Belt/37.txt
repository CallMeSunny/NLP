A WOMAN who was the sole survivor of a terrifying 1992 plane crash in the Vietnamese jungle has told her story of her near-death experience.
Former Wall Street trader Annette Herflens, a Dutch woman now living in New York, spent seven days in the jungle waiting to be rescued after the 23 other passengers and six crew members died when the plane went down.

CNN4 Her fiance at the time, who she had been with for 13 years, died during the plane crash she was also involved in in 1992
She has written a book about her harrowing experience 24 years ago, where she lost her fiance and almost perished herself, after they boarded a flight from Ho Chi Minh City for a surprise romantic getaway in Nha Trang, a resort on the South China Sea on November 14, 1992.
She spoke to the New York Post about her story of endurance.
She said: "I was excited for the surprise getaway. But I felt so claustrophobic I shuddered as we boarded the cramped Vietnam Airlines plane. “Can’t we take a car instead?” I asked Pasje [her fiance].
“The jungle is very dense, and the road is horrible,” he replied. “It would take days. By the time we get there, we would have to leave again.”

I sat down nervously. Fifty excruciating minutes later we experienced a tremendous drop, and Pasje looked at me with fear. “Of course, a s***ty little toy plane drops like this!”
"I said, reaching for his hand. “It’s just an air pocket — don’t worry.”
"It went pitch-black. Seconds later, we made impact.
"I don’t remember exactly what happened, but I guess I tumbled around in the cabin like a lonely piece of laundry in a clothes dryer, hitting my head and limbs against the ceiling and lockers.
"I may have been the only one not wearing a seat belt.
"At some point I must have landed and slipped under a seat, legs first, and gotten stuck. This kept me in place for the second, bigger impact, which caused the plane to break up."

She awoke hours later and saw her boyfriend of 13 years laying dead nearby.
After crawling out of the destroyed plane she realised her hips were shattered and could see a fragment of bone poking out of her shin.
She was kept company by a Vietnamese man, who was also badly injured, and he told her not to worry as help would come.
A few hours later the man died from his wounds and she was alone.
In order to stay alive Annette managed to rip small pieces of insulation she found near the shattered wing of the plane and used them to soak up rainwater to keep hydrated.
She gave herself a week to stay in the spot she was in, and if no one came to find her she would try to move.
CNN4 Out of 23 passengers and six crew members, she was the only person to survive the terrifying crash
After seven days alone and badly injured, she heard the sound of cracking wood.
She said: "On the other side of the ravine was a man in an orange hood. I wondered whether he was real or a phantom.
"Some version of St. Peter? I waved frantically. “Hello? Can you help me?” He just stared at me and stayed motionless. Then he was gone.
"The orange man, a local policeman, turned out to be my saviour. The authorities were looking for me. And although he first thought I was a ghost — he’d never seen a white woman before — he raised the alarm. The following day I was rescued by a team of Vietnamese workers.
"They showed me a passenger list from the flight and I pointed out my name. They had body bags with them, thinking that nobody could possibly have lived."
She was airlifted to Ho Chi Minh City before being transferred to a hospital in Singapore, where she was treated and miraculously made a full recovery.
The cause of the plane crash is still unknown.
