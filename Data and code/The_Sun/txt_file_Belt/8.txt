The vehicle, which appears to be a 2016 Maserati Ghibli, was lent to Shi by his friend, who was not in the car.
The CCTV footage shows Shi speeding into view on the largely empty motorway - before suddenly veering to the right.
He then slams into the motorway's crash barriers, wrecking the sports car.
Shi admitted to investigators that he had been speeding at the time of the crash, going at up to 111mph in a 75mph zone.

Shi and his two passengers survived without serious injury thanks to their seat belts, reports said.
It has since been revealed that the owner of the car paid over £112,651 for the Maserati after tax.
The car’s insurer is not expected to pay out in full due to the unlawful cause of the accident, the police said.
