But David Moyes' tactics were undone five minutes before half time.
Fabregas played a one-two with Willian, receiving the ball back on the edge of the box¬†and picking out the bottom corner with a curling effort.
Sunderland left it late to press for an equaliser and were only denied by the superb Thibaut Courtois.
The Belgian had a quiet night but was alert and focused in injury time to keep out first Jason Denayer, and then Patrick van Aanholt.
Chelsea now lead second-placed Arsenal by six points, while basement boys Sunderland remain bottom with 11 points.

Facts, stats, goals & lols

Sunderland welcomed five-year-old fan Bradley Lowery to join with their warm-up ‚Äì and even scored past Chelsea stopper Asmir Begovic. He is suffering from neuroblastoma, a rare childhood cancer, and is sadly not expected to stay alive long into 2017.
Oscar was missing from the Chelsea squad. He says he is ‚Äú90 per cent certain‚Äù to move to Chinese Super League side Shanghai SIPG in January.

Eden Hazard was also out for the first time this season. He picked up a knock against West Brom.

Sunderland‚Äôs injury curse has hit again. They have already had more crocks than any other side this season. And against Chelsea they were without Steven Pienaar and Victor Anichebe.


It meant two 17-year-olds, Joel Asoro and Josh Maja, were in their squad against the Blues.

With his limited options, David Moyes sprung a surprise by matching Chelsea‚Äôs formation and going with three centre-halves for the first time this season ‚Äì John O‚ÄôShea being recalled.

Sunderland had three former Chelsea players in their side. But between them, Patrick van Aanholt, Papy Djilobodji and Fabio Borini only made six league appearances for the Blues.


Jermain Defoe is the only player to have scored against Chelsea with four different Premier League clubs. He scored Sunderland‚Äôs third in a 3-2 win here versus the Blues in May.


What a difference a year makes. On this day last year, a defeat away to Leicester left Chelsea just a point above the relegation zone. Now they are six points clear at the top.

Cesc Fabregas scored his first league goal of the season in just his third Prem start this term.

What they said
Cesc Fabregas on Conte's new system: "People forget this is the second time in my life I have played in this system.
"But I feel very comfortable, I have protection behind me. I'm really enjoying it, I think it suits me a lot.
"We want to keep winning. We know this period of the year we can send a strong message and hopefully we can continue like this."
David Moyes: "The team deserves a pat on the back for their effort, and how they tried to play against such a good team as Chelsea."
On Sunderland's limited transfer funds, he added: "The job is to work with the tools you have.
"We've got the squad, they've been here before and done it before.
"If the squad keeps playing the way they did tonight it will give us a chance [to survive]."
