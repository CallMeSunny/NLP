JO PAVEY became Britain's oldest female track competitor at a Games in a race overshadowed by an Ethiopian smashing one of the world's dodgiest world records.
Wang Junxia - one of the infamous Ma's Army - set the women's 10,000m world record of 29:31.78 in China back in 1993 and it's legitimacy has long been questioned.

The IAAF - the sport's governing body- are still investigating evidence that emerged earlier this year that Wang, who still holds the 3,000m world record, admitted in a letter in 1995 that she was part of a state-sponsored doping system.
On Friday, in the FIRST final of the athletics programme at the Rio Games, Ethiopian Almaz Ayana smashed that mark by almost 14 SECONDS herself clocking 29:17.45 to take Olympic gold in only her second race over the distance. The 24 year-old was so far ahead of the field that she finished almost 15 SECONDS of Kenyan Vivian Cheruiyot who had to settle for silver despite setting a national record. The first 13 finishers ran the fastest race of their life.
SunSport understands there was concern that Ayana would not even race, having seemed ill in the call-room - the area where athletes are held before going out onto the track.
Pavey, 42, who is competing at a record FIVE Games and clocked at season's best of 31:33.44, admitted: "I found it tough out there.
"You don't think the Chinese records will ever go. You don't always thing of them as records really.
"I never thought that would happen. It was absolutely unbelievable. I don't know whether to have been pleased or not to have been in that.
"You can't say anything unless you've got any proof. You've just got to admire performances until you know differently. Unfortunately this sport has had a lot of dark days in the past few months. I've got no reason to say everybody who does well is cheating. You just have to hope you can believe what your seeing.
"I'm so honoured to have competed at my fifth Olympics, but in reality I am getting old. I would like to have been more competitive, but I gave my best and that is all I could do."

But many other distance stars were also left questioning the performance of Ayana, who won world 5,000m gold in Beijing last summer.
Paula Radcliffe, the world marathon record holder who set a European 10,000m record of 30.01.09 in 2002, said: "I'm not sure that I can understand that. When I saw the world record set in 1993, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. And Ayana has absolutely blitzed that time."
And Brendan Foster, Olympic 10,000m bronze medallist, said: "You see things pushed along sometimes - you think of Bob Beamon in the long jump - but I'm not sure what to make of that to be honest."
American Emily Infield, who finished 11th with a personal best of 31:26.94, summed it up saying: "There;s no way I could compete with that, there's no way I could run with that."
Reuters3 Ayana was asked about doping in the aftermath of her performance
Junren's athletes, who were known as Ma's Army, won every women's gold medal from 1500m to 10,000m at the 1993 World Championships in Stuttgart. Wang's 10,000m mark knocked 42 seconds off the old record and was until yesterday still 22 seconds faster than any other woman has run. But the 43-year-old retired in 1997 having never failed a drugs test.
Ma himself has consistently denied using performance-enhancing drugs claiming the fast performances were down to the turtle blood and other natural Chinese remedies he gave to his athletes.
Anyana, whose previous best was 30mins 7secs, described her achievement as a "dream come true".
"I never thought that this would happen and I'm so in awe.
"I'm very happy to get here."
Asked about doping, she added: "My doping is my training. My doping is Jesus. Otherwise, I’m crystal clear."
