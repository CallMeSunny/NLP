SMASH-HIT smartphone maker OnePlus is branching out into televisions.
The Chinese tech firm – which has gained a cult following for its budget-friendly iPhone rivals – has confirmed plans to launch a new OnePlus TV. Here's everything we know so far.
OnePlus2 OnePlus is asking fans to name its first-ever television set
OnePlus TV – what is it?
Details are thin right now – all we really know is that it's a Smart TV, which isn't exactly a revolutionary concept.
It'll be built by a brand new company division, separate from the core smartphone business.
And the official announcement says the company is "taking its first steps in developing a smart TV", which suggests OnePlus isn't very far along with development.
Speaking about his new venture, OnePlus boss Pete Lau said: "I dream about a time when technology is truly seamless, an effortless part of your life without being the focus.

He continued: "As other consumer electronics have evolved and improved our lives, televisions have remained conventional and cumbersome.
"We bring inherent advantages to the industry, and with this new division, we're excited to explore the total connected user experience that can enhance everyday life."
Pete has worked in the smartphone and Blu-ray player industries for over two decades, but it remains to be seen whether he can pull off a must-have telly.
OnePlus TV features and specs – what will it do?
It'll be a long while before we learn about exact hardware specifications.
But OnePlus has dropped at least two big hints about the capabilities of its smart telly.
"For most of us, there are four major environments we experience each day: the home, the workplace, the commute, and being on-the-move," OnePlus founder Pete explained.
"The home – perhaps the most important environment experience – is just starting to enjoy the benefits of intelligent connectivity.
"Something that seems as simple as displaying the photos from your mobile phone to a television is still difficult to achieve.
"With the development of AI technology, our imagination is endless – and we are looking forward to the future."
The first hint is the reference to "intelligent connectivity".
What that probably means is you'll be able to sync your TV to smartphone very effectively, transferring content and apps between them easily.
There's often very little communication between your smartphone and television, which is ironic given that they're both two of our most-used gadgets.
What's not clear is whether the OnePlus TV will work seamlessly with all phones – or just OnePlus models.
The other big hint is Pete's mention of "AI technology".
OnePlus hasn't made any significant moves in the artificial intelligence space, which sets it apart from some of its keener rivals like Apple, Google and Samsung.
Creating an AI-powered TV could mean a bunch of different things.
At the most basic level, it could mean that your television will use machine learning to improve the user experience. That could be something as simple as making better recommendations about what shows you should watch, based on what you already like.
But it could also mean creating a fully-fledged virtual assistant of its own – like Apple's Siri, Samsung's Bixby, Amazon's Alexa or the Google Assistant.
What is Alexa?If you've never heard of Alexa, here's what you need to know...

Alexa is an "intelligent" personal assistant built by Amazon.
You can find her on several different devices, including Amazon's Echo speakers.
Alexa responds to voice commands, and can talk back to you.
She can perform thousands of different tasks, including telling you about the news or weather.
But she can do more complex things too, like ordering a pizza or arranging an Uber taxi pick-up.
To activate Alexa, you need to say "Alexa" to an Amazon Echo speaker.
Alexa currently only works in English and German languages.
Because she's powered by artificial intelligence, Alexa is constantly getting smarter.
Alexa will also get more used to your voice, and better understand what you want her to do over time.


TV makers haven't really pushed voice-controlled assistants onto their televisions in any meaningful way, so OnePlus could set its self apart there.
It would also be a wise play, as the AI could also be rolled out onto OnePlus smartphones, killing two birds with one stone.
Alternatively, OnePlus could simply borrow an existing virtual assistant, load that onto the TV, and save itself a load of work.
OnePlus TV release date – when is it out?
There's no word on an actual release date, but the official OnePlus announcement suggests the company is still in the early stages of development.
That probably puts the OnePlus TV at years – rather than months – away.
A OnePlus spokesperson told The Sun: "We don't have any further news to share right now, but please stay tuned to our official channels for future updates."
So that means the best way to stay in the loop will be to keep a watchful eye on the very active OnePlus social media channels.
OnePlus TV name – what will it be called
Interestingly, the OnePlus TV doesn't have a name yet.
Instead, OnePlus wants fans of the brand to name their upcoming telly.
"OnePlus TV is our latest exploration of how technology can improve our digital wellbeing, we couldn’t imagine a better group of people to help begin its legacy," a OnePlus rep explained on the brand's official forums.
"To kick off this journey, we ask for your help in giving our TV product something truly special: a NAME. Of course, we’ve cooked up some prizes to give in return."

OnePlus TV price – how much will it cost?
Pricing for the OnePlus TV will be very interesting – but nothing is confirmed at this stage.
OnePlus promises to "address gaps in the television industry" in the same way it disrupted the smartphone market.
For phones, OnePlus came in fast with high-spec, low-cost handsets that made people question why they were spending £700+ on Apple and Samsung mobiles.
It's entirely possibly OnePlus will do the same thing for televisions.
If we had to guess, we'd imagine cheap telly models that cost below £500, but come with premium features like a 4K screen and support for High Dynamic Range content.
