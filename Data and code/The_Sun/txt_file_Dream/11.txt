GO in with the New in Fontwell’s 3.45.
NEW MILLENNIUM (nap) wasn’t suited by being held up on testing ground at Sandown three weeks ago.
1 Lingfield, Fontwell, Wetherby and Newcastle come under the spotlight as Templegate gives you his best bets for the day
He’s much happier on decent going as he showed when making all the running at Leicester in January.
This is a drop in grade and it’s hard to see anything living with him up front.
SHINTORI (4.50 Fontwell, nb) blundered away his chance at Taunton last time out.
He probably hit the front too soon n his previous start at Plumpton so he’s obviously up to winning a race like this.
A return to 2m3f should help.
THOSEDAYSAREGONE (4.30 Wetherby, treble) had little trouble beating Simply A Legend over today’s track and trip in January.
He beat Grand National hope Mall Dini over fences a couple of weeks ago and still looks nicely weighted.
