In a video uploaded to his private Instagram account, Pelle can be seen practising on a stepper machine.
He captioned the post: "'Follow your DREAM ... Take one step at a time and don't settle for less, just continue to CLIMB' #quotes #lifeis1 #nike #training #vacation"

Pelle and Varga, who also uploaded snaps of themselves on holiday in Australia this month, posted a number of photos from their latest getaway.
The pair looked over the moon on a couple of jet skis in one picture.
In another Pelle shows off his dapper look in a smart shirt and gold watch at dinner, while Varga flaunts her figure in an ocean shot on her own private account.
Tetiaroa, also known as The Brando, is a luxurious celebrity resort in the middle of the Pacific ocean.
Hollywood legend Brando, who died aged 80 in July 2004, is said to have been passionate about the island's natural beauty and teamed up with Richard Bailey, a long-time resident of Tahiti, another of the French Polynesia isles, to purchase it.
