RICH travellers with enough cash for first class air tickets are taking to social media to share snaps of their amazing-looking grub.
Their dinners – which look better than the food served up in many restaurants – will leave you green with envy.

Most travellers only dream of turning left on a jet and into the expensive world of the well-upholstered club class and first class seats.
The price of a first class return from London to New York, for example, can reach well over the £5,000-mark so it is little wonder fliers want more than soggy sausage mash and a can of Stella Artois to wash it down.
So while you're chewing on a grey piece of chicken in Economy, they are dining on smoked trout starters, steak and asparagus and dim sum.
But take a look at your peril - because you'll never be happy with that free mini bottle of red wine again...

Today we bring you a menu of gourmet meals presented to money bags passengers at the posh end of the aircraft.
For instance, Air Canada serves up Chinese treats as a mid-flight snack that most restaurants would have been proud of, and Singapore Air serve cheeses with crackers, nuts and fruits at the end of a meal.
One traveller from Chicago shared a picture of his giant seafood platter of lobster, prawns and crab, labelling it “airplane food at its finest" and a “once in a lifetime airplane dining experience. Freshness Seattle goodness.”
For those of us who can't afford a First Class ticket, there are other ways to make sure your plane food tastes good.

One top chef has a nifty trick for improving the taste - Jason Atherton, who earned a Michelin star in 2011 with his London restaurant Pollen Street Social and now runs restaurant group The Social Company.
Jason, who said he flew around 800,000 kilometres a year, told finance newspaper Mint that he tries his best to avoid in-flight meals but if he had to, he used some advice from his Hollywood mate Jude Law.
He said: “It was Law who told me to always take Tabasco on a plane - aeroplane food is always bland, so it’s great to give it kick.
Alternatively, try noise-cancelling headphones.
An Oxford professor has revealed that wearing noise-cancelling headphones when eating can make plane grub taste better.
Professor Charles Spence wrote Gastrophysics: The New Science of Eating, and is an expert on taste and food.

He told the Telegraph: “Donning a pair of noise-cancelling headphones could actually be one of the simplest ways in which to make food and drink taste better at altitude.
“The lower cabin pressure, dry cabin air and loud engine noise all contribute to our inability to taste and smell food and drink.”
However, it might all be a lost cause anyway - according to the experts, there are only a few items on the menu that can are just about edible.

The trick, according to Fritz Gross, director of culinary excellence at LSG Sky Chefs Asia Pacific, is to always pick the stew or casserole.
Fritz told CNN: “We can simmer it and reheat it over and over and it will still be a stew.”
Similarly, fried rice can be reheated and still retain its flavour and texture.
When it comes to pudding, there’s only one option there too – go frozen.
Aviation website InFlightFeed’s creator, Nikos Loukas, told Insider: “Ice cream is really good. It tastes the same in the air as it does on the ground.”
