She matched it with a thigh-grazing navy miniskirt and black boots as a minder held an umbrella over her head as she got out of her car.
Jasmine embraced the wet weather, holding her hand out to catch raindrops and smiling brightly for the cameras.
The beauty displayed her slender midriff and svelte legs in skintight leather trousers.
Taylor looked angelic in a baggy white minidress and held her eye-catching feathered wings which wouldn't have looked out of place on the catwalk.
Lily Aldridge also clutched her wings as she walked wearing a loose-fitting tee, dark trousers and black stilettos.
Candice Swanepoel's endless legs were on display in a white shirt dress which cinched at the waist and a pair of strappy heels which complemented her handbag.
