As the world's most marketable athlete, a hero's return by the Ballon d'Or holder would swell United's already-brimming coffers.
The club would make massive profits - raking in cash from shirt and ticket sales if he returned to Old Trafford.
That's despite a world record fee being needed to bring him back and Ronaldo getting a world record wage packet.
But even if Manchester United miss out on a dream reunion and Ronaldo is still sold, the club can expect some cash.

The Solidarity MechanismHow are Manchester United entitled to a cut of Cristiano Ronaldo's fee?

Article 21 of Fifa's Regulations in the Status and Transfer of Players is the 'Solidarity Mechanism' - which rewards clubs who have trained a young player that goes on to make big moves
The rule states: "If a professional is transferred before the expiry of his contract, any club that has contributed to his education and training shall receive a proportion of the compensation paid to his former club (solidarity contribution)"
Manchester United are entitles to 2.5 per cent of the total transfer fee, Sporting Lisbon 2.25 per cent and Nacional 0.25 per cent
There is also Article 20 that handles Training Compensation, it states: “Training compensation shall be paid to a player’s training club(s): (1) when a player signs his first contract as a professional and (2) each time a professional is transferred until the end of the season of his 23rd birthday
The obligation to pay training compensation arises whether the transfer takes place during or at the end of the player’s contract.

So Manchester United, Portuguese giants Sporting Lisbon and Nacional, a club on the island of Madeira, can all expect a slice of his next fee.
Five per cent of the total fee is allocated to clubs.
Manchester United would take half of that five per cent (2.5 per cent of the value of the transfer), Sporting, 45 per cent (2.25 per cent) and the National the remaining 5 per cent (0.25 per cent).
The £122MILLION that PSG are willing to offer Ronaldo will see United net a tidy £3m (a full breakdown of figures is at the bottom of the page).
Not bad for barely lifting a finger.
Cristiano Ronaldo factfile

Cristiano Ronaldo was born in Funchal, Madeira - a Portuguese archipelago - on February 5, 1982
He came through the youth systems of Nacional and Sporting Lisbon, before Sir Alex Ferguson was so impressed with his performance in a pre-season friendly against Manchester United that he decided to buy him
In six seasons at Old Trafford, Ronaldo became one of the best players in world football, scoring 118 goals in 292 games
He won the FA Cup in 2004, the League Cup in 2006 and 2009 and three consecutive Premier League titles from 2007 to 2009
Ronaldo and United also beat Chelsea to the Champions League in Russia in 2008 - resulting in his first Ballon d'Or that year
The Portuguese star joined Real Madrid for a then-world record fee of £80million in 2009
At the Bernabeu Ronaldo has developed into one of the best players ever. He is the club's all-time top goalscorer, with a ridiculous 406 goals in just 394 matches
Ronaldo has won the Copa del Rey twice, La Liga twice and the Champions League three times - last season saw Ronaldo lead Los Blancos to a League and Champions League double
The No 7 also helped Portugal to a famous European Championship win in 2016
Ronaldo has won various individual awards, including the Ballon d'Or four times. He is the heavy favourite to win the Ballon d'Or again this year
The Portuguese is also the world's highest paid athlete

Ronaldo is the world's richest sports star and only trails in worldwide shirt sales to rival Lionel Messi - 'Ronaldo 7' makes up 40 per cent of Real Madrid's total shirt sales.
His share of the market is expected to rise this year after helping Real Madrid win a La Liga and Champions League double, with Ronaldo also the favourite to win another Ballon d'Or at the end of the year.
United remain the frontrunners for Ronaldo.
The Portuguese star told agent Jorge Mendes to do "everything possible" to get him back to Old Trafford - despite the frosty relationship with Jose Mourinho.
The pair are ready to bury the hatchet after their public falling out while at Real Madrid.
Bayern Munich had been linked with a move for the star, but club legend Karl-Heinz Rummenigge issued a scathing rebuttal, branding it "hoax of the day".
