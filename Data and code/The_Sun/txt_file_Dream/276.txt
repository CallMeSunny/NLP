THEY want our footballers. No doubt about it.
After all, they are offering up to £500,000 A WEEK, and have  targeted Alexis Sanchez to join Oscar in becoming the next big star to leave English football for the Chinese Super League.

It is one trod previously by former Stamford Bridge club-mates Ramires and Demba Ba and ex-Spurs midfielder Paulinho among others.
That the Chinese believe — with good reason — that they can even tempt  players from the richest league in Europe speaks volumes.
But the money men from behind the Bamboo Curtain want our football, too.
Starting in the West Midlands in a spending spree which has snaffled up Aston Villa, Birmingham, West Brom and Wolves.
Taking in as much of Europe as they can acquire, with any available clubs on the agenda.

And, if there was any remaining doubt that the Chinese will do it THEIR way, ignoring any opposition, it came as   Gianfranco Zola — universally lauded as one of the nicest men in the game — squirmed uncomfortably under a fusillade of aggressive questions at St Andrew’s yesterday.
Since the start of last year, a series of Chinese investors have splurged a  staggering sum of nearly £2billion on European clubs.
It is state-backed with President Xi Jinping  publicly admitting his ambition is to turn China into a global football powerhouse.
And with a seemingly bottomless pool of cash at their disposal, the men from the Far East are not simply playing games.
Xi said: “Revitalising soccer is a must to build China into a sports powerhouse as part of the Chinese dream. It is also what the people desire.”
They are deadly serious.

Utterly determined. And completely set on achieving their agenda.
The twin-track policy of  enticing as many European-based stars to the CSL as they can, while simultaneously hoovering up clubs up and down the continent, shows no sign of slowing down.
In addition to the five English clubs already brought into the fold, including Manchester City where Zhong An  Holdings took a 13 per cent stake in the summer, there have been consortia sniffing around both Liverpool and Hull.
Were the likes of West Ham or Spurs to go on the market, you can rest assured the most persistent bidders would come with Chinese passports, too.

Cash-rich and multinational investment groups such as Dalian Wanda, Wolves owners Fosun International and China Media Capital, see football as part of an integrated sports business.
Wanda, who took a 20 per cent stake in Atletico Madrid for around £45m, have bought Swiss sports rights agency Infront Media, while Everbright, the so-far spurned potential investors in Liverpool, have joint control of another sports rights group, MP & Silva.
At the same time, with a similar intensity, the Chinese will not walk back on their recruitment drive. The ultimate aim is to host the 2026 World Cup finals.
Making the CSL a magnet league, they feel, will be proof China is ready to host the biggest football tournament on the planet.

Zhang Dazhong is chief executive of Alisports, an offshoot of  e-commerce giant Alibaba.
He has already cultivated strong links with super-agent Jorge Mendes and laid the  reality on the line.
Zhang said: “The consumption power in China is huge and gigantic — the consumption of sport is about to burst in China.”

The takeovers have brought concerns.
Zola’s unexpected appointment at Birmingham — certainly something of a shock to the axed Gary Rowett — is seen by many as further evidence that the Chinese will happily ride roughshod over the concept  of traditional  values, or explanation. Trillion Trophy Asia, controlled by businessman Paul Suen, did not exactly justify  Rowett’s dismissal.

It all  added to the frustrations of Blues fans still bruised by seven years under Carson Yeung, who ended his reign from a jail cell in Hong Kong.
Wolves — run on behalf of Fosun by Jeff Shi — appointed Walter Zenga out of nowhere before realising he simply was not up to Championship speed and quickly replaced him with Paul Lambert.
And Dr Tony Xia’s first manager at Aston Villa, Roberto Di Matteo, was swiftly booted out as Steve Bruce came in.
But Guochuan Lai, who claims he was entranced by tales of West Brom’s famous 1978 trip to China before buying out The Hawthorns club, brought every fan a free pint at their game with Everton. And under Xia at Villa, the Great Wall of Silence has come crashing down.

The chatty owner engages with his 50,000-plus army of Twitter followers on a regular basis — daily if not more.
If anything, as Di Matteo might agree, Xia has been too candid when it comes to throwing away leads or the mentality of his players.
A source close to the club revealed: “Tony Xia is a shrewd operator.
“He knows there will not be a great deal of sell-on value in someone like Mile Jedinak, who will be 35 by the end of his contract.

“But guys like him and Ross McCormack are needed now — in the past we bought young, hungry players with potential from the lower leagues and look at where it got us.
“Now we are investing in potential — we want results NOW!”
Today the West Midlands, it seems. Tomorrow the world.
