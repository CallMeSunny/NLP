1. Don't quote me
Posting on Reddit, houseofleopold said: "Any combination of the following words: dream, laugh, hope, love, live, dance.
"It's like build your own inspirational quote. Yes, so inspiring on your foot."
2. Made in China
"I've overheard an American guy bragging about the Chinese character on his arm, he thinks it means brave, it means turtle," said bananaslugholly.
"We have the same thing in Asia, where people tattoo a nonsense combination of English words on themselves.

"I've personally seen a girl with 'life is lemon' on her lower back."
Stonegageman added: "To date the best tattoo I've ever seen was on a 65 year old woman's forearm that said 'I don't know, it's Chinese' in Chinese."
3. Oh so spiritual

cunninglinguistician said his pet peeve was customers "getting random Hindu/Buddhist symbols without having any idea what they're called or what they mean because they want people to know they're 'spiritual'."
4. To infinity and beyond

system_failure said: "I am really over the whole infinity symbol or infinity symbol + words within it and birds flying off it and whatever else they can think of to squish into such a tiny design."
But ladycoleopterist disagreed, writing: "I will never tire of infinity symbols, however. Easy, and the most money for my time!"

5. This one makes them really cross
BriarrRose said he hated "unattractive, straight up ugly crosses. To me it's a shame when people have bad taste in crosses.
"It's such a simple thing that's supposed to be meaningful yet some people can't seem to get past the second page of google images."

And joees added: "I saw a picture a few weeks back of a guy who had a cross tattoo'd on his chest. Like, over his heart. Which is kinda cheesy, but sure why not.
"But then he got¬†another¬†tattoo of those rosary bead things around his neck with a cross hanging down from it, giving him¬†two¬†crosses.
"Now I'm not one to judge, but it looks pretty f***ing stupid."

miawall4ce's pet peeve was a bit more niche.
She said: "I've tattooed spongebob square pants showing his butt on three different frat butts (that didn't know each other) and it's starting to get old."
