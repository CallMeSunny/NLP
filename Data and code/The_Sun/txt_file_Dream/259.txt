CHELSEA moved eight points clear of Arsenal this evening as Diego Costa marked his 100th¬†Blues appearance with a goal against Hull.
Antonio Conte‚Äôs decision to restore Costa to his starting XI paid off when the striker pounced late in the first half to wreck Hull‚Äôs hopes of taking a point.

But a nasty head injury to Ryan Mason saw an incredible NINE minutes added prior to the break, and Costa ensured his side went in ahead when he latched on to a fine cross from Victor Moses moments before the whistle was blown.
The Spaniard had received a fantastic reception from the Stamford Bridge faithful at kick-off despite being linked with a lucrative move to China just last week.

And Costa appeared to imply he‚Äôs going nowhere with a cheeky celebration aimed at silencing any lurking gossipers.
However, the timely goal could not hide an unconvincing performance by Chelsea, with Hull shutting up shop and mirroring their five-man defence in a bid to frustrate Eden Hazard and Pedro.

FACTS, STATS, GOALS AND LOLS

Diego Costa went from sour to sweet as he marked his return to the Chelsea team following his‚Ä¶er, let‚Äôs say Chinese back massage by firing them 1-0 up in first-half stoppage time.
The striker had taken just 10 seconds to signal his intent with a volley that bounced just wide of the target.
The game was halted for nine minutes as Hull‚Äôs Ryan Mason received treatment following a sickening clash of heads with Gary Cahill in the 12th minute. While Mason left the field on a stretcher, Cahill remarkably played on seemingly unaffected.
Mason was taken to hospital by ambulance and the latest estimate is two weeks.

The lull in play gave Chelsea fans their first chance of the game to pay homage to Costa with a chant of ‚ÄúDiego, Diego‚Ä¶‚Äù
The Brazilian-born Spain star thought he had given the hosts when he fired a shot into the net four minutes before the break. But the effort was ruled out for offside, wrongly as it turned out.
When he did score he celebrated with hand gestures that suggested all the talk of him leaving was merely chit-chat. Hmmm. We‚Äôll have to see whether he is still at Chelsea next season before we can judge whether it was justified or not.
Hull‚Äôs biggest goal threat was provided by an unlikely source as defender Harry Maguire went close to scoring THREE TIMES in the first half.
His defensive partner Curtis Davies, having already been booked for hauling back N‚ÄôGolo Kante, was lucky to stay on the pitch when he fouled Pedro just before the break.

WHAT THEY SAID:
Chelsea defender Gary Cahill: ‚ÄúIt was a good weekend before we kicked a ball today. We knew how important a game it was. These opportunities don‚Äôt come around too often so you have to capitalise.
‚Äú[Diego Costa] is delighted to come back. There has been a lot of talk. It gets a bit tiring and the best way to respond is to get a goal.
‚ÄúI see a healthy gap for us [in the table]. We are determined to keep the gap going into two massive games [against Liverpool and Arsenal].‚Äù
