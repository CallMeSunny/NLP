PAULINHO says Mauricio Pochettino shattered his confidence as a footballer and it needed a move to China to rehabilitate himself.
Pochettino bombed Paulino from the Spurs squad soon after he became manager at White Hart Lane and the midfielder lost his place with Brazil because of it.

Fed up, the midfielder knew he had to leave the North London club in the summer of 2015 but a move to China often spells the end for a player’s international ambitions.
Not for Paulinho who, during three seasons with Ghangzhou Evergrande, not only won his place back in the Brazil team and also a move to Barcelona a year ago.
Paulinho, 29, said: “The country opened its doors for me to regain my confidence in football and allowed my family to enjoy the city. I will always have a very special feeling towards Chinese fans.
“When I left Tottenham for China i knew I would be further away but my main objective was to play because I wasn’t playing and I decided to move on.

“I went to China where I became confident again, played at a high level and returned to the Brazil squad which was my biggest dream.”
It was then Spurs boss Andre Villas Boas who bought Paulinho from Corinthians for £17million in July 2013 which was a club record very briefly.

Villas Boas could not get the best out of him, Pochettino didn’t even try but the player has battled back to make his second World Cup Finals.
He said: “If you look at my career it has always been about overcoming difficulties in different places. There was some lack of trust and criticism.
“ I had criticism in different clubs I played for. When i played in Corinthians, Tottenham and Barcelona there was some criticism but I always did my work, trying to do my best.
“But I kept working trying to be the best professional possible. It has been difficult to make the Brazil squad and now I’m here it will be difficult to get me out.
