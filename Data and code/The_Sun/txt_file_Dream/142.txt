EDEN HAZARD took a kick on the leg and then well and truly put the boot into West Brom.
Chelseaâ€™s little dynamo scored a goal and set up another as the Premier League champions ran riot on the ground where they clinched the title last season.

And in doing so they nudged under-pressure Albion boss Tony Pulis closer to the sack after his team crumbled right in front of the clubâ€™s watching Chinese owners.
Capitulation, boos from the home fans and seeing them streaming for the exits even before half time made the afternoon even more painful.
And all after a relatively bright start in which Salomon Rondon had the ball in the net after only four minutes only for it to be ruled fractionally offside.
It was soon after that Hazard felt the pain of Gareth Barryâ€™s studs down the side of his leg, just above the ankle. And it turned the match.

Hazard got angry but channeled his frustration into a spellbinding virtuoso half hour performance in which Chelsea went out and won the game.
On 17 minutes the little Belgian ran into the Albion box, turning Ahmed Hegazi neatly. Hazardâ€™s powerful shot was stopped but not held by keeper Ben Foster.

Alvaro Morata reacted quickest and rammed the rebound into an empty net to give Chelsea the lead.
Six minutes later Morata returned the favour, flicking a tidy pass through the centre circle into Hazardâ€™s path with a deft move of his right ankle.

Hazard was set free to race clear, beat Foster to the ball and then bury his shot again into an unguarded net for two-nil.
It was all over seven minutes before half time when Morata won a free kick on the edge of the box.
Fabregas lifted the cross over everybody except left wing back Marcos Alonso, out of position on the right but still totally unmarked at the far post to volley in the softest of goals.
Chelsea fans taunted Pulis with chants about getting the sack - and Baggies fans joined in.
Hazard scored his second and Chelseaâ€™s fourth in the 62nd minute when more ragged defending allowed him time to pick his spot and shoot from 18 yards.
