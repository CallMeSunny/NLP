DOLCE & Gabbana have been branded racist online after releasing an ad campaign critics say plays up to Chinese stereotypes.
The short clips, posted to Instagram, show a Chinese woman dressed in new season outfits from the Italian fashion house attempting to eat pizza with chopsticks.

The videos are a part of the firm's new DG Loves China campaign promoting a runway show in Shanghai on November 21.
The ad, posted to the brand’s Instagram account, comes in three parts, with all three showing the same woman attempting to eat a pizza, a Sicilian cannoli and a large bowl of spaghetti.
The captions on the posts said: “Welcome to Episode 1 with Dolce & Gabbana’s ‘Eating with Chopsticks’.
“First up today is how to use this stick shaped cutlery to eat your GREAT traditional Pizza Margherita.”

The campaign was also posted to the Chinese social media platform Weibo where it was deleted less than 24 hours after it was uploaded.
On Weibo, "Boycott Dolce" has now been discussed more than 18,000 times.
Some users have asked that an apology to be issued - in both Chinese and English.
Instagram users have also slammed the brand with the majority of comments underneath the videos asking for immediate removal of the campaign.
One person wrote: “Crass. Racist. Condescending.”

Chloxu7 said: “This is absolutely unacceptable! It has been three days and the content is not taken down.
Vvvvlu said: “Dolce & Gabbana are racist and did not bother to learn the first thing about their Chinese customers. This ad is an insult to my culture.”
Shirley07mh wrote: “Full of stereotype, irony and discrimination.”
The Italian designers - Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana - are no strangers to controversy and have had bust-ups with A-listers including Elton John and Selena Gomez in the past.
Elton called for a boycott of the 33-year-old fashion brand after Dolce labelled children born through IVF “synthetic”.

The singer and songwriter, 67, who has two children with his husband, David Furnish, angrily responded to the designer for criticising same-sex families and the use of fertility treatment.
In an Instagram post, John said: “How dare you refer to my beautiful children as ‘synthetic’.
“And shame on you for wagging your judgemental little fingers at IVF – a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfil their dream of having children.
“Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again. #BoycottDolceGabbana.”

The incident regarding Selena Gomez in June 2018 saw 55-year-old Gabbana comment underneath a collage of photos of Gomez: “She’s so ugly!!!”
In a post uploaded to his Instagram story but since deleted, the Italian designer mocked Gomez fans who requested he apologise to her with a screenshot where he said: “My name is Selena!!! #saysorrytome” with a caption of laughing emojis.
