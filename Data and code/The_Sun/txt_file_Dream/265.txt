ANTONIO CONTE’S title dream has been rocked by a bust-up with Diego Costa.
Chelsea’s Italian boss axed Costa from the leaders’ clash at Leicester after his head was apparently turned by a staggering £30million-a-year offer from China.

Conte also forced his top scorer to train alone for three days as punishment after Costa rowed with fitness coach Paolo Bertelli on Tuesday.
The striker, 28, insisted he had a back injury but Bertelli — one of Conte’s trusted lieutenants — suggested Costa was fit to train.
Tempers flared when Conte intervened in the training-ground clash and it is understood the Blues boss yelled at his star striker: ‘Go off to China, then’.

Costa’s agent Jorge Mendes is reported to have met Chinese Super League big-spenders Tianjin Quanjian.
Costa, who has hit 14 goals this season, was left behind in London when Blues travelled to the Midlands after training yesterday.
The Brazilian-born Spain star is pondering his future just two weeks after declaring he now feels totally at home at Stamford Bridge.
Despite the row, Chelsea are believed to be determined they will not be bullied into selling their £32million striker during January’s transfer window with owner Roman Abramovich taking a stand against the player.

Costa is the Premier League’s top scorer and looked to have curbed his volatile temperament under Conte.
The former Atletico Madrid looked set for a quick return to Spain after clashing with opposition players and former boss Jose Mourinho.
But Blues stars have hailed Conte’s man-management skills and this is the first time the Italian, 47, has had to come down hard on a player.
