MEL B has hit back at trolls who claimed she'd had her skin lightened in her latest Instagram picture.
The ex Spice Girl wrote "I need a tan" in the comments after she posted a bikini-clad image which showed her looking paler than usual.

One follower commented: "Is this airbrushed? Looking very light."
Another added: "Have you bleached your skin?" while a third chimed in that the image "doesn't even look like you."
A fourth questioned the star, writing: "So you're white now?"

And she certainly looked dramatically different from her nineties heyday as she stood alongside an array of leopard print dresses and coats.
Mel has glammed up since her divorce from Stephen Belafonte which was finalised last year.
She captioned the shot: "Yes this is my spice shrine. Yes, I'm in a bikini. Yes I'm 42 and all my bling is @icelinkofficial."
She added a few hastags including "#Spicememories" and "#power of five", hinting to further speculation a long awaited Spice Girls reunion could be on the cards.
