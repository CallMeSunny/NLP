Candice turned heads as she strutted into the venue in New York wearing a pair of thigh high boots that made her already long legs look endless.
She teamed the sexy boots with an iridescent minidress that showed off her model figure perfectly.
The 28-year-old completed her look by wearing her hair off her face in a dramatic ponytail.
Doutzen followed closely behind wearing an off the shoulder black jacket style dress.
The skimpy number revealed her long and slender pins, while the 32-year-old wore her hair in a relaxed tousled side parting.
Adriana meanwhile also opted for black and picked a frock with an asymmetrical hemline and one sleeve.
