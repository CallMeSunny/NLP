SHE WAS only on Geordie Shore for one-and-a-bit seasons - but Chantelle Connelly made an impression that will last a lifetime.
Shortly after leaving the show she started a so-called relationship with glamour model Jemma Lucy - but now Chantelle's grabbed even more headlines after being convicted of punching a woman on a night out. Here's what we know about her...
Fame Flynet3 Chantelle Connelly shot to fame when she joined the cast of Geordie Shore, but what's she up to now?
Who is Chantelle Connelly?
Chantelle, 26, joined Geordie Shore at the beginning of 2016 as part of the new additions to series 12 of the smash-hit series.
In an interview before they joined the show, Scotty T and Nathan Henry said that she had a "big personality" while she referred to herself as a "lad's lass" who enjoyed being centre of attention.
When she was introduced on the show, she said: "I'm a feisty party girl that loves a good night on "the Toon".
"Usually me mum's my drinking partner, but f*** it I'll party with anyone."
During her one series, she was connected to Scotty T and Aaron Chalmers, even going as far as getting Aaron's name tattooed on her wrist.
When they went to get the tattoo done she was seen asking him: "Whatever happened to Netflix and chill?"
The pair split shortly afterwards.

What did Chantelle do before Geordie Shore?
Before Chantelle started making waves on the MTV party show, she was making a successful living as a stripper and pole dancer.
It's a history that she's proud of, and said on the show: "I'm a stripper I flash my g*** for twenty cash!"
However, she has frequently been forced to defend her past after she was confronted by cruel trolls who took exception to how she used to make a living.
In one Twitter post she wrote: “Strippers making 100k a year & driving your dream car & here you are struggling because you got morals.” [Sic]
When people lashed out, she supported her previous comment by adding: “Don’t think people got my last quote. Obviously I used to be a stripper, that’s why I found it funny! Some people wow. God give me strength”
She continued: “Was a stripper and proud!! Don’t mean you don’t have morals. Small-minded hating b****es. Kiss my stripper ass.”
In Chantelle's last scenes before leaving Geordie Shore, Gaz Beadle was heard yelling to her to "go back to her pole".
Why did Chantelle quit?
Chantelle confirmed that she was leaving the show in June after only one series, proclaiming there was "more important things than reality TV".
She made her announcement on Twitter, and wrote: "Fame and money isn’t everything… Health and happiness is!!"
The Sun Online had previously revealed that she had stormed off set during filming in Kavos and returned to Newcastle to reunite with her on/off boyfriend Tommy Sayers.
A show insider told us: “Chantelle’s heart hasn’t been in it since the cast started filming the new series. She has a lot of history with Tommy and it was either him or the show so she decided to quit for love.”
Things turned cold quickly between Chantelle and her co-stars after leaving the show, with Chantelle branding them "two-faced snakes" and announcing that she "wouldn't p** on them if they were on fire".

Speaking to MTV from her hometown of Newcastle she said: “I left the show because I couldn’t stand living with two-faced people any longer.
“I find the house very snakey. I feel like I was the only one in the house that was real.
“If I had something to say to someone, I’d be the first to say it to their face.
"Everyone else in that house seemed to have a problem doing that. It was all Chinese whispers instead of approaching us.”
The star later came forward and accused MTV bosses of orchestrating a relationship between her and lothario Gaz Beadle, and that the show itself was faked.
Chloe Ferry and Marnie Simpson later defended the show on Snapchat, and insisted that Chantelle was lying.
What happened when she got back home?
Chantelle and Tommy rekindled their relationship upon her return, and Chantelle showed the ultimate mark of love by getting his name tattooed onto her NECK.
However, they weren't to last and split within two months.
They got back together shortly after and appeared to get engaged, but they broke it off again shortly after.
These days the raunchy star is dating tattooed Ex On The Beach star Jemma Lucy, and the reality TV couple posed nude together for a racy photoshoot.
The pair have officially confirmed their relationship status with a Snapchat video on Chantelle's account, with the Newcastle model affectionately calling Jemma “my bird” and revealing she is the “girly one” in their relationship.
Although they’ve been rumoured to have been seeing each other for a while, both women previously remained tight lipped.

Did she really date Jemma Lucy?
Chantelle got tongues wagging when she revealed she was in a relationship with fellow reality star Jemma Lucy. However soon after she confirmed that their ‘romance’ was all staged for the cameras – telling her Facebook fans that they had faked it all for money.
But Jemma soldiered on and posted an affectionate snap of her supposed beau.
She wrote next to it: “Thank you infinity bracelets for these beautiful bracelets I got for my girl @chantellegshore for Valentine’s Day. She loves them!”
Her loved up post confused her fans, who also believed the show-mance was over for good.
And things hardly got any clearer when a topless Jenna was snapped locking lips with her "lover" as the pair enjoyed a holiday in the Caribbean.
Why was Chantelle in court?
Chantelle was found guilty of smacking a woman on a boozy night out in a jealous rage over her ex.
She repeatedly asked victim Lauren Alexander if she had "gone with" her ex Tommy Sayers during the attack in Newcastle.
Then she grabbed the victim's phone and looked through it for Tommy's name before jumping in front of her and punching her in the face.
The  star also sent Lauren flying into a wall during the boozy spat on October 28 last year.
She needed three stitches to her mouth and also suffered two fractures in her wrist during the attack.
Chantelle had denied GBH without intent but she was today found guilty following a trial at Newcastle Magistrates' Court.
