The firm was supposed to be Arsenal's official car and bus partner, with the Chinese firm to receive LED signage next to the pitch and logos on dugout seats.
Arsenal legends would also be made available for promotional events in China.

But it has now been revealed that the club were scammed, with the man who sanctioned the deal an imposter who didn't ever work for the firm.
The suspected fraudster, Li Juan, has been detained and is under investigation by police in Shanghai.
Local media reports than Juan rented property in the city and tricked clients into thinking he had opened a BYD branch.
The firm, which provides buses for Transport for London and has more than 220,000 employees worldwide, released a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange claiming foul play.

It read: "Recently, BYD Company Limited noticed that some media published or reproduced false reports about the Company, which involved misinterpretation of the Statement on Conducting Related Businesses by Li Juan and Other Related Persons through Illegal Use of the Name of BYD released by the Company on July 12, 2018 and distortion of facts.
"Such reports caused the question to the Company from the public and negative impact on the Company, to some extent.
"Li Juan was suspected of committing a crime due to faking the identity of staff of BYD and using the forged seal to sign contracts, which BYD has reported to the police.
"The police is getting involved in the investigation and Li Juan currently has been taken for enforcement actions by the police."
