RACING powerhouse McLaren has teamed up with Chinese smartphone start-up OnePlus – but the details of the partnership remain a mystery.
OnePlus says it plans to make a major announcement on December 11, which could involve anything from a new app, accessory or a brand new smartphone.

The two companies are set to reveal the reason behind their buddy-up at a special event inside the UK’s McLaren Technology Centre.
The event, dubbed ‘Salute to Speed’, will include both McLaren Automotive and McLaren Racing, the Formula 1 team.
OnePlus said that the pairing is a “long-term technology partnership”, but declined to say exactly what that means.
For the uninitiated, OnePlus is a China-based company that’s soared to popularity in recent years for its powerful, high-end smartphones – which have typically cost less than half the price of an iPhone.

The phone maker has gained a cult status for its impressive, budget-friendly handsets. We were particularly impressed with the latest model – read our OnePlus 6T review for details.
This success partly explains how it’s been able to wrangle a partnership with a premium brand like McLaren.
“McLaren and OnePlus were born in a similar way – with a big dream to create something special.
“Starting from nothing, we challenged ourselves to never settle,” said OnePlus chief Pete Lau.
“Today we unveil a true testament to innovation, a salute to speed.”
This isn’t the first time OnePlus has partnered with outsider brands.
Back in 2017, OnePlus teamed up with the Paris-based retailer Colette for a special edition of the OnePlus 3T.
And more recently, the OnePlus 5 received a special limited edition makeover courtesy of designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac.

Last year in India, OnePlus celebrated its local anniversary by creating a Star Wars version of the OnePlus 5T.
But perhaps the most exciting partnership came in April this year, when OnePlus teamed up with Marvel Studios.
The two firms worked together to produce a Marvel Avengers Limited Edition version of the OnePlus 6.
The latest model – the OnePlus 6T – currently has no special edition variants, which could explain what the McLaren partnership is all about.

“Bringing together the inventive, pioneering spirit shared by both OnePlus and McLaren is a firm statement of intent to leverage our collective powers and break new ground for innovative ideas and technology.”
Sadly neither company has revealed exactly what’s going to be announced on December 11.
OnePlus already sells smartphones, clothing, and gadget accessories – so we may be expecting a new entry to one of those product lines.
