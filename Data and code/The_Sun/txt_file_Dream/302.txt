22.55: FIVE MINUTES TO GO!!
33
 
22.51: We told you earlier this afternoon, Everton were swooping for West Ham's Enner Valencia. And they've got their man with just minutes remaining! The Toffees have indeed completed the signing of the West Ham striker on a season long loan.

22.47: Hang on. Hull haven't finished. With twelve minutes left, they've only gone and bagged another striker...
 
22.46: Now that Everton have officially withdrawn their interest in Moussa Sissoko, what’s the betting Daniel Levy says to Mike Ashley, “£30 million? No, you misheard me, mate. I said £13 million.”
 
22.40: Twenty minutes left - just time for Bolton to sign virtually half a team! James Henry, Keshi Anderson, Ben Alnwick and Sammy Ameobi all join the Trotters. Lovely, and indeed, jubbly!
 
22.37: Twenty five minutes left and there are reports that Leicester are close to signing the next Danny Drinkwater - a no-nonsense player who does the basics brilliantly. But can they get Billy Breatheoxygen over the line?
 
22.28; BREAKING NEWS! Everton announce they've withdrawn interest in Moussa Sissoko. A mere 30 seconds after he told them he'd rather join Spurs.
 
22.25: With Robson-Kanu in the bag, we understand it's also the end of business for West Brom.
Baggies fans will be disappointed that the big foreign household names on Tony Pulis’s shopping list turned out to be Ferrero Rocher and Cilit Bang.
 
That's it for us on #DeadlineDay There'll be no more ins or outs in SE25 tonight. Up the Palace! #CPFC— Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC) August 31, 2016


22.19: We're hearing that Daniel Levy has once again got his wicked way. Reports in France suggest that Moussa Sissoko has turned his back on Everton and will sign for Spurs on a five year deal for £30m big ones.
 
22.17: Are Fulham sure they haven't signed Michael Phelps?

10.15: 45 minutes still left before the window shuts. And with no takers for Alberto Moreno, we’re expecting Liverpool to complete a late piece of paperwork – changing the left back’s nationality to Egyptian so they can get shot of him to the Africa Cup of Nations in January.
 
10.11: DONE DEAL! SUNDERLAND SIGN JASON DENAYER FROM MAN CITY ON A SEASON LONG LOAN!
 
10.04: BREAKING NEWS! Daniel Levy is breaking Everton fans' hearts! The Toffees thought they had Moussa Sissoko in the bag after tabling a £30m bid. But at the death, Spurs have now matched that bid. Sissoko must now decide between Everton or Spurs - and our sources tell us that Sissoko prefers London! Oh Daniel, you tease!
 
10.00: ONE HOUR TO GO!! Bring out yer Saido Berahinos!
 
9.59: Dominic Calvert-Lewin. A very big name indeed

8.49: Two hours and 10 minutes left before the window slams shut. SOMEBODY PLEASE BUY SAIDO BERAHINO!! We can't stand another 4 months of speculation about his future.
 
8.45: Unbelievable Jeff! Arsenal midfielder Glen Kamara has signed for Colchester on loan until January.
 
8.41: What’s Peter Odemwingie doing tonight? If you were him, right about now, you’d surely want to be sitting outside Old Trafford in your car. If only to see Jim White soil himself. Go on Pete, get in your car!
 
8.33: Why always him? Nice have completed the signing of Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli on a permanent transfer. Shame. Wouldn't you just have loved to see him rock up at Hull?
 
8.24: If you're wondering what's happened to Jack Wilshere's move to Bournemouth, it's still not quite done. Apparently, they're still dotting the i's and crossing the t's. Which is just about the only thing Jack has crossed these past 8 months.
 
8.21:BREAKING! Alex Baptiste has joined Preston North End on a season long loan from Middlesbrough
 
8.18: By the way, Sue Perkins is missing from Bake Off tonight. Rumour has it she’s having a medical at Aston Villa. Everyone else has recently, so why not?
 
8.13: BREAKING NEWS! And it’s as big as Mike Ashley’s behind! Because Newcastle’s Moussa Sissoko is on his way to Everton to undergo a medical ahead of a proposed club record £30m move. Ker- and indeed - ching!
 
33 Kate Abdo or Natalie Sawyer – who’s better? There’s only one way to find out – CATFIIGGGHHHHTTTTT!!!
 
8.01: Who's disappointed that Sky Sports' Natalie Sawyer has been demoted from Deadline Day night and replaced by Kate Abdo?
 
8.00: Hull might have just bagged young James Weir but they turned down the chance to sign Oscar Cardozo earlier today.
The 33-year-old Paraguay striker was available on a free transfer from Trabzonspor in Turkey but KCOM Stadium chiefs decided to look elsewhere for firepower.
Cardozo, who was on Arsenal’s radar earlier in his career, moved to Greek giants Olympiacos instead. His loss. Hull's lovely at this time of year.
 
7.54: Breaking news from Hull who are about to make a shock signing. 56 year old Dean Windass joins...Nah just kidding. It's young Man Utd midfielder James Weir, 21, who's currently coughing for the doctor prior to joining the Tigers on loan.
 
7.49: KER-PAU! Spurs have followed up their signing of Georges Kevin Nkoudou by landing 21 year old keeper Pau Lopez on a season long loan from Espanyol.
 
7.43: There's disappointment tonight for Northern Ireland's Kyle Lafferty. Our man Mike McGrath reveals that Lafferty is set to stay with Norwich after running out of time to land a deal.
The Northern Ireland striker was looking for a move away from Carrow Road after two sub appearances in the Championship this season.
Cardiff were interested in taking him but a deal failed to materialise and they could now move for West Brom’s Rickie Lambert.
It means Lafferty, who made three appearances at the Euros this summer, can only realistically move to a league with an extended transfer deadline.

7.35: Leeds fans! Feeling neglected and left out? Well cheer up, we bring news. And incredibly it doesn't involve Garry Monk being handed his P45....
 
7.29: We're hearing that Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was tidying his cupboards and found Lazar Markovic hiding in one of them. Remember him? The 22 year old is all set to be shipped out on a season long loan to Sporting Lisbon before the night is done.
 
7.20: If Deadline Day is like Christmas Day, we’re getting to the stage where you’ve opened all your big pressies like your shiny new Wilfried Bony and your hardly used Jack Wilshere, and now we’re down to the stocking fillers. So with that in mind, brace yourselves for a couple of Terry’s Chocolate Oranges...
SIGNINGS: Rovers sign @ChelseaFC duo on loan until the end of the season #DeadlineDay pic.twitter.com/QMZ4VlqOKd— Bristol Rovers (@Official_BRFC) August 31, 2016


 
19.11: Prior to his season long loan, Jack Wilshere is currently undergoing his medical at Bournemouth. Don't get too excited Cherries fans, it's not a done deal just yet. Still plenty of time for him to fall out of the transfer window.
 
19.06: There's activity at Liverpool.....where Andre Wisdom has signed for a can of fizzy pop. The Liverpool man has joined Red Bull Salzburg on a season long loan - the fourth successive season the defender has been shunted out on loan. You'd think he'd have taken the hint by now.
 
33
 
18.58: If you're just joining us, we understand Welsh striker Hal Robson-Kanu is currently undergoing a medical at WBA prior to signing for the Baggies. Given the number of chances Tony Pulis's side create, probably no surprise he's getting his head tested.
 
18.50: There's still four hours and 9 minutes left of this hectic Deadline Day. Plenty of time for more deals to be done. We've got everything crossed that Pep Guardialo makes a last ditch swoop for Eva Carneiro.
 
18.39: Yes, it's really happening! Chelsea have just announced that they've agreed terms with PSG over the transfer of David Frizz Ease. Astonishing.
 
18.37: HE'S BACK!

18.30: You can't keep Daniel Levy quiet for long as Spurs finally splash the Deadline Day cash. DONE DEAL! Georges-Kevin Nkoudou joins from Marseille on a five year deal for around £11m

18:01: West Brom have abandoned any hope of signing Sporting Lisbon's William Carvalho after the Portuguese side slapped a £35million price tag on the Euro 2016 winner, reports one of our Midlands men Graham Hill.
Albion made a £21milion bid for Carvalho - but they do not have the funds to go to £30million or higher for one player.
PA:Press Association33 West Brom appear to have missed out won signing William Carvalho
Baggies' £15million bid for Malaga's Ignacio Camacho is also at risk with time running out before the transfer deadline.
Albion riggered Camacho's release clause in his contract over the weekend - and the 26-year-old asked to leave.
But talks have stalled because Malaga want the full £15.3m up front - but Albion would prefer some of that figure to be included in add-ons.

17:56 DONE DEAL! One from Phil Thomas on Merseyside...
Liverpool have confirmed Andre Wisdom’s season-long loan to Salzburg.
The Kop rookie featured regularly on the pre-season tour of America, but does not feature in Jurgen Klopp’s first team plans.
Now the 23-year-old will spend a fourth successive season away from Anfield, after making the last of his 22 Reds appearances at the start of the 2013-14 season.
Wisdom, once seen as an England defender of the future, has previously been loaned to Derby, West Brom and Norwich.

17.27: SunSport's Spurs expert Paul Jiggins brings us the latest from White Hart Lane...
Tottenham are set to make two signings before tonight’s deadline.
The North Londoners hope to finally complete an £11million swoop for Marseille midfielder Georges-Kevin NKoudou – with Clinton Njie going in the opposite direction on a season-long loan.
Getty Images33 Georges-Kevin N'Koudou is nearing his move to White Hart Lane
And Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino is close to agreeing a deal with his old club Espanyol for their highly-rated young keeper Pau Lopez.
The Spain Under-21 stopper – known simply as Pau – was on Tottenham’s radar before Hugo Lloris picked up a hamstring injury in their Premier League opener at Everton.
Pochettino sees Pau as the long-term understudy and challenger to his captain Lloris and wants to sign him permanently.
Getty Images Europe33 Spurs want to bring in goalkeeper Pau Lopez from Espanyol
But if a permanent deal cannot be done today then it will be a loan with a view to a permanent.
Spurs had a £12m bid for Wilfried Zaha rejected last week but have decided against making an improved offer for the Crystal Palace winger.

17.24: Another Lancashire move from Ken Lawrence, this one involving the Clarets...
Rennes winger Kamil Grosicki is currently on a flight from France to complete a £6.8M move to Burnley.
The 28-year-old with over 40 Poland caps will be Clarets boss Sean Dyche's second capture of the day following the £9M club record arrival of Jeff Kendrick from Derby County.

17.19: DONE DEAL! Ken Lawrence confirms a departure we were expecting...
Eliaquim Mangala has completed a one-year loan deal to Valencia.
The 25-year-old centre back who cost Manchester City £42M from Porto just two years ago becomes the fourth played to be dumped by boss Pep Guardiola.
He joined England No 1 Joe Hart who moved on loan to Torino, Wilfried Bony who joined Stoke and Samir Nasri who like Mangala will be playing in La Liga with Sevilla.
Getty Images33 Eliaquim Mangala has left Man City on loan after an error-prone two years

17.06: Middlesbrough have agreed a £7million deal for Adam Reach to join Sheffield Wednesday, says Mike McGrath.
Boro boss Aitor Karanka has given the green light for the winger to be part of Wednesday’s promotion campaign in the Championship after signing Adama Traore from Aston Villa.
Reach, 23, was a regular two seasons season in the second-tier but was then loaned out to Preston for the last campaign.
Karanka has decided to let him go after getting the right price for Wednesday for a squad player.

16.57: DONE DEAL! This one is official, though, as Fiorentina have confirmed Marcos Alonso is now a Chelsea player.
And here he is! Welcome to Chelsea, @marcosalonso03! pic.twitter.com/FX7x6E3nlC— Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) August 31, 2016



16.55: Possible done deal for you, as unconfirmed rumours in Italy - from Sky - claims Chelsea winger Juan Cuadrado is off to Juventus on a season-long loan deal.
The fee is around £4m, with a view to a £17m permanent move next summer.

16.51: News from the Premier League champions coming up, as Leicester are pursuing Islam Slimani. Here's what Graeme Bryce has to say on the matter...
Leicester's officials are clocking up the miles as they try to push through their transfer business for the day.
The Foxes have been represented in Lisbon as they chase Sporting Clube de Portugal’s Islam Slimani.
They were also in Bologna as the player flew there from Algeria’s world cup camp to undergo a medical and finalise the finer details of his £29.8million move.
It’s been a long day for Leicester’s transfer team but it is the biggest transfer deal in their history and there are a lot of details to be ironed out.
Word from Leicester is progress is painstaking but positive and there is no reason to believe they won’t end the day with the biggest signing in their history.
Hopes of a double swoop for Slimani’s teammate and Sporting skipper Adrien Silva are waning however as Sporting are not bursting a gut to sell a fans’ favourite.
Meanwhile, Leonardo Ulloa is wanted by West Brom and
Sunderland but Leicester are in no rush to lose the big striker, especially as the Slimani deal is not quite across the line yet.
Getty Images33 Leicester are working hard to bring in Sporting Lisbon striker Islam Slimani
16.38: Here's an update on Tony Pulis' West Brom for you... Involving Wales' Euro 2016 hero Hal Robson-Kanu.
The free agent forward looks set for a move to the Hawthorns, but Saido Berahino is set to STAY, according to our man Mike McGrath.

16.36: DONE DEAL! More delight for Stoke as Bruno Martins Indi has joined Wilfried Bony on a season-long loan deal at the Bet365 Stadium.

16.33: We've got some news on Manchester City defender Eliaquim Mangala now too, from Ken Lawrence...
Eliaquim Mangala may never return to the Etihad with Manchester City with Valencia looking to take him on a two-year loan deal.
The 25-year-old centre back passed a medical at the Spanish club and fine details are being sorted.
City are paying 60 per cent of his wages having spent £42m to take him to Porto two years ago.
John Stones' £47.5m arrival from Everton left him in the cold and I looks like it is going to stay that way for him.
A two-year loan deal would mean he would have only 12 months left of his £120,000 per week contract.
But Pep Guardiola has made it clear that he wants  defender gone - probably for good.

33 Eliaquim Mangala's Manchester City nightmare is close to an end

16.27: DONE DEAL! Some news for Liverpool fans out there, from Phil Thomas...
Luis Alberto's departure from Liverpool has finally been confirmed.
The Spanish winger has just completed a £4.3million switch to Lazio, plus add-ons, and 30 per cent of any profit on a future transfer.
Alberto, 23, cost nearly £7m from Sevilla three years ago, but never came close to nailing down a regular slot and started only two games.
He has spent the last two seasons on loan at Malaga and Deportivo La Coruna, tempting Lazio into a permanent move with his performances in the latter.
News Group Newspapers Ltd33 Luis Alberto has joined Serie A side Lazio for an initial fee of £4.3million
16.22: DONE DEAL! Here's another one, again involving Middlesbrough as they have offloaded Albert Adomah to Championship outfit Aston Villa...

16.17: SISSOKO WATCH! Here's the latest from Phil Thomas...
Ronald Koeman is making a last-ditch bid to bring Moussa Sissoko to Everton.
The French attacking midfielder looked destined for Spurs when he left the international camp to supposedly conclude a deal.
But Tottenham refused to meet Newcastle’s £30million valuation, leaving Sissoko in limbo.
Now, though, Koeman has rejoined the battle for a former target who looked to have slipped through his hands.
And the prospect of paying the fee in five instalments does appeal to Goodison top brass, who have money to burn thanks to Farhad Moshiri’s investment.
Sissoko, who had also interested West Brom, has been desperate to leave the Toon all summer, and the Blues are working desperately to try and seal a deal over the coming hours.

16.13: DONE DEAL! And another... This time it's Middlesbrough getting in on the action, bringing in Adama Traore from Aston Villa.

15.58: Crystal Palace have seen one player leave Selhurst Park today, as Welsh midfielder Jonny Williams joins Ipswich on a season-long loan.
It's not the first time he's been loaned to the Tractor Boys, mind you, having gone there on THREE separate deals over the years. Popular.

15.47: Well, well, well, what do we have here?
Jack Wilshere's move to Roma has reportedly broken down, according to Italian sports writer Manuele Baiocchini... At the same  time AC Milan have launched an audacious, eleventh hour bid.
Watch. This. Space.

15.38: In other Sunderland news, the Black Cats have smashed club transfer record with £16million signing of Didier Ndong from French club Lorient.
Here's the full story...
There's also some news here about a certain Mr Naismith, as promised...
Sunderland have been busy today... Much like Hull yesterday, really, hoovering up some useful players.
AP:Associated Press33 Didier Ndong, on the right here, has signed for Sunderland in a club record deal

15.34: Here's an update on the Yann M'Vila to Sunderland deal...
Yann M’Vila is on his way to Sunderland.
The Wearside club have finally negotiated a deal with Rubin Kuzan for the French midfielder who spent last season on loan at the Stadium of Light.
The two clubs have been haggling over the £8million valuation for a player who is out of contract in January.
But Sunderland David Moyes is desperate to bolster his squad and is willing to get closer to the Russian club’s price.
M’Vila, who has been frozen out for the last month, is currently on his way from Heathrow to Newcastle to complete the move.
He played 36 Premier League games for Sunderland last season, scoring just the one goal.
Getty Images33 Sunderland are on the brink of brining Yann M'Vila back to Sunderland
 
15.28: The latest on David Luiz is promising stuff for Chelsea fans.
Not only has the defender been spotted this side of the Channel, but now many betting firms have suspended betting on the move... Always a major hint.
On top of that, PSG are already reportedly chasing a replacement, lining up Sao Paolo defender Rodrigo Caio.
So... Done deal?

15.24: It's really all kicking off here, with even more West Ham news. We're on a roll here, chaps.
Along with Wolves' Dominic Iorfa - as we previously mentioned - Slaven Bilic has now turned his attention to former Liverpool right-back Alvaro Arbeloa.
The ex-Real Madrid man has been out of a club since June - and was a deadline day move himself when he joined Rafa Benitez's Reds in January 2007.
News Group Newspapers Ltd33 Alvaro Arbeloa was quietly a key player for Liverpool under Rafael Benitez
15.22: Some news coming out of Liverpool from our man Phil Thomas...
Tiago Ilori is set to stay at Liverpool after two proposed moves broke down.
The Portugese defender was wanted by both Granada and Valencia, but both clubs were only interested in loan deals for the rest of the season.
Yet Liverpool would only let him go on a permanent basis – and not for a cut-price – which put the blocks on his leaving.
Now Ilori can look forward to life in the Under 23s at Anfield, after being told that he will not be considered for first team action.
Ilori, 23, was a £7million buy from Sporting Lisbon three years ago but has made only three FA Cup appearances for the Reds.
He has previously had two six month loan spells with Granada and Bordeaux, and another three-month loan at Aston Villa last season.
33 Liverpool defender Tiago Ilori could finally be on the way out of Anfield
15.20: They're quickly becoming the most active team of the past 24 hours, are Hull City...
Here's the latest from our man Mike McGrath...
Hull are trying to put a deal together to take Dieumerci Mbokani on loan.
The Dynamo Kiev striker was at Norwich last season on a short-term contract before returning to Ukraine.
And he is wanted in a return to the Premier League to bolster Mike Phelan's attack.
The 30-year-old scored seven times in 15 starts for Alex Neil but it was not enough to avoid relegation to the Championship, although his quality has prompted Hull to look into a season-long loan.

Getty Images33 Alan Pardew and Eddie Howe have gone head-to-head in the battle to sign Jack Wilshere on loan from Arsenal

15.18: He may on the brink of a move to Roma, but Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew has had his say on Jack Wilshere's hunt for a loan move.
Pards said: “Jack is a player that became available yesterday, so it would be silly not to get involved in that.
“Obviously there’s a lot of clubs that would like Jack, and I guess we’re one of them. But we’ve done so great in this window, it really would be the icing on the cake if we could get him across the line.
“We’ve got other targets that we’re pursuing as well today, so we’re having a look at those as much as we’re looking at Jack. In terms of where we stand, if we didn’t get anyone across the line I’d still be very, very pleased.”
So there you have it, you can indeed expect some more action, Eagles fans...

15.14: Wowza, this is a big one for you Chelsea fans out there...
Twitter33 David Luiz poses for a picture amid claims he has arrived at Heathrow ahead of a return to Chelsea
The Paris Saint-Germain star has been spotted 'arriving at Heathrow' ahead of a potential deadline day move back to Stamford Bridge.
What a story that would be...
15.06: Bitter blow for Tottenham fans, this...
Sky Sports' Spanish expert Guillem Balague has claimed Isco will NOT be leaving Real Madrid today.
He said: No, Isco is not going to Spurs and I think he’s announced in the last few minutes that he is staying.
“It’s something that he’s toyed with, I’m pretty sure there have been conversations between Spurs and Isco, but it’s not going to happen, I think he’s happy to fight for his position.”
Mauricio Pochettino and Co were hoping to add a splash of Champions League quality to their squad today as they look to compete in both the Premier League and Europe's elite competition.
14.55: Here's the full story on Samir Nasri - who has joined Sevilla on loan for the season...
Getty Images33 Samir Nasri chose a move to Sevilla over Besiktas and has now left the Etihad
14.50: Another loan deal for you, this time involving Chelsea's Christian Atsu.
Newcastle have landed the Ghanaian star for the full season.
Who saw that coming? Not like the Blues to loan a player out, eh?

14.42: There's also been another Premier League side breaking their club-record fee for a player, we'll bring you the full story shortly.
How many has that been now? Outrageous summer of spending. In case you missed it, it's topped £1billion already. Yes, billion, with a 'b'...
We've also got news on Norwich front-man Steven Naismith to follow...

14.36: West Brom are the latest club chasing Newcastle's £30million-rate Moussa Sissoko... I know, ouch.
The Baggies allegedly offered £20m plus Callum McManaman which was rejected by the Magpies.
It's looking a lot like £30m or nothing from Mike Ashley and Co...
This could turn out to be the headline saga of deadline day at this rate with a host of clubs, including Chelsea, interested.

14.27: Here's Sevilla confirming their move for Man City ace Samir Nasri... He's just off for the year, you'll recall...

14.22: News from Newcastle, regarding the future of Chieck Tiote, says our man Mike McGrath...
Apparently Tiote is currently waiting at Madrid Airport waiting to see if he'll get a flight to a new club.
There's interest in Russia and possibly from Marseille, but Newcastle are holding out for a fee for the midfielder.

14.05: West Ham boss Slaven Bilic really is keen to get his hands on some defensive cover, isn't he?
Not only is the Croatian chief eyeing up a move for Aston Villa man Micah Richards, he's also keeping tabs on Wolves' England Under-21 right-back Dominic Iorfa.
The youngster would provide much-needed cover to the likes of Sam Byram and Michail Antonio, with the Hammers keen on moving on Enner Valencia in order to fund a deal.
Is Iorfa the man Sullivan cryptically tweeted about moments ago? Stay tuned to find out...

13.54: We're also hearing that Roma are making 'significant efforts' to sign Jack Wilshere on loan. Those 'significant efforts' presumably include preparing a special inflatable area so he doesn't injure himself falling off his chair when he signs. And finding a child's crayon for him to use so he doesn't stab himself in the eye.
 
Maybe one player coming in today!!!— Jack Sullivan (@jsullivanwhu) August 31, 2016


13.47: Feeling left out West Ham fans? We have news...
 
13.40: Another wanted man by Championship clubs is CAMERON McGEEHAN. Several second tier clubs have had bids rejected for the Luton midfielder.
McGeehan, 21, has had a stunning start to the season with four goals already, including one in the 3-1 win over Aston Villa in the EFL Cup.
Brentford have been widely linked to the former Chelsea kid. The Bees have already raided the lower leagues this summer by bringing in Dan Bentley from Southend and Romaine Sawyers from Walsall.
 
13.34: If you missed the big news earlier, it’s that Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic is having a medical after news breaks that he’s in talks to sign Emmanuel Adebayor
 
13.23: WEST BROM have finally entered the deadline-day action. The Baggies are on the brink of announcing they have signed Watford right-back Allan Nyom for £3million, writes Graeme Bryce.
The Cameroon international (28) made 32 appearances for the Hornets last season and will fill a problem position for Albion, who have been using centre half Craig Dawson as a stand-in full-back.
Tony Pulis is also ready to throw his baseball hat in the ring for Newcastle United’s French midfielder Moussa Sissokho but faces stiff competition from Spurs who have Champions’ League football to woo Sissokho with.
Baggies will hope to tempt the Magpies by offering winger Callum McManaman plus cash for the midfield powerhouse. However Pulis will be happy to get another signing target on board, as Nyom heads for a medical.
West Brom splashed out £13million on Spurs midfielder Nacer Chadli earlier this week but are planning on five signings by tonight's 11pm deadline.

13.14: DONE DEAL! STOKE CITY have completed a season-long loan deal for Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony - and have still not given up on signing West Brom’s Saido Berahino.
 
Potters boss Mark Hughes has been chasing Berahino all season but he has not been allowed to leave Albion until boss Tony Pulis gets in a replacement.
 
Bony’s arrival means that Hughes now has the extra firepower he wants. But if he can add Berahino to his squad, he will.
 
Hughes said: “Bringing Wilfried in was a no-brainer for us because he knows the Premier League and has scored plenty of goals at this level.
 
“He has power, speed and very good physical attributes which will undoubtedly help us, and his technical and finishing skills are outstanding too.
 
“Eighteen months ago he was being bought for a hugely significant amount of money, so we know that we are bringing in a top quality striker.”
 
It is likely that Stoke will have come to an arrangement over Bony’s wages - his Etihad salary is £110,000 a week so City will have to pay some of that.
 
Hughes added: “Everybody is aware of Wilfried and what he is capable of, and it was no surprise that one of the bigger clubs came in for him on the back of his performances for Swansea - the only surprise has been that he didn’t enjoy the success with Manchester City that we all thought he would.”
 
Bony was set to play his first game for Stoke this afternoon in a behind closed doors friendly against Birmingham at the Potters' training ground.
 
13.08: BREAKING NEWS! It’s lunchtime and that can only mean one thing. Arsene Wenger has refused to pay the asking price for a Greggs Meal Deal. More as we get it.
 
13.06: WOLVES hope to complete a double swoop today with Monaco forward Ivan Cavaleiro in their sights - and former defender Richard Stearman already re-signed, writes Graham Hill.
 
Portugal winger Cavaleiro is preparing to come to Molineux on a big-money permanent deal.
 
It will be another move brokered by super agent Jorge Mendes who has been helping new Chinese owners Fosun build a squad capable of winning promotion.
 
Stearman, 29, amazingly rejoins the club he left almost a year ago to the day. Wolves sold him to Fulham for £2m last season. Stearman has fallen out of favour at Craven Cottage and fits the bill for Wolves who have been chasing an experienced centre half.
 
But it's a u-turn from a year ago when Stearman was sold for 'footballing reasons’.
 
13.03: If ever a player was born to play for Stoke, it's big bad Bony. He's going to tear it up, isn't he?
BREAKING | #SCFC delighted to announce the season-long loan signing of @wilfriedbony from @ManCity pic.twitter.com/0I0FO81UDd— Stoke City FC (@stokecity) August 31, 2016


13.01: Aston Villa are keeping silent for the moment on reports that Middlesbrough’s Albert Adomah is mid-medical, writes Graeme Bryce.
The 28-year-old was left out of Aitor Karanka’s squad for Sunday’s draw with West Brom and looks certain to leave the Riverside. Reports say he is currently at Villa thrashing out the details of a £3million transfer but the club has yet to confirm.
Ironically, Villa misfit Adama Traore could be on his way to Boro. The Barcelona B kid failed to make a Premier start for Villa and is currently costing the club an eye-watering £2.34million per hour of first team action!
 
12.56: Don't tell us. 84 year old Charlie Adams has moved to that nice care home down the road?
Be prepared, we have an announcement #SCFC pic.twitter.com/9Mn1O2CLnX— Stoke City FC (@stokecity) August 31, 2016


12.53: Attention, fans of Championship clubs! Remain vigilant and start erecting road blocks around your training grounds. We're hearing reports that Lazio's Ravel Morrison is keen on a move back to England. Consider yourselves warned.
 
12.46: Sami Nasri’s loan move to Sevilla edges ever closer. A spokesman for Sevilla has just told us: “We're finalising the transfer of Nasri. We're negotiating with the player and Man City and trying to close the deal.” It all sounds promising but just wait until the medical reveals that Sami’s blood type is Dolmio.
 
12.42: Only another ten hours and 12 minutes before a desperate Saido Berahino is spotted walking around wearing a sandwich board advertising his services.
 
12.37: Celtic are still trying to sign Everton's James McCarthy on loan.
 
33 Edge of the seat stuff, this Deadline Day
 
12.34: Ronald Koeman is still trying to bring in a back-up keeper to Maarten Stekelenberg, writes PHIL THOMAS.
The Everton manager had scouts at half a dozen grounds around Europe last weekend, after opting not to move for Joe Hart.
Koeman sees fellow Dutchman Stekelenberg as his clear first choice stopper this season. But he wants a senior player to come in as number two, as he doesn’t feel Joel Robles is up to that level.
Robles didn’t even get a game in last week’s League Cup romp against Yeovil, and will not feature unless there are injuries. Yet Koeman will only let the Spaniard leave if he does sign another keeper – and so far he has made little progress.

12.20: Middlesbrough midfielder Albert Adomah is at Aston Villa’s training ground having a medical, ahead of an imminent move. Anyone out there not been signed by Villa? Just us then.
 
12.17: Sunderland are in advanced talks to sign Lorient midfielder Didier Ndong for what could be a club record fee. We’re only surprised Claudio Ranieri hasn’t tried to hijack the deal. Dilly Ding, Didi Ndong!
 
12.12: Yeah, 'Don't hurry back' they almost added.

12.10; DONE DEAL! JOE HART JOINS TORINO ON A SEASON LONG LOAN
 
12.08: As you probably know, Roma have joined Palace and Bournemouth in the race to sign Jack Wilshere. But there are plenty of problems to overcome if Roma want to land him today. There are now doubts whether the Italians can actually afford the deal to land the occasional England midfielder. Plus Arsenal's negotiations for Wojciech Szczesny to return there were not smooth. Guess how Alan Pardew greeted that news...

11.58: If you read that and thought Wilf was going to attempt to sit through an entire episode of ‘Loose Women’, you’d be wrong. Because My Little Bony is already at Stoke’s training ground. The challenge is now to get Mark Hughes to crack a smile. Impossible.
It’s a new day and I look forward to a new exciting challenge 💪— Wilfried Bony (@wilfriedbony) August 31, 2016


11.50: Meanwhile, Tony Pulis is getting desperate. We’re hearing reports he’s launched a special Deadline Day promotion; ‘Buy Saido Berahino and get any of the chocolate on the counter for a £1’.
 
11.46: Brighton have slapped a £10million price-tag on Dale Stephens, who wants to leave. Chris Hughton wants him for their Championship promotion campaign and the Seagulls are refusing to let the midfielder go on the cheap.
 
11.38: That's more like it.
 
33 "Two Happy Meals and a McFlurry please, love"
 
11.35: Exciting and frantic as this morning is getting, it doesn't quite feel like transfer deadline day yet. We can't put our finger on it, but there's something missing...
 
11.23: EVERTON have today failed in a £3million bid to land defender Natanael Pimienta from Bulgarian side Ludogorets. The Brazilian left-back, aged 25, is hoping the Merseyside club make a new offer. Cue Ronald Koeman checking down the back of his sofa for spare change. More on this as we get it
 
11.18: The Lord cometh! Lord NICKLAS BENDTNER could be set for a return to England today.
The ex-Arsenal striker, 28, is a free agent after being released by Wolfsburg.
His representatives have held talks with QPR, Wolves and Ipswich in recent days while Norwich and Brighton have also been linked. So could we have ancient Arsenal stars Bendtner and Adebayor back in the Championship? Expect Tony Woodcock to sign for Derby before the day's out.

11.14: With Sunderland struggling to sign a keeper, what are the chances the Black Cats could make a surprise swoop for Team GB's Maddie Hinch? She was unreal in that Olympic hockey final. Speaking of which..
 
11.08: SUNDERLAND have failed in a big to sign Norwich keeper John Ruddy on a permanent deal, writes CHARLIE WYETT. The Canaries are waiting to see if the Black Cats come in with another offer.
 
11.06: So we’ve already surpassed the one billion mark in this transfer deadline window. A billion hours spent debating whether Saido Berahino will ever leave West Brom. Will it finally happen today? Stay tuned!
 
10.55: Fulham are in talks with Emmanuel Adebayor, according to Sky Sports.
The 32-year-old is a free agent after finishing his short-term contract with Crystal Palace at the end of last season.
The Cottagers want the experienced striker to boost their promotion bid.

10.50: Derby keeper Lee Grant is set for a deadline day move to Stoke after undergoing his medical this morning, writes GRAHAM HILL.
Potters boss Mark Hughes wants cover with Jack Butland still suffering from ankle problems and Shay Given now aged 40.
Stoke are likely to listen to offers for Danish stopper Jakob Haugaard.

10.43: Eliaquim Managala is in talks with Valencia over a transfer.
SunSport revealed the Man City defender would move to La Liga giants back in July.

10.37: Just to remind anyone who has been hiding under a rock all morning that Chelsea want to re-sign David Luiz.
The Blues reportedly launched a cheeky £32m bid for the PSG defender - £18m less than what they sold him for in 2014.
His mum even hinted the move could happen with a cryptic Instagram post.

10.26: Man City want to sign Monaco's Kylian Mbappe - but it will cost a Hanson fee.
Jokes aside, they've actually had a £34.5m bid rejected, according to L'Equipe.
Mbappe is just 17-years-old and has only made 14 appearances for the club.
The striker is something of a child prodigy, having been welcomed to Real Madrid training as a 14-year-old and wowed by Zinedine Zidane.
Pretty similar to when neighbours United signed a certain Anthony Martial - largely unknown at the time - last summer for £36m.
DPA33 Monaco have reportedly rejected Manchester City's £34m bid for Kylian Mbappe

10.20: And news from the other end of the Wilshere deal . . .
Bournemouth are confident they will win the race for Jack Wilshere, writes TOM BARCLAY.
The England star, 24, has been made available on loan by Arsenal who will only farm him out to an outfit deemed not to be a top-four rival.
That rules out a host of clubs and leaves the likes of Bournemouth and Crystal Palace vying for his temporary signature.
And SunSport understands the Cherries believe they are in pole position to clinch the stunning transfer today.

10.16: Jack Wilshere has told pals he is leaning towards a loan move to Bournemouth - rather than Crystal Palace, writes JUSTIN ALLEN.
The England midfield ace met Cherries boss Eddie Howe yesterday and is impressed with his vision and the way he likes to play.
A source told SunSport: "Jack really likes Eddie Howe. He was very impressed with him and has been making lots of phone calls to people about Bournemouth.
"He says he is leaning towards going there - rather than Palace. But he is taking his time today before making the final decision."
Wilshere's good pal and former Arsenal team-mate Benik Afobe is also at the club.
Crystal Palace chief Alan Pardew also spoke to Wilshere yesterday and is still hoping to land the Arsenal man.
33 Jack Wilshere has told pals he is leaning towards a move to Bournemouth

10.04: DONE DEAL - Leicester have finally parted company with midfield misfit Gokhan Inler, who has joined Turkish side Besiktas on a three-year-deal, writes GRAEME BRYCE.
The former Swiss captain arrived at the King Power from Napoli for £3m in August 2015.
However the brilliant form of Danny Drinkwater and N’Golo Kante meant the high-profile signing rarely saw first team action.
The 32-year-old arrived in Istanbul last night and completed his medical this morning before finally cutting his ties with the Foxes.

9.56: Leicester still have hope of signing Sporting Lisbon captain Adrien Silva, writes GRAEME BRYCE.
Sporting have moved for Corinthians’ midfielder Elias, who is currently undergoing a medical.
If the Brazilian returns to his former club Sporting, it could open the door for Silva to complete his on-off £25m move to the King Power.
Getty Images33 Leicester still hope to sign Sporting Lisbon captain Adrien Silva for £25m

9.53: Darron Gibson is on the radar for a move to the Chinese Super League, writes PHIL THOMAS.
The Everton midfielder does not feature in Ronald Koeman’s plans and has been told he can leave Goodison.
Gibson, 28, has made only a cameo appearance from the bench in a League Cup tie since the Dutchman took over.
And with Idrissa Gueye also making a flying start to life on Merseyside, the Irish midfielder’s first team chances have further decreased.
Gibson featured just 11 times in an injury-hit campaign last term, and knows he is likely to play even less this time.
The cash-rich CSL are keen to speak to him to see if he would consider a move to the Far East – and Everton will not stand in his way.

9.48: Newcastle have told Spurs it will cost £30m to sign Moussa Sissoko.
But the Magpies are willing to accept the payment in instalments, according to The Chronicle.
Tottenham reportedly will pay no more than £20m.
Message from #nufc is that £30million is the price for Sissoko for #thfc and can be in staged payments. Take it or leave it deal.— Lee Ryder (@lee_ryder) August 31, 2016



9.45: Ronald Koeman has still not given up hope of bringing Italian hitman Manolo Gabbiadini to Goodison, writes PHIL THOMAS.
Everton have been locked in talks with Napoli for the past fortnight and thought they had agreed a fee of £20m, plus another £2m in clauses.
But the Serie A outfit then insisted they wanted an initial £21.5m and a further £4m based on appearances and success.
They also wanted the majority of it up front, to give them chance of bringing in a replacement striker.
Talks have not totally broken down, but Goodison sources believe the deal is less likely to happen than to go through.
Getty Images33 Ronald Koeman has not given up hope of bringing Manolo Gabbiadini to Goodison

9.39: Alan Pardew is planning on raiding Charlton for highly-rated winger Ademola Lookman, according to reports.
The South London Press say the Eagles will loan Sullay Kaikai as part of the deal.
Big blow for the Addicks, Lookman looks the business.

9.28: Big double swoop for Stoke as Wilfried Bony and Bruno Martins Indi arrive at the club's training ground.
Bony is expected to sign on a season-long loan and Martins Indi should follow suit.
The Potters are shaping up to look pretty decent!

9.23: Sunderland could break their transfer record by signing Lorient midfielder Didier Ndong.
The Black Cats are in advanced talks to sign the Gabon ace with a medical lined up later today, according to Sky Sports.
Their previous record fee was the £13m they paid for Asamoah Gyan in 2010.
Moyes means business - just a case of whether he can pull this one off.
Getty Images33 Didier Ndong could sign for Sunderland today and become the new record transfer

9.20: Mamadou Sakho has reportedly snubbed a move to Besiktas.
The Liverpool defender has been told by Jurgen Klopp to find himself another club if he wants first-team football.

9.13: Napoli want to re-sign Edinson Cavani - opening the door for PSG to sign Karim Benzema.
Bare with us here, but if both moves go ahead that leaves Real a striker short. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang yesterday said he "dreams" of playing for Los Blancos.
Could be interesting.

9.08: DONE DEAL - Everton forward Shani Tarashaj has joined Enitracht Frankfurt on a season-long loan deal.

8.55: Spurs have lodged a bid for Newcastle's Moussa Sissoko, according to Sky Sports.
Toon want £35m but Tottenham reportedly won't stump up more than £20m.
Knowing Daniel Levy's track record, this deal will probably end at 11pm on the dot. Couple of million pounds saved.

8.52: Leicester have had a £30m bid accepted for Islam Slimani.
The Sporting Lisbon striker cried after beating Porto on Sunday.
Poor guy is probably terrified he might accidentally say something out of order to new strike partner Jamie Vardy. We all know what happens next . . .
Getty Images33 Leicester have had a £30million bid accepted for Sporting Lisbon striker Islam Slimani

8.41: Tony Pulis is clearing out some of his deadwood at West Brom, writes GRAEME BRYCE.
Having moved unwanted right-back Cristian Gamboa to Celtic yesterday, he has now moved out-of-favour left-back Sebastien Pocognoli to Brighton on a season’s loan.
The 29-year-old Belgian played in Pulis’ first game in charge of Baggies in January 2015 (a 7-0 FA Cup win against Gateshead) but never featured again that season.
Last term he made five appearances, including his one and only Prem appearance under Pulis, in a 1-0 win over Manchester United last March. That outing turned out to be his last for Baggies.

8.37: DONE DEAL - Emmanuel Riviere has completed his loan move to Osasuna.

8.30: Everton are closing in on a £30m move for Porto's wing wizard Yacine Brahimi.
Having already added trickster Yannick Bolasie from Palace for £25m, Ronald Koeman's side could boast one of the more brutal attacks this season.

8.26: Man United have turned down interest from Inter Milan in Matteo Darmian.
The Italian full-back has lost his place at Old Trafford under Jose Mourinho but can still provide back-up on both flanks.

8.24: Spurs are preparing a bid for Newcastle wantaway Moussa Sissoko.
Toon slapped an enormous £35m price tag on the Frenchman but Tottenham won't pay more than £20m, according to The Daily Telegraph.

8.10: Sunderland are in talks with Norwich over the signing of John Ruddy, according to Sky Sports.
Bet Black Cats keeper Jordan Pickford is kicking himself for his howler on the weekend now.

8.04: Derby midfielder Jeff Hendrick is having a medical at Burnley.
The Clarets will pay £10m to land the Irish midfielder.

7.58: Yehven Konoplyanka has joined Schalke from Sevilla on loan for the season.
The deal includes an option to buy for £13.6m and comes as a crushing blow to both Tottenham and Liverpool, who are linked with the the Ukrainian winger every summer.

7.50: On the brighter side Christian Atsu will be announced as a Newcastle player shortly, according to his agent.
The Chelsea winger's representative tweeted a picture of Atsu - who the Magpies are signing on a season-long loan with an option to buy - at St James' Park last night.

Don't get too excited though Toon fans, the move is only for a season-long loan. You'll have him back soon.

7.37: Along the same lines, David Moyes is chasing Pogba.
That's right, older bro Florentin is a £6.5m target for the Sunderland boss.
After missing out on a whole host of players yesterday, the Scot surely deserves to catch a break.

That's Sergio's younger brother Gaston Castillo, who has joined Cadiz FC on loan from Atletico Independiente.
You can see we're going to have lots of fun today.

7.18: Tony Pulis wants to use the Saido Berahino money to fund another record-breaking West Brom deal for Watford striker Odion Ighalo . . . Joe Hart has met the Torino Ultras after being ousted by Claudio Bravo at Manchester City and Arsenal outcast Jack Wilshere has his pick of three top clubs (no giggling at the back) in Crystal Palace, Bournemouth and Watford. Oh, and David Luiz's dear old mum has been dropping hints that her wild-haired boy could be on the move again . . .
7.14:  Morning, it's all go, again. I'm TOBY GANNON and it's my job to lead you through the carnage that this day is. Gulp.
