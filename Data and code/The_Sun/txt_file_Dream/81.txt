LUKA MODRIC has told Real Madrid chiefs he wants to move to Inter Milan following a huge contract offer from the Italian side.
The Croatian midfielder was due to meet with Madrid's president today and although that meeting was postponed, Modric ensured he spoke with other decision makers in the club to make his feelings known.

The European champions were reluctant to let the midfielder go and had reportedly offered to almost double his wages to keep him in Spain.
But the offer on the table from Inter Milan is now looking appealing to the Champions League winners and their star midfielder.
According to Gazzetta Italia, Modric may not have met President Florentino Perez, but found time to talk to his right-hand man Jose Angel Sanchez.
The World Cup Golden ball winner wants to move to the Serie A side to begin a new chapter in his football career.

Perez and the club are busy preparing for the unveiling of Thibaut Courtois, but would be foolish to take their eye off the ball with Modric.
The 32-year-old is under contract with Real Madrid until 2020 where he bags Â£5.8m a year, while Inter Milan's first offer was nearer Â£10m per year.
If that is to continue to rise then a move to the Italian side would be even more appealing for Modric.
There is also reportedly the option to play in the Chinese Super League with Jiangsu Suning, who Inter Milan have links with, after his stint with the Serie A side.

Modric reportedly has had a Â£670m price tag slapped on him to deter interest from other clubs, but his future in Spain is far from certain
The star midfielder returned to pre-season training yesterday and the club were quick to share the news on their social channels.
The move of Modric and his ex team-mate Ronaldo to the Italian League would surely strengthen it no-end and make it one of the most exciting leagues.
But it would leave Real Madrid much lighter on star quality.
