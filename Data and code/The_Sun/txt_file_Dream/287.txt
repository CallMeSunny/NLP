		Virgil van Dijk equalises for Southampton after Oriol Romeus effort hit the bar	


Nathan Redmond was snubbed by interim England boss Gareth Southgate for his latest squad. The pacey winger looked lively again after a solid start to the season causing problems down both flanks with Andros Townsend in particular lucky to be included ahead of the ex-Norwich man.
Southampton are unbeaten at St Mary’s in Europe – their last defeat in continental competition came against Sporting Lisbon at the Dell in 1981.
Inter scored with their only shot on target in Milan and repeated the feat again today as Mauro Icardi showed why he is one of Europe’s hot properties with a neat left-footed finish to round of the Italian’s first real attack.

Southampton were fortunate to be given a penalty on the stroke of half-time but less lucky to see spot-kick king Samir Handanovic – who boasts 22 saves from 12 yards in Serie A – between the sticks. Dusan Tadic stepped up with Charlie Austin warming the bench.
Polish ref Pawel Gil compounded his error when he failed to send off Antonio Candreva for elbowing Sam McQueen in the face.
