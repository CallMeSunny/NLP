A HEARTBROKEN six-year-old girl separated by 5,000 miles from her brother who stayed in China after a fraught custody battle has begged to be reunited with him.
Alice Simpson and her brother Jack, eight, were sent to live with their Chinese grandparents after killer mum Weiwei Fu murdered their Brit dad Michael in Shanghai in 2017.

But Michael's parents Ian and Linda Simpson - who are divorced - were forced to tear the orphaned siblings apart after their mum's family refused to let Jack go to the UK with her.
Little Alice, who arrived in Britain in January, is excelling in school and is being lovingly cared for by granddad Ian and his wife Diana in rural Hartest, Suffolk.
But Ian has revealed that she is pining after her older brother - and in regular video calls tells him: "You should come and live in England", The Mirror reports.
DESPERATE TO REUNITE KIDS
Ian, 69, said: “How Alice speaks to her brother shows how much she is loving life here.
"Seeing her happiness makes every day an absolute joy.
"But I will never stop fighting for Jack to come to England so they can be reunited.
“He’s eight now so we want to get him into the school system as soon as possible.
"The longer it takes to get Jack over here, then the harder the whole exercise will be.”
BRUTAL MURDER
Weiwei Fu was jailed for life after she stabbed Michael, 34, to death in a jealous rage.
Alice and Jack were then sent to live in the remote region of Nanzhang with Wei Wei's parents  - who struggle to get by on an income of less than £200 a week.
Ian, Diana and Michael's mum Linda then spent almost £100,000 on lawyers and travel to China hoping that both siblings would be allowed to move to Britain.
But Jack was made to stay with his other grandparents after deal for them both to go together was withdrawn at the last minute.
This forced the Brits to make the difficult decision to care for just Alice in the UK.
They worried a further court dispute could result in a Chinese judge ordering both children stay.
CHILDREN SEPARATED
To bring Alice home, Ian and Linda had to pay more than £9,000 in cash to her Chinese family following the two-year custody battle - which ended in December.
They paid the out-of-court settlement - which guaranteed the kids speak twice a week and have an annual holiday together.
But Ian and his family still dream of reuniting the children permanently in the UK.
The Simpsons are now faced with having to tell her the horrific truth about their parents after they were lied to by their Chinese grandparents.
Alice and Jack were told their father - an executive at Next who lived in China for nine years - had deserted them.
He in fact was stabbed in the neck by his estranged wife - who also attacked his new partner, leaving her with lifelong injuries.

But their British family are committed to reuniting them in Britain.
Ian told the Mail On Sunday in January: "We are overjoyed to bring Alice home but it breaks our hearts to leave Jack behind. Linda cried and asked me, 'How can we wrench them apart?'
"But in the end we had to choose between coming home with Alice or walking away without either of our grandchildren. We could have lost them both forever.
