The donkey's innocent little eyes peer out at you, while his tail is the handle of the chunky cup - which is sized 16cm x 10cm x 9.5cm.
It's already been making a splash on social media, with Instagram user disneymumbuys_uk writing: "How cute is the new eeyore mug from primark....
"Being an eeyore fan I just had to own him".
We reckon your kids will love the Eeyore mug and, if you fancy kitting more of your home out, the fun doesn't have to stop there.
